","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Innovative solutions are needed when resources from different countries are required to work more closely together. Such solutions should support the development of the EU’s Security Union.
Scope:
Sub-topic 1: [2018] Common requirements specifications for innovative, advanced systems to support security (CSA)
Practitioners from several countries are invited to work on common requirements of any kind of system that they may need in the future to enhance border and external security, to fight against crime and terrorism, to protect infrastructure, or to make societies more resilient, and to involve their respective procurement bodies in preparing for future acquisitions. Practitioner organisations may be private or public entities.
To ensure that the outcome of this action becomes also available to EU Member State national authorities as well as EU agencies not participating for further procurement purposes, proposals must necessarily state:
(1). Agreement from participating procurement authorities to negotiate, in good faith and on a case-by-case basis, with non-participating procurement authorities that wish to procure a capability or a product fully or partly derived from this action, the use of the information required to run such a procurement process, and solely for that purpose.
(2). Commitment from participating procurement authorities to consult with any legal entity generating information to be released for the purpose set out in paragraph (1), unless contrary to applicable legislation.
(3). Commitment from participating procurement authorities to negotiate the use granted under paragraph (1) on Fair Reasonable and Non-Discriminatory (FRAND) terms.
The following options of the Model Grant Agreement will be implemented:
- Options on additional exploitation obligations of Article 28.1 of the Model Grant Agreement will be applied.
- Grants awarded under this topic will be complementary to the grant agreement under Sub-topic 2 of this Topic. The respective options of Article 2, and Article 41.4 of the Model Grant Agreement[1] will be applied.
A subset of the domains addressed by the proposals selected for funding by the Commission further to this call will be continued with pre-commercial procurement activities in 2020.
Proposals should lead to solutions to be developed in compliance with European societal values, fundamental rights and applicable legislation, including in the area of free movement of persons, privacy and protection of personal data. Societal aspects (e.g. perception of security, possible side effects of technological solutions, societal resilience) have to be taken into account in a comprehensive and thorough manner. All participating procurement authorities should also commit to comply with EU data protection legislation in the development of innovative, advanced systems to support security and in particular with the principles of data protection by design and by default.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of about EUR 1 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Sub-topic 2: [2020] Procurement of prototype systems among those specified as a result of Sub-topic 1 (PCP)
The Commission invites practitioners involved in projects funded under Sub-topic 1 to submit proposals for this PCP stage based on requirements resulting from those projects.
Phase 1: To finalise the tendering documents package for a call for tenders to build security-relevant prototypes based on the technical input resulting from Sub-topic 1 of this Topic. To define clear verification and validation procedures, methods and tools for the evaluation of the prototypes to be developed throughout the PCP stages;
Phase 2: To implement the call for tenders for research and development services. The call for tenders should envisage a competitive development composed of different stages that would lead to at least 2 prototypes from 2 different providers to be validated in real operational environment at the end of the PCP cycle;
Phase 3: To conduct the competitive development of the prototypes following the PCP principles including, at least, a design stage, an integration and technical verification stage and a validation in real environment stage. This process should be assessed following the procedures for verification and validation defined in the Phase 1;
Phase 4: To consolidate the results of the evaluation of the developed prototypes, extract conclusions and recommendations from the validation process, and to define a clear strategy for the further uptake of solutions. This strategy should consider joint-cross border procurement schemes and exploit synergies with other EU funds.
Proposals must build on the outcomes of the projects funded under Sub-topic 1. In order to guarantee a successful implementation of the PCP, proposals must provide clear evidence that such projects have delivered concrete outcomes on the following aspects:
- That the challenge is pertinent and that indeed a PCP action is required to complete the maturation cycle of certain technologies and to compare different alternatives;
- That there is a consolidated group of potential buyers with common needs and requirements which are committed to carry out a PCP action in order to be able to take an informed decision on a future joint-procurement of innovative solutions;
- That there is a quantifiable and identifiable community of potential buyers (including and beyond those proposed as beneficiaries in the proposal) who would share to a wide extent the common needs and requirements defined and who would be interested in exploring further joint-uptake of solutions similar to those developed under the PCP, should these prove to be technologically mature and operationally relevant by the end of the project;
- That the state of the art and the market (including research) has been explored and mapped, and that there are different technical alternatives to address the proposed challenge;
- That the future PCP tendering process is clear, that a draft planning has been proposed and that the supporting documentation and administrative procedures will be ready on due time in order to launch the call for the acquisition of R&D services according to the PCP rules.
To ensure that the outcome of this action becomes available for further procurement purposes to EU Member State national authorities as well as EU agencies not participating, the proposal must provide evidence of the following:
(1). Agreement from participating procurement authorities to negotiate, in good faith and on a case-by-case basis, with non-participating procurement authorities that wish to procure a capability or a product fully or partly derived from this action, the use of the information required to run such a procurement process, and solely for that purpose;
(2). Commitment from participating procurement authorities to consult with any legal entity generating information to be released for the purpose set out in paragraph (1), unless contrary to applicable legislation;
(3). Commitment from participating procurement authorities to negotiate the use granted under paragraph (1) on Fair Reasonable and Non-Discriminatory (FRAND) terms.
The centre of gravity for technology development with actions funded under this subtopic is expected to be up to TRL 8 – see General Annex G of the Horizon 2020 Work Programme.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 2 to 12 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Proposals should ensure that solutions will be developed in compliance with European societal values, fundamental rights and applicable legislation, including in the area of free movement of persons, privacy and protection of personal data. Societal aspects (e.g. perception of security, possible side effects of technological solutions, societal resilience) have to be taken into account in a comprehensive and thorough manner. All participating procurement authorities should also commit to comply with EU data protection legislation in the development of innovative, advanced systems to support security and in particular with the principles of data protection by design and by default.
Expected Impact:
Short term:
Common requirements for innovative prototypes agreed among the practitioner organisations involved in the action;
Technical tender documents ready for use by subsequent pre-commercial procurement actions, as well as by non-participating procurement authorities;
Common solutions to address urgent security challenges jointly developed, integrated and valuated;
Potential demand for security solutions, inspired by those developed, is aggrevated.
Medium term:
To develop common technical specifications and reference performance levels for joint EU security solutions;
To pave the road to market for technically mature and operationally relevant solutions and to accelerate their wide deployment in the EU.
Long Term:
To contribute to narrowing down the gap between research and the market for the next generation of security solutions;
To contribute to a single EU security market, by reducing market fragmentation and allowing exploitation of economies of scale;
To facilitate access of new innovative players to the public procurement market;
To contribute to reinforcing the competitiveness of the EU technology and industrial base.
Delegation Exception Footnote:
For 2018, 2019 and 2020 topics, this activity will be delegated to the Research Executive Agency, nevertheless the Commission reserves the possibility to exclude a specific project from the delegation to the REA if it appears that that project would necessarily have a close link to the development of EU policies in the field of security.

","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Algorithms, software and hardware systems must be designed having security, privacy, data protection, fault tolerance and accountability[1] in mind from their design phase in a measurable manner, taking into account future-proof, advanced cryptographic means. Relevant challenges include: (a) to develop mechanisms that measure the performance of ICT systems with regards to cybersecurity and privacy and (b) to enhance control and trust of the consumer of digital products and services with innovative tools aiming to ensure the accountability of the security and privacy levels in the algorithms, in the software, and ultimately in the ICT systems, products and services across the supply chain.
Scope:
Proposals are invited against at least one of the following three subtopics:
a) Cybersecurity/privacy audit, certification and standardisation
Innovative approaches to (i) design and develop automated security validation and testing, exploiting the knowledge of architecture, code, and development environments (e.g. white box) (ii) design and develop automated security verification at code level, focusing on scalable taint analysis, information-flow analysis, control-flow integrity, security policy, and considering the relation to secure development lifecycles, (iii) develop mechanisms, key performance indicators and measures that ease the process of certification at the level of services and (iv) develop mechanisms to better audit and analyse open source and/or open license software, and ICT systems with respect to cybersecurity and digital privacy. These approaches may be accompanied by creating information bases to measure and assess the security of digital assets. Proposals should make use of existing standards to the extent possible, and should strive to contribute to relevant standardisation efforts.
b) Trusted supply chains of ICT systems
Innovative approaches to (i) develop advanced, evidence based, dynamic methods and tools for better forecasting, detecting and preventing propagated vulnerabilities, (ii) estimate both dynamically and accurately supply chain cyber security and privacy risks, (iii) design and develop security, privacy and accountability measures and mitigation strategies for all entities involved in the supply chain, (iv) design and develop techniques, methods and tools to better audit complex algorithms (e.g. search engines), interconnected ICT components/systems (v) devise methods to develop resilient systems out of potentially insecure components and (vi) devise security assurance methodologies and metrics to define security claims for composed systems and certification methods, allowing harmonisation and mutual recognition based primarily on evidence and not only on trust.
The trusted supply chain for ICT systems/components should be considered by proposals in its entirety, in particular by addressing the IoT ecosystems/devices that are part of the supply chain.
c) Designing and developing privacy-friendly and secure software and hardware
Innovative approaches to establish methods and tools for (i) security and privacy requirements engineering (including dynamic threat modelling, dynamic attack trees, attack ontologies, dynamic taxonomies and dynamic, evidence based risk analysis), (ii) embedded algorithmic accountability (in order to monitor the security, privacy and transparency of the algorithms/software/systems/services), (iii) system-wide consistency including connection between models, security/privacy/accountability objectives, policies, and functional implementations, (iv) metrics to assess a secure, reliable and privacy-friendly development, (v) secure, privacy-friendly and accountability-enabled programming languages (including machine languages), hardware design languages, development frameworks, as well as secure compilation and execution, (vi) novel, secure and privacy-friendly IoT architectures enabling consistent trustworthy and accountable authentication, authorization and accounting services across IoT devices/ecosystems with enhancement of Public Key Infrastructures (PKIs) aiming to support PKI services (e.g. registration, revocation) for IoT devices.
For each of the sub-topics above, the outcome of the proposals is expected to lead to development up to Technology Readiness level (TRL) 5.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 4 and 5 million would allow this area to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
For grants awarded under this topic for Research and Innovation Action the Commission or Agency may object to a transfer of ownership or the exclusive licensing of results to a third party established in a third country not associated to Horizon 2020. The respective option of Article 30.3 of the Model Grant Agreement will be applied.
Expected Impact:
Short/medium term
Improved market opportunities for the EU vendors of security components.
Increased trust both by developers using/integrating the ICT components and by the end-users of IT systems and services.
Protect the privacy of citizens and trustworthiness of ICT .
Acceleration of the development and implementation of certification processes.
Long term
Advanced cybersecurity products and services will be developed improving trust in the Digital Single Market.
The use of more harmonized certification schemes will increase the business cases for cybersecurity services as they will become more reliable.
Validation platforms will provide assessments with less effort compared with nowadays and assure a better compliance with relevant regulations and standards.

","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
EU's strategic interest is to ensure that the EU retains and develops essential capacities to secure its digital economy, infrastructures, society, and democracy. Europe's cybersecurity research, competences and investments are spread across Europe with too little alignment. There is an urgent need to step up investment in technological advancements that could make the EU's digital Single Market more cybersecure and to overcome the fragmentation of EU research capacities. Europe has to master the relevant cybersecurity technologies from secure components to trustworthy interconnected IoT ecosystems and to self-healing software. European industries need to be supported and equipped with latest technologies and skills to develop innovative security products and services and protect their vital assets against cyberattacks. This should contribute inter alia to achieve the objective of European strategic autonomy.
The Public Private Partnership on Cybersecurity[1] created in 2016 was an important first step aiming at triggering up to EUR 1.8 billion of investment. However, the scale of the investment under way in other parts of the world suggests that the EU needs to do more in terms of investment and overcome the fragmentation of capacities spread across the EU. In this context in a recent Joint Communication[2] the Commission announced the intention to create a Cybersecurity Competence Network with a European Cybersecurity Research and Competence Centre.
Scope:
The objective of this topic is to scale up existing research for the benefit of the cybersecurity of the Digital Single Market, with solutions that can be marketable. For this, participants should in parallel propose, test, validate and exploit the possible organisational, functional, procedural, technological and operational setup of a cybersecurity competence network with a central competence hub. Projects under this topic will help build and strengthen cybersecurity capacities across the EU as well as provide valuable input for the future set-up of the Cybersecurity Competence Network with a European Cybersecurity Research and Competence Centre as mentioned by the Joint Communication.
To achieve the above, support will go to consortia of competence centres in cybersecurity to engage together in:
Common research, development and innovation in next generation industrial and civilian cybersecurity technologies (including dual-use), applications and services; focus should be on horizontal cybersecurity technologies as well as on cybersecurity in critical sectors (e.g. energy, transport, health, finance, eGovernment, telecom, space, manufacturing);
Strengthening cybersecurity capacities across the EU and closing the cyber skills gap;
Supporting certification authorities with testing and validation labs equipped with state of the art technologies and expertise.
Each proposal should bring together cybersecurity R&D&I centres in Europe (e.g. university labs/public or private non-profit research centres) to create synergies and scale up existing competences and demonstrated strengths to the European level. Proposals should take into consideration relevant active digital ecosystems and public-private cooperation models and focus on solving technological and industrial challenges. The centres within the proposal should aim to collectively develop and implement a Cybersecurity Roadmap covering the above and addressing multiple and complementary cybersecurity disciplines (e.g. cryptography, network security, application security, IoT/cloud security, data integrity and privacy, secure digital identities, security/crisis management, forensic technologies, security investigation, cyber psychology, bio-security). When developing the Roadmap the results of the work done by the cPPP on cybersecurity, notably its Strategic Research and Innovation Agenda, will serve as a starting point. Consideration should also be given to the relevant work of ENISA, Europol and other EU agencies and bodies.
The Roadmap should include targets to be achieved with deliverables by the end of the project (typically three to four years) that constitute clear milestones in its implementation, as well as priorities to be addressed in the future by the Cybersecurity Competence Network.
To implement this Roadmap, partners in the proposal(s) are expected to set up a functional network of centres of expertise with a coordinating ""competence centre"" (this role should be undertaken by one of the partners in the network, with the necessary capacity, resources and experience). Work includes the assessment of various organisational and legal solutions for the Cybersecurity Competence Network, taking into account various criteria, including the EU mechanisms and rules, national and regional funding structures, as well as those offered by industry. Based on the above work, a governance structure should be proposed (i.e. business model, operational and decision-making procedures/processes, technologies and people) and will be implemented, tested and validated in the demonstration cases (see below) involving all partners in the network to showcase (in a measurable manner) its performance and optimise the suggested governance structure.
Projects will demonstrate the effectiveness of their selected governance structure by providing collaborative solutions to enhance cybersecurity capacities of the network and develop cyber skills (e.g. by looking at models to align cybersecurity curricula at graduate/post graduate levels; align cybersecurity certification programmes; classify skills with work roles).
Projects should ensure outreach, to raise knowledge and awareness of cybersecurity issues among a wider circle of professionals, where possible in cooperation with EU and national efforts, and to spread the developed expertise.
Projects should also include industrial partners and their cybersecurity research collaborators to create synergies and: (a) collaboratively identify and analyse scalable (short/mid/long term[3]) cybersecurity industrial challenges in the selected sectors and (b) demonstrate their ability to collaborate in developing appropriate solutions to solve critical challenges through (not less than four) research and innovation demonstration cases.
These demonstration cases will constitute the core part of the work to be done within the project. They will be based on a specific research & development roadmap to tackle selected industrial challenges and will implement it covering a complete range of activities, from research & innovation through testing, experimentation and validation to certification activities.
Projects under this topic are implemented as a programme through the use of complementary grants. The respective options of Article 2, Article 31.6 and Article 41.4 of the Model Grant Agreement will be applied. Proposals shall therefore foresee resources for clustering activities with other projects funded under this topic to identify synergies, best practices and kick-off the process of creating the network involving the sub-networks already created by awarded projects. This task will contribute to the actual set-up of the Cybersecurity Competence Network and a European Cybersecurity Research and Competence Centre at a later stage.
A proposal must involve distinct cybersecurity R&D&I excellence centres in Europe (e.g. university labs, public or private non-profit research centres, taking into consideration public-private cooperation models and the ecosystems around them), with complementary expertise, from at least 9 Member States or Associated Countries. With the aim of reinforcing technology and industrial capacity as widely as possible across Europe, proposals should include a substantial representation of the most relevant RD&I excellences centres in Europe, with a widespread European coverage and good geographical balance of activities as regards the scope of work. This will ensure the proposals meeting the policy goals of the initiative of supporting the establishment of the future Cybersecurity Competence Network with a European Cybersecurity Research and Competence Centre of the European Union.
The consortium in a proposal must involve at least 20 partners.
A proposal should also include industrial partners from various (not less than 3) sectors (e.g. telecom, finance, transport, eGovernment, health, space, defence, manufacturing) that will be involved in the demonstration cases.
The support and involvement of the relevant governmental bodies and authorities (e.g. for monitoring and assessing the projects’ results during their life-cycles) will be considered as an asset.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution of up to EUR 16 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
For grants awarded under this topic the Commission may object to a transfer of ownership or the exclusive licensing of results to a third party established in a third country not associated to Horizon 2020. The respective option of Article 30.3 of the Model Grant Agreement will be applied.
Under this call topic, the beneficiaries nominated as project coordinators cannot, in this capacity, be awarded more than one grant from the European Union budget. In case an applicant organisation appears as coordinator in more than one proposal, only the last submitted proposal will be considered for evaluation. This approach should allow different governance models to be tested through this topic and provide a wide range of complementary outcomes, including lessons learnt, for the future set-up.
Expected Impact:
Cybersecurity solutions, products or services for the identified critical challenges, increasing the cybersecurity of the Digital Single Market , in particular for sectors from which stakeholders are involved;
A feasible, sustainable governance model for the Cybersecurity Competence Network developed and tested through successful pilot projects addressing selected industrial challenges;
Clearly demonstrated strengthening of Member States' research and innovation competence and cybersecurity capacities, also within their national cybersecurity ecosystems, to meet the increasing cybersecurity challenges;
Synergies between experts from various cybersecurity domains demonstrated;
Bridges built between the network and industrial communities;
Research and Development programme with a common Research and Innovation Roadmap reflecting all different cybersecurity sectors and covering a wide range of activities from research to testing;
A cybersecurity skills framework model developed, which can be used as a reference by education providers to develop appropriate curricula; by employers, to help assess their cybersecurity workforce, and improve job descriptions; by citizens to reskill themselves;
Establishment of foundations for pooling and streamlining the development and deployment of cybersecurity technology and strengthening industrial capabilities to secure EU's digital economy, society, democracy, space and infrastructures.

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Europe's economic activities and Europe's single market is dependent on well-functioning underlying digital infrastructures, services and data integrity, not the least for critical infrastructures like energy, transport, health, finance, etc. Current security of the digital infrastructures and services will soon be under threat of no longer providing long-term security. Confidentiality of data and communications, authentication, as well as the long-term integrity of stored data have to be guaranteed, even in the advent of quantum computers. Introducing Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) in the underlying infrastructure has the potential to maintain end-to-end security in the long-term.
Scope:
Building an experimental platform to test and validate the concept of end-to-end security, providing quantum key distribution as a service. Proposals should develop an open, robust, reliable and fully monitored metropolitan area testbed network (ring or mesh configuration). The aim is to integrate equipment, components, protocols and network technologies with QKD systems and current digital security and communication networks. Where necessary, R&D activities can be addressed. The testbed should be modular, to test different components, configurations and approaches from multiple suppliers and benchmark the different approaches against overall performance. The proposed solutions should demonstrate resistance against known hacking techniques, including quantum hacking techniques. The testbed should make use as much as possible of existing network infrastructure (fibres and/or satellites), provide a quantum key exchange rate compatible with concrete application requirements over metropolitan distances (i.e. of at least 40km). The proposed testbed should demonstrate different applications and use cases of QKD (including for authentication), optimizing end-to-end security rather than the security of individual elements.
Proposals should include an assessment of the applications and parts of the infrastructure for which the integration of QKD is economically justified, as well as an assessment of the minimal acceptable key rate for each application and its total cost of ownership.
Proposals should bring together relevant stakeholders such as telecommunication equipment manufacturers, users, network operators, QKD equipment providers, digital security professionals and scientists.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of up to EUR 15 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
For grants awarded under this topic the Commission may object to a transfer of ownership or the exclusive licensing of results to a third party established in a third country not associated to Horizon 2020. The respective option of Article 30.3 of the Model Grant Agreement will be applied.
Expected Impact:
Demonstrating the feasibility of quantum communication networks.
Validation of quantum network technologies, architectures, protocols, including broader cryptographic services based on QKD infrastructure.
Interoperability of quantum and classical networks, as well as multi-vendor interoperability.
Development of standards for QKD components, equipment and protocols.

","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Disruptions in the operation of our countries’ critical infrastructure may result from many kinds of hazards and physical and/or cyber-attacks on installations and their interconnected systems. Recent events demonstrate the increase of combined physical and cyber-attacks due to their interdependencies. A comprehensive, yet installation-specific, approach is needed to secure existing or future, public or private, connected and interdependent installations, plants and systems. Budgetary constraints on both the public and private sectors mean that new security solutions must be more accurate, efficient and cost-effective, and possibly more automated than the ones currently available.
Scope:
Proposals should cover: forecast, assessment of physical and cyber risks, prevention, detection, response, and in case of failure, mitigation of consequences (including novel installation designs), and fast recovery after incidents, over the life span of the infrastructure, with a view to achieving the security and resilience of all functions performed by the installations, and of neighbouring populations and the environment.
They should:
(a) assess in detail all aspects of interdependent physical (e.g. bombing, sabotage and attacks with a variety of weapons against installations, buildings and ships; plane or drone overflights and crashes; spreading of fires, floods, landslides, disastrous consequences of global warming, seismic activity, space weather, combined threats, etc.) and cyber threats and incidents (e.g. malfunction of SCADA system, non-authorised access of server, electronic interference, distributed attacks), and the cascading risks resulting from such complex threats,
(b) demonstrate the accuracy of their risk assessment approach using specific examples and scenarios of real life and by comparing the results with other risk assessment methodologies,
(c) develop improved real-time, evidence-based security management of physical and cyber threats, taking account of the ageing of existing infrastructure, and
(d) provide scenarios and recommendations for policy planning, engagement of the civil society, and investment measures encompassing all aspects of prevention-detection-response-mitigation
Innovative methods should be proposed for sharing information with the public in the vicinity of the installations - including through social media and with the involvement of civil society organisations -, for the protection of first responders such as rescue teams, security teams and monitoring teams, and for ensuring service continuity.
In 2018 and 2019, they should focus on any type of installation belonging to one of the following critical infrastructures: water systems, energy infrastructure (power plants and distribution, oil rigs, offshore platforms), transport infrastructure (airports, ports, railways, urban multimodal nodes), communication infrastructures and ground segments of space systems, health services, e-commerce and the postal infrastructure, sensitive industrial sites and plants, and financial services.
In 2020, while keeping the coverage of the assessment of risks, prevention, detection, response and mitigation of consequences, proposals should also address the interrelations between different types of critical infrastructure with the objective of developing tools and methods to minimise cascading effects and allow rapid recovery of service performance levels after incidents.
When selecting for funding the proposals submitted in 2018 or 2019 or 2020, the Commission will take due account of similar projects financed in the previous years since 2016, with a view to cover the largest possible spectrum of installations. Each year, a list of infrastructures excluded from the Call will be published on the Funding and Tenders Portal.
Consortia should involve the largest variety of relevant beneficiaries, including infrastructure owners and operators, first responders, industry, technologists and social scientists, etc. The participation of SMEs is strongly encouraged.

Disruptions in the operation of our countries’ critical infrastructure may result from many kinds of hazards and physical and/or cyber-attacks on installations and their interconnected systems. Recent events demonstrate the increase of combined physical and cyber-attacks due to their interdependencies. A comprehensive, yet installation-specific, approach is needed to secure existing or future, public or private, connected and interdependent installations, plants and systems. Budgetary constraints on both the public and private sectors mean that new security solutions must be more accurate, efficient and cost-effective, and possibly more automated than the ones currently available.
Scope:
Proposals should cover: forecast, assessment of physical and cyber risks, prevention, detection, response, and in case of failure, mitigation of consequences (including novel installation designs), and fast recovery after incidents, over the life span of the infrastructure, with a view to achieving the security and resilience of all functions performed by the installations, and of neighbouring populations and the environment.
They should:
(a) assess in detail all aspects of interdependent physical (e.g. bombing, sabotage and attacks with a variety of weapons against installations, buildings and ships; plane or drone overflights and crashes; spreading of fires, floods, landslides, disastrous consequences of global warming, seismic activity, space weather, combined threats, etc.) and cyber threats and incidents (e.g. malfunction of SCADA system, non-authorised access of server, electronic interference, distributed attacks), and the cascading risks resulting from such complex threats,
(b) demonstrate the accuracy of their risk assessment approach using specific examples and scenarios of real life and by comparing the results with other risk assessment methodologies,
(c) develop improved real-time, evidence-based security management of physical and cyber threats, taking account of the ageing of existing infrastructure, and
(d) provide scenarios and recommendations for policy planning, engagement of the civil society, and investment measures encompassing all aspects of prevention-detection-response-mitigation
Innovative methods should be proposed for sharing information with the public in the vicinity of the installations - including through social media and with the involvement of civil society organisations -, for the protection of first responders such as rescue teams, security teams and monitoring teams, and for ensuring service continuity.
In 2018 and 2019, they should focus on any type of installation belonging to one of the following critical infrastructures: water systems, energy infrastructure (power plants and distribution, oil rigs, offshore platforms), transport infrastructure (airports, ports, railways, urban multimodal nodes), communication infrastructures and ground segments of space systems, health services, e-commerce and the postal infrastructure, sensitive industrial sites and plants, and financial services.
In 2020, while keeping the coverage of the assessment of risks, prevention, detection, response and mitigation of consequences, proposals should also address the interrelations between different types of critical infrastructure with the objective of developing tools and methods to minimise cascading effects and allow rapid recovery of service performance levels after incidents.
When selecting for funding the proposals submitted in 2018 or 2019 or 2020, the Commission will take due account of similar projects financed in the previous years since 2016, with a view to cover the largest possible spectrum of installations. Each year, a list of infrastructures excluded from the Call will be published on the Funding and Tenders Portal.
Consortia should involve the largest variety of relevant beneficiaries, including infrastructure owners and operators, first responders, industry, technologists and social scientists, etc. The participation of SMEs is strongly encouraged.

","05 November 2019
","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
The combination of cheaper technology and new investors led by the internet sector is lowering the threshold for access to space. The number of space actors, public and private, is increasing, and with them comes the development of new space technologies and markets (such as reusable launchers, mass produced small satellites, in-orbit servicing and operations, space mining, sub-orbital flights). As a result, the number of objects in orbit will likely increase dramatically in the near future as well as new types of activities are emerging raising concerns for launcher operations, safe access to and operations in space and long-term sustainability of space.
To cope with this evolution, those future space operations from the Newspace may require new technical guidelines or new best practices for “Space Traffic Management” (STM) in order to preserve the space environment. This evolution is currently taking place in the US with the expected involvement of the Department of Commerce on space safety. Europe must be an actor of this change in order to maintain its autonomy for safely accessing and using space.
Scope:
Providing networking opportunities for stakeholders from the private space sector including research entities and the public space sector (space agencies) in order to identify responsibilities and key technologies to manage the increasing number of objects reaching orbit and performing re-entry;
Assessing available and needed technologies and capabilities, best practices, standards and guidelines to develop a STM, including in terms of costs, feasibility and effectiveness, taking into account amongst others experiences from the EU SST and EU SSA, ESA-Cleanspace and Cleansat Programmes as well as international developments in the context of the United Nations (UNOOSA)
Proposing a set of STM guidelines and best practices and evaluating their organisation and impact on the operations of spacecraft for space traffic management.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of EUR 1.50 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Proposals under this topic may be subject to security scrutiny if they could potentially lead to security-sensitive results that should be classified (see guide for classification available at the Funding & Tenders Portal).
Expected Impact:
A comprehensive overview of technical challenges to be addressed in terms of guidelines and best practices;
A description of the possible roles of current institutional and industrial actors;
An assessment of the paths for the SSA evolution to support safe and sustainable space operations;
An identification of the benefits for the EU space market development, for European sovereignty as well as for international cooperation."

Commonly occurring space weather events have the potential to impact the performance of critical space and ground infrastructure disrupting operations and communications in multiple sectors of society. Extreme events could have devastating societal and economic consequences with potential costs for disruptions and damages estimated in tens or even hundreds of billions of Euros.
Space weather must be monitored and forecasted just like terrestrial weather. However, current space weather services are generally not capable of forecasting events over several days. A longer forecasting horizon would require access to data from new observation infrastructure coupled with new and improved modelling capabilities. Preparations are underway for future instruments to be placed in suitable vantage points (Lagrange 1 and 5 as well as on Earth orbiting satellites and on ground). The challenge is to prepare for a full exploitation of such data by a renewed effort on modelling and forecasting using currently available data.
The Space Strategy recognises that growing threats emerge in space from space debris to the impact of space weather. Accordingly, the Commission announced that its intention to address threats and vulnerabilities including the impact of space weather on satellites and on ground infrastructure such as transport, energy grids and telecommunication networks.
Scope:
Proposals shall address the development of modelling capabilities and/or the delivery of prototype services able to interpret a broad range of observations of the Sun’s corona and magnetic field, of the Sun-Earth interplanetary space and of the Earth magnetosphere/ionosphere coupling relying on existing observation capacities.
The goal is to pave the way for forecasting horizons for space weather events in the order of tens of hours or days and to identify potential indicators (or proxies) of extreme events potentially through the joint analysis of interdisciplinary data.
Proposals shall address application domains which may include space as well as terrestrial infrastructure.
Proposals shall include architectural concepts of possible European space weather services in relation to the application domains addressed and they shall demonstrate complementary to and, if relevant, utilize precursor Space Weather services already available through the Space Situational Awareness programme of ESA[1] and take into account the global space weather service developments by the World Meteorological Organisation (WMO).
This action is also open to cooperation with international partners with relevant expertise.
Participation of industry, in particular SMEs, is encouraged, as well as the involvement of post-graduate scientists, engineers and researchers, for example through professional work experience or through fellowships/scholarships as applicable. A guidance document will be published together with this work programme.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 2 and 3 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.

","Research and Innovation action
","16 October 2018
","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
It is fundamental to improve our understanding of Near-Earth Objects (NEOs) through scientific modelling as well as the development of spacecraft instruments and data exploitation, both for the design of asteroids impact mitigation missions and the assessment of the associated effects.
In addition, in order to conduct spacecraft close proximity operations to NEOs and undertake mitigation demonstration missions, it is necessary to have a number of specific technologies and instruments readily available to conduct missions to asteroids with very weak gravitational fields.
The selection of NEO targets for space missions, either for science or mitigation, must guarantee both technical feasibility and high scientific/mitigation return. In this respect ground-based observations represent an essential means to investigate the physical and dynamical properties of the NEO population as a whole, thus leading to further strengthening the science return of a mission, as well as optimising the choice of mission targets. At present our knowledge of the physical characteristics of the NEO population is only around 20%.
New technologies, such as wide-field high-sensitivity telescopes, will provide in the near future the possibility to detect with enough warning time (from hours to days) the so-called ""imminent impactors"", i.e. asteroids discovered while in route of collision with the Earth. The vast majority are objects of a few meters in size which are likely to eventually produce meteorites. Performing a physical characterization of these objects before they enter the Earth's atmosphere would provide data needed for calibrating the models used to determine the physical characteristics of the NEO population from ground observational data. The capability to network large telescopes, as well as radar facilities, with such wide-field assets will be key for such physical characterization.
Scope:
The aim of this topic is the maturation or adaptation to specific use case of existing modelling capabilities and the development of technologies and instruments in support of missions to asteroids.
Each proposal shall address one or two of the following three sub-topics:
a) Maturation or adaptation to specific use cases of existing modelling capabilities.
These include the modelling of the outcome of a kinetic impactor as a function of assumed physical properties, and the implementation of benchmarking campaigns for the cross-validation of the different impact numerical models. The modelling of the dynamical and physical states of a target NEO (including binary asteroids) and their changes due to the effects of a kinetic impactor, should also be addressed, as well as modelling and testing geophysical surface and regolith processes in the low-gravity regimes of NEOs (this includes also thermal processes and surface composition characteristics).
b) Development of instruments, technologies and associated data exploitation models in support of missions to asteroids.
Payload developments are necessary to increase the knowledge of asteroid physical properties directly influencing the efficiency of a kinetic impactor deflection mission. These should include specific focus on the sub-surface and interior structure, as well as the surface mechanical properties via direct and indirect measurement techniques (such as the response of a surface to the interaction with a lander). Focus should be placed on high-accuracy shape models, surface topography and features, including the impact crater of a kinetic impactor and its surroundings.
Maximum exploitation of scientific and technical data shall be ensured by developing all the necessary algorithms and simulators to be prepared for close-proximity operations and payload data analyses (e.g. shape reconstruction from multiple data sources, performance simulators for radioscience, etc.). Specific focus shall be placed on the conditions required by payload instruments to fulfill the mission objectives.
c) Improvement of our knowledge of the physical characteristics of the NEO population.
Focus is on fostering the physical characterization of NEOs by:
1) the efficient use and pooling of existing large aperture telescopes, radar facilities and data processing capabilities; 2) performing high-quality physical observations and calculation; 3) developing methods for rapid estimation of the orbit of an object and characterization of its physical and dynamical properties; and 4) fostering international collaboration focused on timely follow-up observations of potentially hazardous objects (PHOs).
The proposed project shall coordinate with existing surveys devoted to NEO discovery and radar facilities in order to provide a rapid response system for quickly characterize a small asteroid flying-by or in route of collision with the Earth (imminent impactor).
For all aforementioned sub-topics, proposals shall seek complementarity and synergy with related European initiatives or international coordination efforts such as those undertaken by ESA or in the framework of the UN.
The involvement of post-graduate scientists, engineers and researchers is encouraged, for example through professional work experience or through fellowships/scholarships as applicable.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 2 and 4 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
This topic contributes to the Horizon 2020 focus area ""Boosting the effectiveness of the Security Union "".
Expected Impact:
Advance our understanding of the dynamical and physical states of a target NEO and their changes due to the effects of a kinetic impactor;
Advance payload technology, and the associated performance simulators for the thorough characterization of asteroid properties affecting planetary defence missions;
Advance the capability of timely detection and characterization of potential imminent impactors of Earth."

","17 December 2014","Scope:
Specific challenge: To engage small and medium enterprises in space research and development, especially those not traditionally involved in it and reduce as much as possible the entry barriers to SMEs for Horizon 2020 funding.
The specific challenge of the actions envisaged under this call could cover any aspect of the Specific Programme for Space (Horizon 2020 Framework programme and Specific programme). However, it is considered that actions in the areas of applications, especially in connection to the flagship programmes Galileo and Copernicus, spinning-in (i.e. application of terrestrial solutions to challenges in space) and the development of certain critical technologies could be adequately suited for this call.
Scope: The SME instrument consists of three separate phases and a coaching and mentoring service for beneficiaries. Participants can apply to phase 1 with a view to applying to phase 2 at a later date, or directly to phase 2.
In phase 1, a feasibility study shall be developed verifying the technological/practical as well as economic viability of an innovation idea/concept with considerable novelty to the industry sector in which it is presented (new products, processes, design, services and technologies or new market applications of existing technologies). The activities could, for example, comprise risk assessment, market study, user involvement, Intellectual Property (IP) management, innovation strategy development, partner search, feasibility of concept and the like to establish a solid high-potential innovation proposal aligned to the enterprise strategy and with a European dimension. Bottlenecks in the ability to increase profitability of the enterprise through innovation shall be detected and analysed during phase 1 and addressed during phase 2 to increase the return in investment in innovation activities.
The proposal should contain an initial business plan based on the proposed idea/concept.
The proposal should give the specifications of the elaborated business plan, which is to be the outcome of the proposal and the criteria for success.
Funding will be provided in the form of a lump sum of EUR 50.000. Proposals should last around 6 months.
In phase 2, innovation proposals will be supported that address the challenges identified in the specific programme for space and that demonstrate high potential in terms of company competitiveness and growth underpinned by a strategic business plan. Activities should focus on innovation activities such as demonstration, testing, prototyping, piloting, scaling-up, miniaturisation, design, market replication and the like aiming to bring an innovation idea (product, process, service, etc) to industrial readiness and maturity for market introduction close to deployment and market introduction, but may also include some research. For technological innovation a Technology Readiness Levels of 6 or above (or similar for non-technological innovations) are envisaged; please see part G of the General Annexes.
Proposals shall be based on an elaborated business plan either developed through phase 1 or another means. Particular attention must be paid to IP protection and ownership; applicants will have to present convincing measures to ensure the possibility of commercial exploitation ('freedom to operate').
Proposals shall contain a specification for the outcome of the proposal, including a first commercialisation plan, and criteria for success.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 0.5 and 2.5 million would allow phase 2 to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts. Proposals should last between 12 and 24 months.
In addition, in phase 3, SMEs can benefit from indirect support measures and services as well as access to the financial facilities supported under Access to Risk Finance of this work programme.
Successful beneficiaries will be offered coaching and mentoring support during phase 1 and phase 2. This service will be accessible via the Enterprise Europe Network and delivered by a dedicated coach through consultation and signposting to the beneficiaries. The coaches will be recruited from a central database managed by the Commission and have all fulfilled stringent criteria with regards to business experience and competencies. Throughout the three phases of the instrument, the Network will complement the coaching support by providing access to its innovation and internationalisation service offering. This could include, for example, depending on the need of the SME, support in identifying growth potential, developing a growth plan and maximising it through internationalisation; strengthening the leadership and management skills of individuals in the senior management team and developing in-house coaching capacity; developing a marketing strategy or raising external finance.
Expected impact:

Specific challenge: To engage small and medium enterprises in space research and development, especially those not traditionally involved in it and reduce as much as possible the entry barriers to SMEs for Horizon 2020 funding.
The specific challenge of the actions envisaged under this call could cover any aspect of the Specific Programme for Space (Horizon 2020 Framework programme and Specific programme). However, it is considered that actions in the areas of applications, especially in connection to the flagship programmes Galileo and Copernicus, spinning-in (i.e. application of terrestrial solutions to challenges in space) and the development of certain critical technologies could be adequately suited for this call.
Scope: The SME instrument consists of three separate phases and a coaching and mentoring service for beneficiaries. Participants can apply to phase 1 with a view to applying to phase 2 at a later date, or directly to phase 2.
In phase 1, a feasibility study shall be developed verifying the technological/practical as well as economic viability of an innovation idea/concept with considerable novelty to the industry sector in which it is presented (new products, processes, design, services and technologies or new market applications of existing technologies). The activities could, for example, comprise risk assessment, market study, user involvement, Intellectual Property (IP) management, innovation strategy development, partner search, feasibility of concept and the like to establish a solid high-potential innovation proposal aligned to the enterprise strategy and with a European dimension. Bottlenecks in the ability to increase profitability of the enterprise through innovation shall be detected and analysed during phase 1 and addressed during phase 2 to increase the return in investment in innovation activities.
The proposal should contain an initial business plan based on the proposed idea/concept.
The proposal should give the specifications of the elaborated business plan, which is to be the outcome of the proposal and the criteria for success.
Funding will be provided in the form of a lump sum of EUR 50.000. Proposals should last around 6 months.
In phase 2, innovation proposals will be supported that address the challenges identified in the specific programme for space and that demonstrate high potential in terms of company competitiveness and growth underpinned by a strategic business plan. Activities should focus on innovation activities such as demonstration, testing, prototyping, piloting, scaling-up, miniaturisation, design, market replication and the like aiming to bring an innovation idea (product, process, service, etc) to industrial readiness and maturity for market introduction close to deployment and market introduction, but may also include some research. For technological innovation a Technology Readiness Levels of 6 or above (or similar for non-technological innovations) are envisaged; please see part G of the General Annexes.
Proposals shall be based on an elaborated business plan either developed through phase 1 or another means. Particular attention must be paid to IP protection and ownership; applicants will have to present convincing measures to ensure the possibility of commercial exploitation ('freedom to operate').
Proposals shall contain a specification for the outcome of the proposal, including a first commercialisation plan, and criteria for success.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 0.5 and 2.5 million would allow phase 2 to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts. Proposals should last between 12 and 24 months.
In addition, in phase 3, SMEs can benefit from indirect support measures and services as well as access to the financial facilities supported under Access to Risk Finance of this work programme.
Successful beneficiaries will be offered coaching and mentoring support during phase 1 and phase 2. This service will be accessible via the Enterprise Europe Network and delivered by a dedicated coach through consultation and signposting to the beneficiaries. The coaches will be recruited from a central database managed by the Commission and have all fulfilled stringent criteria with regards to business experience and competencies. Throughout the three phases of the instrument, the Network will complement the coaching support by providing access to its innovation and internationalisation service offering. This could include, for example, depending on the need of the SME, support in identifying growth potential, developing a growth plan and maximising it through internationalisation; strengthening the leadership and management skills of individuals in the senior management team and developing in-house coaching capacity; developing a marketing strategy or raising external finance.

Deadline date","Scope:
Specific Challenge: Keeping aircraft separated from each other is one of the core functions of ATM. In the SESAR concept, ground automation supports air traffic controllers in their task to provide separation management. Separation management starts by strategically limiting the density of potential separation conflicts (i.e. limiting complexity), but is ultimately ensured tactically by keeping aircraft separated at or above defined separation minima. The use of accurate and timely trajectory information in support of automation tools allows more effective strategic separation management; however the separation standards themselves, which ultimately limit capacity, remain unchanged.
The exploratory research challenge is to define potential new separation standards and separation management techniques that will allow aircraft to be more closely spaced. Any newly proposed separation scheme needs to be assessed against the risk of collisions and the probability of disruptive wake vortex encounters.
Scope: Exploratory Research projects should investigate the overall principle of separation management in ATM and propose innovative and adapted separation schemes, both in terms of the definition of separation minima and the mechanism for assuring separation. Collision and wake-encounter risk assessments should be done in support of any proposed changes to the minima, though it should be noted this subject is not addressing collision avoidance itself. Assessments should also be made investigating the risk of infringement of any revised minima where aircraft are now spaced more closely together. Specific areas for investigation could include the following:
The use of Time-Based Separation (TBS) on final approach has already been validated in SESAR. In headwind conditions TBS are lower than Distance Based Separation (DBS) thus maintaining capacity that would otherwise be reduced. At higher altitudes, winds are usually stronger, which may result in a bigger difference between TBS and DBS than in final approach. Exploratory research projects may analyse the potential use and benefits of TBS in environments other than final approach.
The speed at which aircraft fly in the TMA is usually slower than en-route. Minimum Radar Separation (MRS) is usually 3NM in the TMA and 5NM in en-route environments, however, this difference is not directly related to the speed at which aircraft fly (i.e. the 5NM minimum is applied in en-route regardless of aircraft speed). The principle of discriminating between aircraft flying at different speeds, in order to investigate if new speed-based separation minima would be safe for aircraft that fly slower could be assessed. Unlike TBS, these newly-defined speed-based minima would be applicable under all wind conditions.
Separation minima currently in use are defined either as a lateral or as a vertical minimum. Exploratory research projects may investigate the possibility of defining separation minima that combine lateral and vertical minima. Combined separation minima would specify lateral and vertical separation minima that are individually below the existing vertical and lateral minima, but when attained simultaneously still achieve safe separation between aircraft (e.g. 1 NM and 500 feet).
Historically radar surveillance performance was the basis for the definition of separation minima. New surveillance technologies may enable a revision of such minima based on surveillance performance. Exploratory research projects may look into the possibility to define lower separation minima based on the actual surveillance performance which could be achieved through any combination of radar, ADS-B and Wide-Area Multilateration
The concept of Performance Based Navigation (PBN) brings with it the capability of clearly defined and predictable navigation performance. Projects may investigate the contribution that PBN and the associated navigation applications, specifications and technologies could make to the revision of separation minima.
Expected impact:
Reduced separation minima will allow for an increase of airspace capacity, which is one of the key objectives of SESAR.

Deadline date","Scope:
Specific challenge: Communication, navigation and surveillance (CNS) systems are the building blocks on which air traffic management operates. Despite many activities in the CNS domain there remain a number of areas where more fundamental research is needed.
The use, or adaptation, of new technologies being developed outside ATM to support ATM CNS needs should be considered including analysis of the safety, performance and security implications for the ATM system. Technology lead times in ATM along with certification requirements should be taken into account. More flexible system architectures for ground and airborne systems should be considered in this context (eg building on integrated modular avionics and an open interface approach to ground system development) to help unlock us from legacy technologies. Research projects are expected to perform an assessment of the benefits and risks from an integrated CNS infrastructure in particular with regard to redundancy and performance needs.
Scope: The full range of research that could be covered in this topic is broad and topics mentioned here are indicative. Projects may target implementation in the mid-term or could address timeframes up to those of the Flightpath 2050 vision document.
Many aspects of CNS are currently characterised by lack of integration: multiple technologies are used where it could be possible to merge into one, both within and across domains. This has the potential to generate substantial cost savings and efficiencies and, crucially, improvements in security. Studies could address the integration, interoperability and openness of such an approach for the long term, exploiting synergies, reducing costs and optimising spectrum usage. Furthermore, spectrum is a limited natural resource and increasing demands are putting aviation under pressure. Research could show how the industry can move towards a more spectrum-efficient approach to CNS with a holistic view of the full life-cycle.
In the communications domain future innovative data-link technologies (e.g. high-bandwidth) for ATM going well beyond current ATM developments and taking into account research and development outside ATM should be studied. This should include technology options suitable for the airport domain, continental airspace and oceanic and remote areas (including high latitudes and polar region).  Research proposals are expected to address the research issues related to resistance/prevention to jamming and spoofing.
In the navigation domain innovative research ideas, concepts and technologies for small aircraft are need, as a suitable back-up/continuity system for GNSS (e.g. affordable inertial systems and use of ‘other’ signals (signals of opportunity) for navigation integrity. The options for advanced alternative PNT systems should also be considered. Furthermore the transition from barometric to geometric (GPS) altitude for collision avoidance issues can be studied. In addition the re-examination of both vertical and horizontal separation practices are needed in the light of improved navigation accuracy (better than declared RNP performance).
In surveillance domain research projects can address the Surveillance Performance analysis and Quality of Services (QoS) leading to a “performance based surveillance” approach that facilitates adoption of new technologies. Furthermore, research ideas are needed in the assessment of future role of non-cooperative technologies with global coverage (e.g. satellite-based, etc.) for ATM.
Expected impact: This research will demonstrate and quantify the potential for CNS developments to improve the efficiency and performance of the ATM system at many levels.
Successful research in this topic will have the potential to generate high positive benefits for ATM in terms of resource efficient and fit-for-purpose CNS capabilities as well as improvements in security.

","24 March 2015
","single-stage
Deadline date","Scope:
Specific challenge: Trajectory Based Operations (TBO) is a key element of future ATM operating concepts. It is expected to provide the flexibility needed by airspace users to optimise their operations while simultaneously ensuring the predictability needed at ATM network level for maximum overall performance. TBO starts with pre-departure planning and continues through to real-time air traffic control. One of its foundations is improved trajectory information sharing so it defines an approach for coordinating trajectory changes and constraints. It also sets forth the extent to which trajectory adherence is required to support the specific functions of the layered planning approach upon which the ATM network is built.
Scope: Research is needed to explore a number of fundamental questions related to TBO. A framework is required that can model a system combining trajectories emanating from multiple and diverse airline users and feeding into the different ATM functions at different layers in the network. In this way it should be possible to establish a theoretical optimum and to determine the sensitivity of the system to variations and perturbations. While it may be relatively straightforward to identify an optimum for a single airline (prioritisation based on inter-flight constraints, airframe dependencies, crew and so on) the combined system-wide view is far less obvious and highly complex, especially taking into account different degrees of collaboration or, in the real world, competition between airlines.
In developing the theoretical framework the challenge of defining an approach that can lead to the best outcome in practice should also be kept in mind. To what extent can a solution be constructed from pre-agreed criteria, when and to what extent does it require active coordination between the various stakeholders? How much should the system be automated taking into account requirements for resilience, what kind of algorithms should be implemented? How much predictability is needed to make the system work and what are the expected benefits from it?
Projects will find solutions that balance flexibility and the requirement for trajectory conformance. They must consider convergence and stability, analysis of non-linear phenomena in multi-user real-time communications, emergent behaviour and non-determinism, as well as error propagation. The chosen approach must allow convergence to a stable and robust set of trajectories, taking into account inherent uncertainties in all parts of the ATM system. Projects may further investigate the extent to which flexibility is desirable by comparing system-wide and airline-specific performance that can be achieved relative to a system that requires rigid conformance with pre-planned trajectories.
It is anticipated that research in this topic will emphasise modelling approaches rather than real-time human-in-the-loop simulation.
Expected impact: TBO is a key part of future concepts (SESAR, NextGen, ICAO). It is therefore essential to fully understand the benefits and limitations of the approach. This is particularly true since the technology needed to support TBO could be extremely costly. A clear understanding of the real benefits and operational application of TBO techniques can help direct further research in this area.

The challenge is to develop a European technologically non-dependent solution for launching light satellites[1]
into Low-Earth Orbit (LEO), which will enable dedicated low-cost launches with committed schedule and orbit.
The solution needs to be innovative, implementable, affordable in development and exploitation phases, and commercially viable. Applicants are required to take a holistic approach and produce results that move beyond (but are complementary to) existing solutions. Moreover, the solution will enhance on European access to space and associated technological non-dependence and thereby will provide strategic and competitive advantages for European companies, SMEs, universities, and research organisations.
Space technologies, data and services have become indispensable to the daily lives of European citizens. Moreover, development of space technology boosts jobs, growth, and investments in Europe and strengthens its role in the world. Space solutions can help Europe to respond better to new global and societal challenges: climate change, disaster management, security threats, migration, farming, transport, energy, and many more.
While Europe has a world-class space sector, innovation in space and changing demands are leading to an increased appearance of light and agile satellites. Consequently, space solutions will increasingly consider this trend. Small satellites are well-suited for most kinds of institutional and commercial use: wireless communications networks, Internet services, broader connectivity, scientific observation, data gathering, Earth imaging, and positioning. In terms of size, light satellites rely on a lower mass in comparison with conventional satellites. Their production is more cost-effective due to series manufacturing, agility and flexibility in operations. However, light satellites will also lead to an exponential increase in launch needs by 2020-2025.
Launch opportunities in Europe for this type of satellites are currently being standardised through auxiliary payload or rideshare solutions on the European launcher fleet. However, according to market studies, light satellites are expected to lead to a significant increase in launch needs by 2020-2025.
An established service for regular launches dedicated to small satellites will contribute to achieve the following goals:
internal market growth in the manufacturing sector of small launchers and satellites and the downstream services sector;
European leading position in export markets globally in the field of light satellites and small launchers;
space-enabled seamless solutions for European citizens thanks to operational light satellites and small launchers.
The specific rules of the contest will be published in the fourth quarter of 2017 by the European Commission, which will directly launch and manage the contest and award the prize based on the judgement of independent experts. [2]
Expected Impact:
European low-cost access to space infrastructure and services solution dedicated to light satellites.

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Key institutions like universities and funding agencies are changing, in general and occasionally with respect to RRI issues. In calls for ‘civic universities’ or 'citizen companies' one can see RRI issues at play, without necessarily having them labelled as such.
Member States are reconsidering their science, technology and innovation policy. New actors such as regions, cities, social entrepreneurs and NGOs of various kinds are becoming important, and new forms of governance are emerging, partly bottom-up. The ‘triple helix’ of science, industry and government is expanding to a model of a ‘quadruple helix’ with a fourth strand, the public sphere. At the same time, there is the move to smart specialization, of regions and countries, as well as sectors. Clearly, it is important to support such changes within and between actors and stakeholders when they help articulate good practices.
Scope:
The present topic focuses on the importance of new constellations of actors, already visible in public-private partnerships and open science and open innovation, but now becoming broader and more heterogeneous. This is both about new constellations of existing actors (as in public-private interactions) and new or modified constellations because of new actors joining in. The proposals will be initiated by consortia of relevant existing and new actors (research organizations, industry, civil society organizations, and policy makers), articulating evolving practices against the overall backdrop of transformations and tensions as underlined above. There will be a reflective aspect as well, in mapping and analysing what is happening, and perhaps placing it in larger economic frameworks. The reflection is an essential complement to the interactions between the various relevant organizations and actors, in terms of exchanges about good practices and exploring new collaborations.
The proposals would require specific attention to RRI issues, but not necessarily be limited to it.
Given the variety of interests and possible tensions, a somewhat independent actor might lead the project, as some of these independent actors have actually already shown an interest and are engaged in RRI. One generally acknowledged way of managing conflict and nurturing trust is via “boundary organisations” that act as brokers or mediators between science and society with credibility in the eyes of both.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 3 million and 3.55 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
This action allows for the provision of financial support to third parties in line with the conditions set out in Part K of the General Annexes.
Expected Impact:
The proposed action is expected to enable diversification of constellations of actors and stakeholders in Research and Innovation processes, a spread of good practices among them, and a transformation in their governance framework.

Institutional changes are required to respond to the increased interactions between R&I stakeholders in society. Through institutional changes, research funding and performing organisations become more “porous” and accept inputs from citizens and organisations that used to be considered outsiders to the world of R&I. Examples include citizen science, extended peer review in funding agencies, co-creation of public policies, agenda setting in research and innovation programmes, co-production of research and innovation content, and co-evaluation of proposals, activities or other R&I funding decisions.
Good practices are widespread in Europe in terms of:
Citizens' and citizens' associations engagement in science;
Formal and informal science education;
Gender equality in science;
Research ethics and integrity;
Open access to research results.
The good practices in these five fields are much more easily, efficiently and sustainably implemented when the organisations funding, performing or associated to R&I have adapted significantly their governance frameworks to open up through a process of institutional change.
Scope:
Consortia are expected to implement institutional changes in at least one but preferably all five fields listed above as part of an integrated approach. All scientific disciplines are covered. Consortia members should aim to ensure that the institutional changes are sustainable beyond the lifetime of the project funding.
The action is addressed at organisations funding or performing activities in the field of R&I as one of their significant objectives or activities. All parts of the ""quadruple helix"" model, which sees close co-operation between industry, government, universities and society (e.g. citizens and Civil Society Organisations) in R&I, are addressed – and it is encouraged that consortia ensure truly engaged roles for all organisation types. Consortia should be composed of organisations that already have some experience of processes of institutional change and beginners, so as to encourage mutual learning. In addition, priority should be given to the development of new partnerships.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU in the order of €1.50 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
Results should contribute to a greater involvement of all stakeholders in R&I, and a better and more sustainable engagement with citizens and society as a whole. Consortia are expected to contribute to one or more of the MoRRI indicators, in particular GOV2 & GOV3[1], and to the Sustainable Development Goals (for instance goals 4, 5, 9, 12, 16 or 17)[2]. Consortia are expected to evaluate their activities and provide evidence of societal, democratic, economic and scientific impacts of institutional changes. The expected number of institutional changes, including their quality and sustainability in partner organisations, will be taken into account in evaluation. As such, it is expected that the topic will support a significant number of impactful and sustainable institutional changes in partner organisations.

Open Science describes the on-going transitions in the way research is performed, researchers collaborate, knowledge is shared, and science is organised. It is driven by digital technologies, the globalisation of the scientific community, and the need to address grand societal challenges.
The acceptance of Open Science practices varies from one discipline to another and not all researchers have the same skills to adapt to this change.
In order to address this skills gap specific training for researchers and academics addressing key skills fostering the culture of Open Science will be supported.
Scope:
While some aspects of open science, such as open access to publications, have become more widely known in recent years, significant knowledge gaps with regard to other aspects of open science still exist in both institutional settings and among individual researchers . Therefore, this topic supports actions with a clear European added value that are aimed at developing, improving or consolidating training activities at downstream level and reach the highest number of stakeholders in the European Research Area.
Actions proposed must be aimed at training stakeholders with a view to permitting them and/or their organisations to fully implement the practical aspects of open science. Stakeholders include academic staff (train the trainers approach), in particular young scientist during under- and postgraduate training, but also policy-makers and staff working in funding bodies.
The training actions proposed must be relevant for the specific scientific field, practical, engaging, and outcome-oriented .and aiming at linking up with other already existing training initiatives. They should reach the greatest number of stakeholders possible including those Horizon 2020 projects that do not participate in the Horizon 2020 Pilot on open access to data.
Online didactic material or training tool kits made available free of charge/open access for re-use must be developed and linked with existing online material.
As Open Science impacts the entire research cycle and its organisation introducing Open Science research practices education and training will be supported.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of the order of EUR 900 000 would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
This action allows for the provision of financial support to third parties in line with the conditions set out in Part K of the General Annexes.
Expected Impact:
This action will increase knowledge of open science related issues across different disciplines, contribute to changes in behaviour that are consistent with the ideals underlying Open Science, and prepare stakeholders for a real application of Open Science in the European Research Area, in particular in Horizon 2020.

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
There is already experience with RRI issues in industry, for example in connection with Nanoscience and Nanotechnologies. Now that other domains are drawing public attention (e.g. synthetic biology, geo-engineering), the challenge is to take stock, drawing also on existing analyses, and to progress further in integrating RRI in industrial contexts.
Earlier and present activities initiated and carried by RRI 'champions' in industrial sectors can be a starting point. The early Responsible Care Programme of the chemical industry and various attempts at codes of conduct for Nano science and Nanotechnologies are quite well-known examples, as are various initiatives referring to sustainability, but one should not overlook smaller and less visible examples. There are also broad-brush initiatives related to social responsibility of organizations and sustainability (e.g. Vision 2050[1]) and which want to pay attention, explicitly or implicitly, to RRI (e.g. EIRMA Task Force on Responsible Innovation). There are the activities which go further than Corporate Social Responsibility, because they are linked to technological innovations.
There are various motives and drivers in these developments, including the importance of having or keeping a social licence to operate, i.e. an acceptance from various stakeholders and communities as a prerequisite to operations. Nevertheless, because of the variety of values and societal convictions, there will be no consensus about who or what is going to count as ‘responsible’. This constitutes a structural problem, not only because of essential contestations in our societies, but also because what is 'responsible' can be interpreted differently by different actors, while each of them wants to use it to describe how he is doing the right thing. The narrative of ‘inclusion’ compounds this problem.
Scope:
Two considerations are important within the scope of this topic. First, the narrative of ‘inclusion’, also implicitly in the way terms like ‘inclusive’ are used, suggests that more actors and more inputs should be included in the work of traditional organisations. These organisations might feel beleaguered, and be reluctant. Proposals to do better often start with suggestions on how to create more access for societal actors to the ‘beleaguered’ organisations, which reinforces the storyline. Second, to reduce the effect of mutual suspicions about intentions, the proposals should create (and be themselves) a space guided by actors (or a combination of actors) who would themselves be above the struggles of suspicion and the deadlocks these create. The participants in the project will be mostly companies and industry organisations, but can also include other entities, e.g. private foundations and/or so-called third parties like organisations specialized in supporting changes toward responsible innovation or re-insurance companies. It is expected that several companies join forces to experiment new ways of developing their research and innovation activities in the line of RRI.
To address this specific challenge, proposals should have a wide geographical coverage. It is therefore expected that consortia would include at least entities from 10 different Member States or Associated Countries, although smaller consortia will also be eligible and may be selected.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 3 million and 3.55 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
This action allows for the provision of financial support to third parties in line with the conditions set out in Part K of the General Annexes.
Expected Impact:
This action aims at the development of new approaches to innovation (be they technical, social or otherwise) in industrial context. It will use and improve existing training instruments funded by the European Commission (e.g. RRI-TOOLKIT of the project RRI-TOOLS[2]). It will help disseminate good RRI practices in industrial circles.

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
The Science4Refugees initiative is directed towards researchers/scientists with refugee background, which will enable them to continue their educational path or enter the European research labour market. Under the header ""Science4Refugees"", as part of the EURAXESS initiative, the integration into the European researchers' community as part of the labour force shall be enhanced.
Information available on education level of recently arrived refugees and asylum seekers points to a rather wide distribution across education level. To integrate them into Europe's research system, specific measures are requested in terms of integrating the highly skilled refugees into the labour market and to better understand the different cultural backgrounds.
The objective of the call is raising the awareness of refugee researchers of jobs and career development opportunities in Europe. Activities can directly address support for the job seeker but should also address the relevant skills assessment and training of the refugee researcher to increase his/her chances on a competitive European labour market. They can also comprise activities like open lectures, academic networking initiatives and training on how to reach the appropriate qualifications for the higher education system in the new country.
Scope:
This action is addressed to legal entities such as universities, NGOs, the EURAXESS Service Centres to bring involuntary immigrants with a refugee background into the European research labour market in the new host country.
Collaboration or coupling with national labour market initiatives are welcome, however the involvement of an accredited EURAXESS Centre would be beneficial for their experience in welcoming international researchers. These initiatives will give refugees researchers/scientists the opportunity to develop their knowledge and careers by improving their skills and employability.
The funded initiatives shall contribute to the overall scope of the EURAXESS initiative so that projects can be taken up and enlarged to a European level, e.g. webinars on entrepreneurship, research field specific training or any other training need will be uploaded in the relevant section of the EURAXESS portal.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU in the order of EUR 0.25 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nevertheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
Provide support for the career development of refugee researchers, both women and men, to support their integration into their new employment settings and culture, and to prepare female and male refugees for the highly competitive and highly skilled job market. In the medium term, the action aims at supporting research jobs and growth; it will increase the number of highly skilled workers who are sufficiently prepared to access the European labour market by using their newly gained skills and experience through the supported actions.

","Research and Innovation action
","12 April 2017
","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
The challenge is to model and better understand the dynamics of the complex webs of innovation value chains and the openings they offer for RRI. The key idea is that of crisscrossing 'innovation value chains'. Innovations and prototypes, business-to-business products and final products move from one organization (entity) to another and are transformed in the process, value is added in the transactions and appropriated. Third-party actors are involved such as standardization bodies and insurance companies, but also, and increasingly, NGOs. While there is a direction to the eventual product flows, initiatives may emerge anywhere, there is no simple linearity (cf. the chain-link model of innovation) and, even more, no beginning nor end (cf. circular economy). Chains can change, split, be re-arranged, crisscross, and co-evolve with changing business models. In general, industry and service structures consist of webs of crisscrossing chains, forming broader structures, consisting of more than the traditional economic actors. There are uncertainties involved in the evolution of these webs, e.g. with the promise of large-area polymeric semi-conducting materials that can be printed. Will the key driver of the eventual chains in this domain be the materials manufacturers, the printing companies, or the various application sectors?
Scope:
Given this perspective, the key point of the present topic is that there are openings for RRI in these webs of chains, building on what is there already and/or inserting it if there is an opportunity. Thus, this action shall start with the economic world rather than see RRI as only impinging on it from the outside. It draws on the theme of exploration of intermediaries and boundary spanners, but creates additional focus, as underlined here below by the questions and issues that could be addressed under this topic..
The experience with stage-gate approaches[1] in R&D and product development, as practiced within a few firms, has been taken up by some Member States as a framework for their approach to RRI, and applied in a few cases. What could be explored is whether stage-gate processes could be applied across organisations in an innovation chain, and create openings to include RRI not just in the assessments during the 'gate', but also during the 'stage', to anticipate on the eventual assessment.
When novelties (new options) are introduced, articulated and taken up, chains can shift and split (for example in additive manufacturing, and in the uses of mobile telephony) and new chains may emerge. This can just happen, but increasingly, actors try to anticipate and influence what happens to serve their interests, or otherwise pursue desirable goals. There is joint strategy articulation, occasionally supported by Constructive Technology Assessment, road mapping, and indications and narratives to monitor performance in a forward-looking manner, as in notions like technological readiness. There are openings here, for example by adding 'societal readiness' levels to technological readiness levels, and making sure that ‘societal readiness’ has pro-active elements, and is not just another term for 'societal acceptability'.
More generally, the reference to responsibility that is part of RRI is not about retrospective responsibility, as in accountability and liability, but about prospective responsibility, with its expectation, perhaps obligation, to do well. The requirement can be seen as a call ‘to show an honest effort’. This phrase has been used to assess technology forcing measures (as in the California air pollution legislation). One opening for RRI would then be to operationalise it as 'an honest effort' to achieve desirable outcomes in innovation chains and eventual product-value chains, responding to societal values.
This illustration of possible openings for RRI becoming visible through the perspective of webs of crisscrossing and shifting/emerging chains, is not exhaustive. It shows, though, that it is a generative perspective. It can also contribute to other parts of Horizon 2020. For example, questions about the role of SMEs, or of small-holder farmers, can be explored by inquiring into their functioning in present and emerging webs of crisscrossing chains. 'Open innovation' can become more than a fashionable catchword, at the same time making operational how RRI fits in.
This action will show, and induce, relevant change, without having to go through definitional exercises about RRI first, because the thrust is to go for 'openings to do better'. Rather than ‘growth’ per se, often defined in terms of competition only, the result will be higher quality outcomes and better jobs ('better technology in a better society').
To address this specific challenge, proposals should have a wide geographical coverage. It is therefore expected that consortia would include at least entities from 10 different Member States or Associated Countries, although smaller consortia will also be eligible and may be selected.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of the order of EUR 3 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
This action allows for the provision of financial support to third parties in line with the conditions set out in Part K of the General Annexes.
Expected Impact:
The development of a model and a better understanding of the webs of Innovation Value Chains will set a stronger knowledge base for policy orientations regarding innovation. This will facilitate the dissemination and integration of good RRI practices thanks to the identification of 'openings' for RRI. This action will strengthen the SWAFS knowledge base, but also promote institutional changes in Research Funding (RFO) and Research Performing Organizations (RPO), as well as in and across organisations involved in innovation and its embedding in society.

","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
In many countries in Europe and at European level the major part of the research budget is allocated in the form of grants. The allocation of grants and access to funding is consequently an essential component of scientific performance and career progression. She Figures 2015 shows that although the gender gaps in the funding success rates is decreasing at the EU level, men still have a higher success rate than women[1]. Research is needed to better understand the remaining institutional barriers which contribute to maintaining the gender gaps in research funding, as well as the policy changes required to remove such barriers.
Scope:
From selected key research and/or innovation fields, the research will situate the role of grants in researchers' careers, identify, map, and analyse the possible differences between women and men researchers at various steps of grant allocation by research funding organisations and their potential consequences on their careers. Factors that create gender biases in the grant awarding processes of research funding organisations will be investigated. The research will give particular attention to the nature and mode of action of hindering and driving factors and investigate their relative weight in the grant awarding processes of research funding organisations. It will suggest how to overcome the hindering factors and arrive at a better level playing field for women and men researchers by adapting the grant systems (institutional change approach). The research will formulate recommendations targeting research funding policy and involve different stakeholders in this process.
A project duration of at least 48 months is recommended.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of the order of EUR 2.00 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
Contribute to more gender equal research grant systems in the EU and to advancing gender equality in research and innovation as requested in the European Research Area.[2] Help EU research and innovation benefit better from male and female scientists' talents and improve the quality of research and innovation and their relevance to society.

","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Much analysis has been carried out on the importance of science education both in schools and in higher education. However, science education outside the classroom, which refers to informal science education, and the science education effects of non-educational activities, are not well explored in their nature and effects. Acquiring knowledge, and in particular, evaluating knowledge, often with the help of the Internet, is what is frequently happening in reality, and should be recognised for what it contributes in terms of more sophisticated consumers and scientific citizenship. Consideration on what is available and what is being learnt would be useful to understand how science education outside the classroom influences today's citizens.
Scope:
The available knowledge on science education outside the classroom and its impact on citizens need to be analysed, taking into account possible gender and geographical differences and the analysis including socio-economically disadvantaged groups. The analysis include socio-economically disadvantaged groups. The proposed action shall specify if this type of learning complements the classroom or succeeds where the classroom might have failed. Consideration shall be given to the impact that can be achieved by science education outside schools and how this form of informal schooling might be accredited and whether there is a way of assessing the quality of the educational contents.
To address this specific challenge, proposals should have a wide geographical coverage. It is therefore expected that consortia would include at least entities from 10 different Member States or Associated Countries, although smaller consortia will also be eligible and may be selected.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of the order of EUR 3 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
This action allows for the provision of financial support to third parties in line with the conditions set out in Part K of the General Annexes.
Expected Impact:
In the short term, the proposed action will identify good practices in terms of science education outside the classroom and consider the impact this information has on formal and informal science education for students and citizens. In the medium term, the results of the present action will help the EU to better understand the effects of science education outside the regular education institutions and will increase the range of innovative products in science education that reflect societal needs. In the long term the results of the research should contribute to considerations on accrediting the available information.

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
In its Conclusions of 1 December 2015 on advancing gender equality in the European Research Area, the Council invited the Commission and the Member States to consider including, among others, a gender perspective in dialogues with third countries in the area of science, technology and innovation (STI).
The EU Member States and many countries outside the European Union are facing similar challenges in terms of gender equality in STI: gender-related biases are leading to horizontal (disparities among different scientific disciplines) and vertical (low levels of women representation on top positions) segregation. The perception of and support for gender equality varies significantly across cultures. Cultural and institutional barriers turn women away from STI and affect their careers. Also the take up of the gender dimension in research and innovation content[1] is still limited. The EU has developed a strategy for gender equality along three objectives relating to equality in careers, gender balance in decision-making and the integration of the gender dimension in R&I content.
The Commission has pledged reinforced cooperation with third countries under one of the three goals set by the current Commissioner, i.e. Open to the World. There is increasing interest from third countries to cooperate with the EU in the field of STI and encourage the mobility of researchers. It is therefore important to develop common solutions for common challenges regarding gender inequalities in STI.
Scope:
The project will investigate how gender equality matters are taken into consideration at different levels of international cooperation in the area of science, technology and innovation between the EU and a selected set of third countries, along three objectives, i.e. equality in scientific careers, gender balance in decision making, and the integration of the gender dimension in R&I content. The project will build on the work done by the ERA-related groups in charge of gender equality and international cooperation as well as EU funded projects. It will provide a mapping and a subsequent analysis of how gender equality is taken into account and promoted:
in the formal bilateral and multilateral agreements in the STI area between the EU Member States and Associated Countries on one side and the selected third countries on the other side;
in the bilateral and multilateral STI implementation activities, including access to grants and the evaluation process;
in the dissemination and promotion of the results of international dialogues and cooperation.
The project will also formulate recommendations to enhance the integration of gender equality objectives at the various stages mentioned above.
In line with the strategy for EU international cooperation in research and innovation (COM(2012)497), international cooperation is encouraged.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of the order of EUR 2 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
Improve awareness and implementation of gender equality objectives in the bilateral and multilateral activities between EU Member States and third countries in the area of STI. Contribute to removing potential barriers to the equal treatment of women and men scientists and to integrate the gender dimension in R&I content in international dialogues and cooperation.

","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Through the implementation of Gender Equality Plans (GEPs) in the last years in research organisations and universities a substantial knowledge base and a wide set of practices were established which is accessible in particular in the Gender Equality in Academia and Research - GEAR tool[1].
Gender Equality Plans are now common in some Member States and Associated Countries, but in others they are in their infancy. The implementation of the Plans as a key instrument for gender equality in the European Research Area and the institutional change they entail in research organisations and universities need to be further promoted and evaluated.
A promising option which is implemented in some countries, could be gender equality award schemes for R&I organisations. Some awarding schemes are also used as drivers for competition in attracting students and researchers and/ or as prerequisite to access funding.
Scope:
The action will consist of a feasibility study of a European award/certification system for gender equality in research organisations, including universities. Several options should be investigated.
Based on the experiences of existing schemes and outcomes of previous research and initiatives (e.g. Horizon 2020 projects such as GEDII, and EFFORTI, FP7 ERA-Net Gender-NET[2]) , the action will:
- Conduct an in-depth qualitative and quantitative assessment of existing national award/certification schemes for gender equality in research organisations and universities. Particular attention will be given to the national context in terms of legislation, policy and research funding environment to understand the intended and non-intended impacts of each evaluated award scheme.
- Provide a clear framework for at least 3 different options of a European award/certification scheme encompassing the three objectives for gender equality in the ERA, i.e. gender equality scientific careers, gender balance in decision-making positions and in the integration of the gender dimension in R&I content. The options should take into account the possible synergies and linkages with the current Human Resources Strategy for Researchers (HRS4R).
A project duration of maximum 24 months is recommended.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of the order of EUR 1.50 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
Strengthen the incentives for research organisations and universities to set up Gender Equality Plans. Make progress on gender equality along the three objectives set in the European Research Area, i.e. in scientific careers, in decision-making and in the integration of the gender dimension in R&I content.

","11 December 2018
","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Citizen science is blooming across all scientific disciplines and the humanities. It can potentially bring a wide variety of benefits to researchers, citizens, policy makers and society across the research and innovation cycle, e.g; it can accelerate and sometimes even make possible the production of new scientific knowledge; it can help policy makers monitor implementation and compliance with regulations; it can increase public awareness about science and feeling of ownership of policies; and it can enable faster and evidence-informed reactions to events and better territorial coverage.
At the same time there are difficulties setting up citizen science initiatives – in terms of choosing the optimum methodologies; in terms of quality assurance and validation of the outcomes; in terms of linking the various governance levels, from local to global; in terms of ensuring balanced participation of citizens (e.g. regardless of background, gender and age); in terms of integrity of methods and data; in terms of recognising the work of citizens participating in citizen science initiatives; in terms of managing large numbers of volunteers for many months or even years (and keeping them motivated and responding to their questions).
Furthermore, questions remain unanswered about the potentials of citizen science for society e.g: what is the potential number of citizen scientists and who are they? What are the costs and benefits of citizen science (e.g. in terms of scientific excellence and the economy)? What relationship can and does citizen science have to informal and formal science education? Are there limits to citizen science, and if so what are they?
For the present topic citizen science should be understood broadly, covering a range of different levels of participation, from raising public knowledge of science, encouraging citizens to participate in the scientific process by observing, gathering and processing data, right up to setting scientific agenda and co-designing and implementing science-related policies. It could also involve publication of results and teaching science.
Scope:
There are the two sub-topics:
A, Coordination and Support Action - CSA (1 project in 2018): This will provide support to citizen science at the European level. It will also create a mutual learning space where citizen science projects/participants can exchange experiences and successful strategies. It will raise awareness of citizen science among the general public, provide co-ordination support between citizen science initiatives (in particular those funded by SwafS but also working in a spirit of co-operation with established networks of citizen scientists), identify training needs with a view to developing and implementing training to help citizen scientists, and support communication between citizen science and science journalists/science media. It will also identify good practices that incentivise career scientists to engage with citizen science activities.
B, Research and Innovation Actions - RIA (multiple projects in 2018-2019): This will support hands-on citizen science activities. Proposals may focus on one particular area of scientific enquiry or tackle several, though transdisciplinary approaches should be favoured. The intended activities should be clearly defined and result in the development of new knowledge, new technologies, or new means of using existing technological or social innovations better. Activities can explore how citizen science develops scientific skills and competences, act as a tool for informal and formal science education of young people and adults, counter perceived anti-intellectual attitudes in society, raise the scientific literacy of European citizens, and promote social inclusion and employability. Gender, geographical and socio-economic factors should be taken into account so as to ensure activities are open to people from all backgrounds. Effort should be made to evaluate the impacts on society, democracy, the economy, science itself, and the individual citizen scientists involved in the activities. Lines of communication should be established with other relevant SwafS projects in order to share evaluation data and data arising from the citizen science in the spirit of open science.
In line with the strategy for EU international cooperation in research and innovation (COM(2012)497), international cooperation is encouraged.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU in the order of € 2.00 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
A. Coordination and Support Action: Strengthened networks, co-ordination and communication among citizen science projects (particularly, but not limited, to those funded by SwafS). Availability of tools, guidelines, or other materials useful to actors inexperienced in organising and supporting citizen science initiatives. Increased awareness amongst the general public of citizen science. Delivery of training to citizen scientists (or potential science practitioners) and resultant increased skills, competences, and scientific excellence. Consortia should choose a basket of indicators to measure the impact of their work against. In particular, consortia are expected to contribute to one or more of the MoRRI indicators (for instance PE1 to PE10) and to the Sustainable Development Goals[1].
B. Research and Innovation Actions: Development of new knowledge and innovations by citizen scientists. Availability of evaluation data concerning the societal, democratic and economic costs and benefits of citizen science.

The area of Research Ethics and Integrity is fast evolving. In the EU and internationally, new legislation, codes and good practices are constantly being developed. In this complex environment, researchers cannot easily identify and be aware of the rules to be followed. This also constitutes a challenge for the ethics/integrity experts.
Scope:
The action aims at providing a dynamic mapping of the ethics/integrity normative framework which applies to scientific research conducted by European research teams, in the EU and beyond. The work undertaken shall primarily aim at supporting the work of researchers and ethics/integrity review committees.
The action shall design the most appropriate mapping methodology, the processes and institutions to be mapped and produce appropriate process maps, indicating the criteria/dimensions (geographic scope, thematic coverage, stakeholder involvement, etc.) and enable comparative analysis. The outcome of the mapping action shall stimulate knowledge transfer and ultimately promote the uptake of the highest ethical standards. In order to facilitate this role, English summary/abstract of the normative elements (e.g. legislation, code, etc.) focusing on the main practical requirements/recommendations should be made available.
Researchers shall also be helped to distinguish between the legislation that must be applied (highlighting the practical obligations) and the soft laws and best practices that must be taken into account (illustrating them with concrete examples) in the research design and implementation to guarantee the compatibility with the highest ethical standards.
The resulting mapping shall be made available online and include beyond the constitutive elements of the normative framework information on the available trainings and education activities as well as on where to find appropriate ethics/integrity expertise Practical information on how to comply with the legislation and standards should be provided (e.g. website relevant bodies, etc.) and regularly updated. In addition, the work must rely on a real case and scenario building approach based on existing literature, court cases etc. The mapping shall also include contact details of the ethics and research integrity committees/bodies and other relevant authorities (e.g. for personal data protection) which shall deliver the necessary approvals/authorisations. The construction and update of this online database must be done in close cooperation with the ""European Ethics and Research Integrity Network"" which is supported by Horizon 2020[1]. This cooperation shall notably ensure positive synergies and guarantee the long term continuity/sustainability of the resulting output.
In addition to the above cited network and in order to avoid duplication of work already undertaken, it is essential to ensure that the publicly available results from relevant EU funded research projects (from FP7 and Horizon 2020) are taken into account.
In line with the strategy for EU international cooperation in research and innovation (COM(2012)497), international cooperation is encouraged.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of the order of EUR 3.8 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
This action allows for the provision of financial support to third parties in line with the conditions set out in Part K of the General Annexes.
Expected Impact:
The proposed action will facilitate the work of the researchers to comply with research integrity and ethics standards and legislation while improving the effectiveness and efficiency of the research ethics/ integrity committees and competent national bodies. Consequently, the excellence of public and private research in the European Research Area will be promoted.

At the moment, Europe faces a shortfall in science-knowledgeable people at all levels of society. This is a good time to expand opportunities for science learning, in formal, non-formal and informal settings. Evidence shows that European citizens, young and old, appreciate the importance of science and want to be more informed, and that citizens want more science education. Over 40% believe science and technological innovation can have a positive impact on the environment, health and medical care, and basic infrastructure in the future. Therefore, collaboration between formal, non-formal and informal education providers, enterprises and civil society should be enhanced to ensure relevant and meaningful engagement of all societal actors with science and increase the uptake of science studies and science based careers, employability and competitiveness.
Scope:
This action aims to support a range of activities based on collaboration between formal, non-formal and informal education providers, enterprises and civil society in order to integrate the concept of open schooling, including all educational levels, in science education.
""Open schooling"" where schools, in cooperation with other stakeholders, become an agent of community well-being shall be promoted; families shall be encouraged to become real partners in school life and activities; professionals from enterprises and civil and wider society should actively be involved in bringing real-life projects to the classroom. Partnerships that foster expertise, networking, sharing and applying science and technology research findings across different enterprises (start-ups, SMEs, larger corporations) shall be promoted. Gender and geographical differences should be considered.
To address this specific challenge, proposals should have a wide geographical coverage. It is therefore expected that consortia would include at least entities from 10 different Member States or Associated Countries, although smaller consortia will also be eligible and may be selected.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of the order of EUR 3 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
This action allows for the provision of financial support to third parties in line with the conditions set out in Part K of the General Annexes.
Expected Impact:
The proposed action targets the creation of new partnerships in local communities to foster improved science education for all citizens. It is expected that in the short term the development of partnerships between schools, local communities and local industry should contribute to a more scientifically interested and literate society and students with a better awareness of and interest in scientific careers. In the medium term the activities should provide citizens and future researchers with the tools and skills to make informed decisions and choices and in the long-term this action should contribute towards the ERA objectives of increasing the numbers of scientists and researchers in Europe.

Experience shows that strategies and practices based on RRI can open up R&I to all relevant actors, and improve co-operation between science and society, fostering the recruitment of new talent, and pairing scientific excellence with social awareness and responsibility.
Territories have a specific advantage to address the complexity of the challenges set by the interplay between science and society. Indeed local actors have an intimate knowledge of the physical territorial setting, and local ecology, i.e. the status quo of the complex relationships between cultural, social, economic and political actors, of the local dynamics, history, expectations and requirements as well as specific concerns.
During the last century, local and regional development policies have slowly, unevenly, but surely, integrated dimensions related to science, technology, and innovation (STI). For example, the European Commission supported regional technology plans in the 1990s and regional innovation strategies during the 2000s. Since 2010 the Commission has encouraged regions to develop smart specialisation strategies, based on comprehensive stakeholder involvement, to identify specific fields of industrial and research strengths with a potential for competitive advantages for the region[1]. A more comprehensive approach involving citizens and communities is likely to result in positive impacts on STI and local and regional development.
Territories can work towards the establishment of self-sustaining R&I ecosystems that are characterised by a high degree of openness, democratic accountability, and responsiveness to need by taking action to promote all parts of RRI (i.e. gender equality, science education, open access/open data, public engagement, and ethics). This requires them to bring relevant quadruple helix R&I actors together, for instance citizens and civil society organisations (CSOs), universities, research institutions, formal and informal education institutions (including primary and secondary schools), governments and public authorities (including regional and local administrations and science policy institutions), businesses (including industry, the service sector and social entrepreneurs) and science mediators. New R&I working methods within and between organisations, including novel and transparent governance relations, would promote greater sustainability and inclusiveness at local, national, EU and global levels.
Scope:
For the present topic, 'territory' should be understood broadly. Territories may be defined by any particular area characterised by certain geographical features, or any area with shared cultural, environmental or economic ties.
Consortia should focus activities in more than one territory in Europe (and possibly also in Third Countries), with a view to developing and promoting shared learning and diffusion of governance innovations. Local and regional authorities should be active partners of the consortia, in particular those institutions or parts of institutions responsible for research and innovation, alongside organisations representing the other parts of the quadruple helix. The RRI approach should be integrated in regional development policies, e.g. spatial planning, land use planning, coastal planning, urban development and urban structuring activities (list not exhaustive). Consortia should make strong efforts to ensure the involvement of all kind of citizens, irrespective of their age, gender, ethnicity and socio-economic background. Involvement of citizens must be in line with Article 21 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union.
Consortia should lay out a sequence of actions that open up and transform the R&I ecosystem and governance systems so that they are more open and inclusive.
Consortia will:
- Map their current territorial R&I ecosystem, taking into account and complementing existing mapping exercises such as the Smart Specialisation Platform[2], the European Cluster Observatory, and the Regional Innovation Scoreboard[3],
- Reflect on how the system could be more open and inclusive, and
- Consider their place within larger societal, geographical, economic and environmental framework.
- Consequently, proposals should develop concrete actions within individual beneficiaries' organisations (e.g. agenda setting and institutional changes in the fields of gender, ethics, public engagement, science education and open access) and in the territorial context (e.g. local and regional governance relations and decision-making processes).
Changes should be sustainable (i.e. last beyond the lifetime of funding), for instance through the introduction of new forms of decision-making, development of business plans or co-operation agreements, and institutional changes in participating organisations.
The actions should avoid duplicating the analytical and data collection activities of the Smart Specialisation Platform. Previous project findings and good practices should be considered as and when appropriate. Previous project findings and good practices should be considered as and when appropriate; projects such as TeRRIFICA[4], TeRRItoria, SeeRRI[5], ONLINE-S3[6] and SEiSMIC[7] could be useful in this regard. The ONLINE-S3 project aims to assist national and regional authorities in the EU to elaborate and revise their smart specialisation agendas, in terms of policies and strategy, whereas the SEiSMiC project helps tackle Europe's biggest urban problems by engaging citizens, identifying social innovation needs, and contributing to future urban policies and research strategies.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of the order of € 2.00 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
Consortia are expected to elaborate and implement a more open, transparent and democratic R&I system in their defined territories. Consortia are expected to evaluate their activities and provide evidence of societal, democratic, environmental, economic and scientific impacts. Involvement in the project should have a measurable transformative and opening effect on organisations involved, which should be sustainable beyond the lifetime of funding. Consortia are expected to contribute to one or more of the MoRRI indicators (for instance GE1, SLSE1, SLSE4, PE1, PE2, PE5, PE7, PE8, E1, OA6, GOV2)[8], and to the Sustainable Development Goals[9] (for instance goals 4, 5, 9, 11, 12, 13, 16 or 17).

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
The European Research Area (ERA) priorities underline the importance of an open labour market for researchers. This includes the removal of barriers to researchers mobility, training, and attractive careers. Europe will need around 1 Mio more researchers in the coming years; students, and young researchers need to be better informed about European opportunities so that they continue their research career.
EURAXESS – Researchers in Motion” is an initiative of the European Research Area (ERA) strategy that addresses barriers to the mobility of researchers and seeks to enhance scientific collaboration between Europe and the world. The initiative strives to become the global support and career development tool for European and international researchers, not only for their mobility experience inside and outside Europe, but also for their social networking with researchers from all over the world. Designed as a comprehensive tool-set it provides access to a complete range of information and support services.
Scope:
The ERA Mobility and Career Days, by building on the support of the members of the EURAXESS network, will help making a career in an European research institution more visible and hence attractive, both for researchers in Europe who are facing career decisions and for those who are currently outside Europe and might consider relocating to Europe to develop their research careers in Europe. This action aims at promoting jobs and growth by providing information on research careers, jobs and funding opportunities and support services to students and researchers on the ground. The career and mobility day will focus on countries where jobs and funding is scarce, in this respect information on European opportunities will be crucial for the young researchers’ generation. The event shall be open to researchers from all fields.
This action will support activities of the EURAXESS Service Network represented by EURAXESS Bridgehead organisations to organise in collaboration with research universities or institutions an information day/event that addresses mobility and career development of (young) researchers and students to maximize the career prospects. The ERA Mobility and Career Days are considered as opportunity for employers, recruiters and HR manager to have a customized on-campus event, matching then with students and researchers. Students and young researchers shall be given the opportunity to accelerate their knowledge and careers by talking to different specialists in the field. The programme shall include inter alia insightful presentations, practical workshop (for example on CV drafting and presentation skills) and one-to-one meetings with recruiters. Throughout the day/s networking opportunities shall be foreseen.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of the order of EUR 80 000 would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
This action allows for the provision of financial support to third parties in line with the conditions set out in Part K of the General Annexes.
Expected Impact:
The proposed action aims at a better knowledge about European job and funding opportunities mainly published on the EURAXESS Jobs portal and personalised assistance tools such as EURAXESS. In the medium term, the action aims at supporting jobs and growth and will contribute directly to the Horizon 2020 objective of cross-national and international circulation of researchers; it will increase the number of researchers who have access to research infrastructures through Union support and the number of excellent researchers overall. An additional impact should be to convince young people to embark on research careers with mobility.

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Research ethics is commonly associated with life sciences and in particular medical and biomedical research. The focus of the attention concerns interventions on humans, the involvement of children and vulnerable population. Because of the nature of the research and the lower risk attributed to the possible consequences of misconduct, non-medical research areas (such as social sciences) are less commonly associated with ethical concerns although researchers are regularly involved in protocols that have a direct impact on the wellbeing of people and as experts in policy making, provide evidence nurturing the decision process. In this context, ethical principles are of high importance. In case of breaches of these principles, the economic, social and environmental impact can be significant. Relevant principles are e.g. to only provide policy advise in fields related to one’s expertise, to distinguish ideology from science, to state clearly limitations to one’s scientific results, and be transparent on potential conflicts-of-interests.
In the current economic environment, the use of expertise in the definition of solutions and action plans constitutes a major challenge due to the high repercussions of related decisions on innovation capacities, jobs and well-being.
Scope:
It is of paramount importance, especially when there are different schools of thought, to ensure that the channelling and processing of expertise is adequately organised so as to enable optimal policy decisions. When the principles of responsible conduct of research are not followed, the socio-economic impact can be significant.
In order to support the Commission’s policy on boosting innovation, growth and high quality job and in the context of the post-2007 crisis, the action proposed shall aim at building an operational ethics and methodological framework facilitating that decision makers at national and EU level are provided with reliable evidence originating from cutting edge research. The conditions to maximise the Commission's policy outcomes and impact shall be studied, taking into account the necessity to comply with the highest standards of research ethics and integrity. Particular attention will be paid to the ethics of innovation and the enabling conditions for making innovation more relevant to the needs of society and more effectively meeting the Europe 2020 socioeconomic targets.
The proposed work shall also examine and analyse the relationship between science based policy advice, responsible conduct of research and research ethics. To this end an Oviedo/Helsinki type framework for non-medical research shall be proposed based on a wide consultation with all relevant stakeholders including industry and civil society. Such a framework shall discuss areas such as: a) covert research, b) working in dangerous areas/conflict zones and c) behavioral research collecting data from social media/internet sources.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of the order of EUR 2.8 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts
This action allows for the provision of financial support to third parties in line with the conditions set out in Part K of the General Annexes.
Expected Impact:
The proposed action will promote a more responsible and effective use of scientific information, originating from non-medical research areas, in support to EU policy making by increasing the understanding of the ethical challenges and proposing in response adequate ethical standards and normative framework for evidence based policy.

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Organoïds are considered to be key in the modelling and studying the development of organs as well as the progress of diseases. As a result, organoïds may hold the key to new breakthroughs in clinical research and to the development of new drugs and toxicology testing.
At the same time, organoïds are also a source of complex ethical questions. For example, clarification is needed on whether donors have property rights over them and whether they differ from cells and tissues with regard to their legal/moral status. Moreover, the storage of organoïds may create challenges for the governance of biobanks. Due to its nature, this research may not allow for complete de-identification of data and consequently questions of informed consent, privacy and return of results are at stake. An additional ethical concern regarding organoïds relates to their application in clinical care, in particular for the capacity to assess and handle the safety related issues.
Although these ethical dimensions have been explored in the past in the context of other types of biomedical research, the specific features of organoïd research and its potential for clinical application call for a re-evaluation of these aspects with a view to adapting, wherever necessary, the existing legal and ethics guidelines and policies.
Scope:
The action intends to explore the attitudes of the various stakeholders, including the research community, patients, donors and the public (taking into account gender aspects, where relevant), towards this type of research and innovation and its ethical implications. A comparative analysis of the perceived ethical implications with a similar group/family of technologies (for example bioelectronics) should be carried out.
The action should examine the impact of organoïd-based technologies, with a view to identifying the necessary elements that could best support the research community in integrating the ethics dimension into their research protocols.
A comparison within the EU and with other regions of the world, on the legal/regulatory and procedural framework (existing or under development) as well as on the level of societal awareness and acceptance, constitutes an important element of the work. Such an analysis should integrate the role of ethics committees and other advisory and regulatory structures.
The work undertaken is expected to produce (A) operational guidelines for the field. The guidelines should ensure “ethics by design” and be drafted to support the work of the research community, research ethics committees and integrity bodies. They should be in line with the new European code of conduct for research integrity[1]. The guidelines should include clear guidance for informed consent processes as well as guidance for the clinical applications of such research. They must also cover the governance of organoid biobanks.
The action should also propose (B) a code of responsible conduct for researchers (in academia and industry), taking into account the expectations of the different stakeholders. This is best achieved by actively involving civil society organisations and panels of citizens from different socio-economic groups including vulnerable populations.
Considering the rapid scientific evolution of the field, ways to enhance the existing ethics and normative frameworks (C) should be proposed.
As regards the research integrity aspects per se, the need to complement the above mentioned European Code with specific guidelines should be assessed. If needed, a proposal for (D) a short document complementing the Code should be made.
The action should, via a dedicated horizontal coordination work package, be implemented in cooperation with the action funded further to the call SwafS-29-2020, on ""The Ethics of technologies with high socio-economic impact"" which aims at performing the same work with three or four other technologies with a view to developing a detailed ethics framework for new and emerging technologies.
The action should include relevant expertise on ethics and research integrity as well as scientific and technical expertise. Furthermore, in line with the strategy for EU international cooperation in research and innovation (COM(2012)497), international cooperation is encouraged.
Publicly available results from relevant other EU funded research projects (notably PANELFIT, SHERPA, EnTIRE, SIENNA, I-CONSENT, ENERI, PRINTEGER, and TRUST) should be taken into account.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of the order of EUR 3.00 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
This action will provide a comprehensive overview of the ethical and normative aspects stemming from organoïd and similar types of research. It should also enable an effective ethics governance of such research.
It will concretely provide support to the ethics committees, research integrity bodies and other organisations confronted with these issues and ultimately lead to reducing potential risks while providing an enabling framework for researchers and innovators.
Overall, the action will contribute to the establishment of an ethics framework for new technologies which, because of their fast growing impact on citizens' everyday life, is becoming a global societal priority.

Technologies with potentially high socio-economic impact[1] raising complex ethical issues must be analysed from an ethical perspective to maximise their societal benefit and minimise harm. The exponential scientific progress resulting in the mushrooming of these new technologies (e.g. gene editing, DNA digital data storage, Artificial Intelligence, etc.), calls for a coherent research and innovation ethics approach at EU level
Scope:
This work aims at complementing the work started in the context of SwafS-18-2016 call that addressed three areas: genomics, human enhancement and man-machine interactions (project SIENNA[2]. The action should conduct a similar analysis and refine the model and guidelines produced by the project funded under the above call. In order to do so, the action should carry out a thorough scanning of the technology horizon to identify three or four different technologies (or family of technologies) with an equivalent socio-economic impact.
This horizon scanning constitute an important part of the action since it aims at selecting the technologies that have or are likely to have the most significant ethics dimension and societal impact while best complementing the work already carried out by SIENNA. Cooperation and synergies with SIENNA[2] and other relevant projects (notably PANELFIT, SHERPA, EnTIRE, I-CONSENT, ENERI, PRINTEGER, and TRUST) will be established, via a dedicated horizontal coordination work package. This work package should also pay particular attention to the cooperation with the project(s) resulting from call SwafS-28-2020.
For each (family of) technology, the action should explore the attitudes of the various stakeholders, including the research community and the broader public, towards this type of research and innovation and its ethical implications.
The action should also examine the impact of these technologies notably with a view to identifying the necessary elements that could best support the research community in integrating the ethics dimension into their research protocols.
A comparison within the EU and with other regions of the world, on both the legal/regulatory and procedural framework (existing or under development) as well as on the level of societal awareness and acceptance, constitutes an important element of the work. This analysis should integrate the role of ethics committees and other advisory and regulatory structures.
The work undertaken should result in (A) operational guidelines for the research and innovation conducted in each of the studied fields. The guidelines should ensure “ethics by design” and be drafted to support the work of the research community, research ethics committees and integrity bodies. They must be in line with the new European code of conduct for research integrity[4].
The action should also propose (B) a code of responsible conduct for researchers (in academia and industry), taking into account the expectations of the different stakeholders. This should be achieved by actively involving civil society organisations and panels of citizens from different socio-economic groups including vulnerable populations, taking into consideration gender aspects.
Considering the rapid scientific evolution of the field, ways to enhance existing ethics and normative frameworks (C) should be proposed.
As regards the research integrity aspects per se, the need to complement the above mentioned European Code with specific guidelines should be assessed. If needed, a proposal for (D) short documents complementing the Code should be made.
The extension of the analysis to other new or emerging technologies, initiated by SwafS-18-2016, should be used as a basis to develop a detailed ethics framework for new and emerging technologies which should go through a validation process (e.g. using case studies involving key stakeholders).
The action should also assess the possible need for dedicated legislation at EU level. This tasks should be covered by the horizontal coordination work package mentioned above.
The action should include relevant expertise on ethics and research integrity as well as scientific and technical expertise. Furthermore, in line with the strategy for EU international cooperation in research and innovation (COM(2012)497), international cooperation is encouraged.
Publicly available results from relevant other EU funded research projects (the projects covered by the horizontal coordination work package should be taken into account.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of the order of EUR 4.00 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
The proposed action will address the growing ethics challenges and expectations vis-à-vis new technologies to ensure the highest ethics standards at EU and at an international level. It will provide an ethics framework, which should enable the effective ethics governance of these technologies.
The work undertaken will help reconciling the needs of the research teams and the legitimate concerns of the citizens, while stimulating innovation and contributing to the reduction of socio-economic inequalities including, in health treatment, social status and social inclusion and gender equality. It will support the work of the field actors confronted with these issues. Overall, the action will lead to reducing the risks while proving an enabling framework for researchers and innovators.
Overall, it will contribute to the development of new approaches in addressing ethical issues of new and emerging technologies, promoting research integrity and responsible conduct of research.

EURAXESS will help making a career in European research and innovation more attractive, both for researchers in Europe who are facing career decisions and for those who are currently outside Europe and might consider relocating to Europe to develop their careers here.
Scope:
The objective of the action is to further intensify the services provided by the EURAXESS Service Centres expand the recently developed mandate of taking care of the career development of mainly young researchers in Europe with particular focus on female Higher Education Institution students and researchers. The newly developed services of the EURAXESS network reach out to mobile and non-mobile researchers with the aim to contribute to the completion of the ERA and the Responsible Research and Innovation field as well to open more career opportunities in the industry. This action will support activities the EURAXESS Service Network represented by Bridgehead organisations to address strategic issues related to the launched widening of the services from mainly mobility-related to services also for non-mobile researchers. The set-up of career development and/or support for dual careers centres shall be expanded over a wider geographical range of the network, support to researchers and young entrepreneurs for start-ups in SME’s and industry and concepts for better integration of researchers into the culture of the host country and to the culture of a business environment, as well as mentoring programmes for researchers.
Other services for researchers shall be proposed: for instance, national EURAXESS website shall provide information on start-up schemes in the respective country and relate to policy information as provided on the European EURAXESS portal about EU research policies for researchers and EU schemes developing more career opportunities. This includes, issues related to ERA and Responsible Research and Innovation. Activities such as the deepening of existing services through trainings, seminars, networking and updating of national EURAXESS portals shall also be part of this action.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of the order of EUR 3.35 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
This action allows for the provision of financial support to third parties in line with the conditions set out in Part K of the General Annexes.
Expected Impact:
Better take up of career development guidance and the collaboration with start-ups and SME will contribute to innovation in research.
Increased job and funding opportunities on the EURAXESS Jobs portal and personalised assistance to researchers will accelerate the career development of young researchers, in particular female researchers. In the medium term, the action will produce efficiency gains and reduce transaction costs by creating a better match of existing talent and R&I needs and capacity in European research institutions and businesses. It will contribute directly to the Horizon 2020 objective of cross-national and international circulation of researchers; it will increase the number of researchers who have access to research infrastructures through Union support and the number of excellent researchers overall. It will contribute to meeting ERA objectives on gender equality. Over time, the action will contribute directly towards European targets on R&DI intensity and percentage of researchers in the active population, and to boost European research and innovation competitiveness.
By increasing the service level of the whole EURAXESS Services Network the benefit for the research community will be long-lasting and far-reaching

","17 November 2020","Specific Challenge:
Much analysis has been carried out on the importance of science education both in schools and in higher education. However, science education outside the classroom, which refers to informal science education, and the science education effects of non-educational activities, are not well explored in terms of their nature and effects. Acquiring knowledge, and in particular, evaluating knowledge, often with the help of the Internet, is happening in reality frequently, and should be recognised for what it contributes in terms of more sophisticated consumers and scientific citizenship. Consideration of what is available and what is being learnt would be useful to understand how science education outside the classroom influences today's citizens.
Scope:
The available knowledge on science education outside the classroom and its impact on citizens (including students of all ages from school children to college students) need to be analysed, taking into account possible gender and geographical differences. The proposed action shall specify if this type of learning complements the classroom or succeeds where classrooms might have failed. Consideration should be given to the impact that can be achieved in science education outside schools and how this form of informal schooling might be accredited and whether there is a way of assessing the quality of the educational contents.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution between EUR 1.30 million and EUR 1.70 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
In the short term, the proposed action should identify good practices outside the classroom. It should consider what impact this information might have on formal and informal science education for students and citizens. In the medium term, the results of the present action will help the EU to better understand the effects of science education outside the regular education institutions and will increase the range of innovative products in science education that reflect societal needs. In the long term the results of the research should contribute to considerations on accrediting the available information.

Europe's vibrant research and innovation ecosystem produces a third of the world's high impact publications and patent applications. It is crucial to sustain this excellent track record. One of the ways to achieve this is by celebrating European science, thereby by reaching out to the public and stimulating interest in research careers among students. High level scientific events provide the optimal fora, especially when they bring students into direct contact with experienced distinguished scientists so that they can gain useful insight and advice from those with successful and rewarding careers.
Scope:
The events should be very high level, with a strong international presence, gathering prestigious speakers addressing an audience of young as well as experienced researchers. Gatherings should be recurrent, take place over several days, have a strong European focus with European science and its impressive results at its centre should benefit from. Public engagement methods will be employed to explore links between science, politics, industry and culture, to create a dialogue across disciplines and generations and to promote European integration.
Proposals should include plans to ensure that students from across Europe are made aware of the possibility to participate at such gatherings. The procedure for selecting candidates should be described and should respect the principles of transparency and fairness to ensure a balanced participation in terms of country and gender. The proposals should describe in detail the mechanisms through which the students will be able to meet and interact with experienced distinguished scientists.
A strong outreach strategy is mandatory. Consideration should be given to the use of audiovisual and internet media as a means of broadcasting the meetings between the students and the prestigious speakers, to a wider public. The meetings should use participatory methods to ensure public engagement. A workshop should be organised at each event to provide information on ""European Research Career Opportunities"". This should be open to all participants and should be scheduled during the main scientific program. An appropriate communication strategy should be described, designed to ensure proper and full visibility to European Union research policies and programmes and to the concrete opportunities offered to young researchers. It should include precise deliverables, to be implemented during the event, and in all communication activities and materials preceding and following the event.
The proposals will cover scientific gatherings or clusters of gatherings taking place in 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019 and 2020.
The proposals should be in line with the Horizon 2020 Responsible Research and Innovation (RRI) cross-cutting issues of engaging society, integrating the gender and ethical dimensions, ensuring access to research outcomes and encouraging formal and informal science education.The proposals should promote European Union actions in the field of science, research and innovation with a particular emphasis on the interaction between science and society.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of EUR 0.5 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately.

","Research and Innovation action
","10 December 2019
","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Gender-based violence (GBV) [1] is happening across the European Union (EU) and is a human rights violation. It is both a cause and a consequence of inequalities between women and men. There exist numerous reports of women and men within European universities and research institutions, who have experienced sexual harassment and who report its detrimental effects on their personal wellbeing as well as their scientific career. GBV including sexual harassment in European universities and research organisations tends to be underestimated and there is little knowledge about it. Several studies have shown that women in precarious working conditions (e.g. PhD students) or exchange students seem to be particularly at risk to experience GBV or sexual harassment.
Scope:
Building on existing studies and knowledge generated in previous research initiatives, at national or European level, such as EU-funded Horizon 2020 Gender Equality Plan projects, the Gender Equality in Academia and Research (GEAR) tool[2], as well as projects[2] funded through the DAPHNE strand of the Rights, Equality and Citizenship Programme[2], this research and innovation action will:
Investigate the various forms of GBV including sexual harassment in European higher education systems and research organisations, for both staff and students, including the particular situation of those with short-term affiliations to the organisation (e.g. visiting academic staff, exchange students) as well as potential additional social determinants, (e.g. ethnicity, sexual orientation). It will build on previous research and, where needed, collect quantitative and qualitative data from at least 15 Member States and Associated Countries, taking various geographical locations into account. National legal and policy frameworks should be also taken into account.
Identify the role of universities and research organisations, including research funding organisations as well as the role of support networks in A) preventing various forms of GBV (e.g. changing social attitudes and behaviour in order to end tolerance of all forms of violence; awareness raising through e.g. forum theatre); B) protecting victims (e.g. psychological, medical and legal support; anti- retaliation policies; training staff, including bystanders, to respond to early signs of GBV; securing campuses and workplaces and C) prosecuting the perpetrators (e.g. procedures to document GBV incidents; consequences for perpetrators at organisation-level; reporting to the police)
Develop evidence-based case studies of implemented measures at organisation-level for each of the above- mentioned aspects (prevention, protection and prosecution) and outline what works and what does not work in various contexts
Formulate concrete recommendations for universities and research organisations, including research funding organisations, on how to combat GBV in its various forms; and develop prevention plans, hands-on tool-kits, training material and dissemination material (like videos, infographics, brochures, etc.) that can be implemented and used by universities and research organisations through their Gender Equality Plans or as stand-alone measures.
Disseminate its outcomes and materials (case studies, recommendations, toolkits, awareness-raising material etc.) to European research organisations and universities on GBV including sexual harassment and carry out information sessions and trainings for decision-makers, staff and students. Produced material will be made available at the “Gender Equality in Academia and Research” (GEAR) tool’s website[5].
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU between EUR 2.80 million and EUR 3.20 million and duration of 36 months would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts or duration.
Expected Impact:
Better understanding of GBV in European universities and research organisations. Effective policies and measures implemented at universities and research organisations. Increased capacity of staff and students to address GBV. Reduction of GBV in academic environments and research workplaces in Europe.

The Science4Refugees initiative is directed towards refugee researchers/scientists who have applied for and been granted asylum in a host country, which will enable them to continue their educational path or enter the labour market. Under the header ""Science4Refugees"" a number of initiatives will be brought together on the EURAXESS portal.
Information available on the education level of recently arrived asylum seekers and refugees points to a rather wide distribution in terms of education level. In Germany, the share of those who attended university was on average around 20% according to the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees but it varies widely across countries of origin and the same is true in Sweden. In any case, there is evidence that at least part of the recently arrived refugees have a tertiary education degree and intend to pursue their studies or research in the host country. To integrate them into Europe's research system, specific measures are required in terms of enhancing the employability and the skills of refugees.
The objective of this action is to scale up existing initiatives and bring them to a European level.
Scope:
This action will support activities at the institutional, regional or national level to scale up their activities for refugees from a regional to a European level. These initiatives will give refugees researchers/scientists the opportunity to develop their knowledge and careers by improving their skills and experience.
The initiatives will have the potential to be scaled up to a European level during the implementation phase, with a take-up on the EURAXESS portal, eg. databases for language courses or webinars on entrepreneurship and other training needs.
This action is aimed at entities which have established initiatives (minimum 2 years) to support refugee researchers/scientists to update their skills and employability at the European labour market. Entities dealing with the first basic needs of refugees such as accommodation or clothing, or educational needs for children, are not targeted.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU in the order of EUR 100 000 would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nevertheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
provide financial and employability support to initiatives that support the integration of refugees into their new employment setting and culture, and to prepare refugees for the highly competitive and highly skilled job market. The visibility of these financially supported initiatives will be increased by making use of the EURAXESS Portal for dissemination, giving them high EU visibility & offering EU coordination support. In the medium term, the action aims at supporting research jobs and growth; it will increase the number of highly skilled workers who are sufficiently prepared to access the European labour market by using their newly gained skills and experience through the supported actions."

Female creativity and innovation potential are an under-exploited source of economic growth and creation of jobs. While women constitute 52% of the total European population, and 59% of first level university graduates[1], they only represent 40% of employed scientists and engineers[1], and 30% of start-up entrepreneurs. Women hold less than 10% of patent applications.
Innovation plays a key role in addressing and solving societal challenges. It is time to break gender stereotypes, in particular in innovation and entrepreneurship, and to create a smart, sustainable and inclusive innovation ecosystem that encourages young girls to become women innovators and that provides them with the support they need to be successful.
Scope:
The topic will support initiatives such as hands on activities, seminars, mentoring sessions, gender-inclusive innovative tools, etc. to develop entrepreneurial competences and inspire the next generation of innovators. These will be implemented with the support of role models (e.g. former winners of the EU Prize for Women Innovators).
The activities will involve inter alia grass roots organisations, schools, foundations, science and technology museums, incubators, start-ups, innovative industries, etc. Activities will build on the work carried out by other European initiatives or funded projects, such as Scientix, Hypatia [3] and EUCYS (European Union Contest for Young Scientists). Activities should create sustainable collaborative networks and cover at least 16 Member States and/or Associated Countries.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU in the order of EUR 1.50 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
In the short term, the action will raise awareness of the gender gap in innovation. It will encourage sustainable collaboration among schools, science and technology museums, foundations, start-ups, etc, while involving young people in the innovation ecosystem. In the long term, it will contribute to increasing the number of female innovators in Europe. It will also contribute to wider European Union objectives by better matching skills to jobs.

","10 December 2019
","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Open Science constitutes a ""new approach to the scientific process based on cooperative work and new ways of diffusing knowledge by using digital technologies and new collaborative tools.""[1] As opposed to traditional practices in science and technology, which largely focus on the publication of research results in scientific journals, Open Science focuses on sharing and (re)using all available knowledge and data throughout the research process.[1] This includes among others, the more active participation of citizens in the scientific process (citizen science)[1], open access to peer-reviewed scientific publications and scientific research data [4],open peer reviews and metrics for measuring research output (e.g. altmetrics). [1]
Open Science aims to promote transparency and reproducibility of results, increase and widen the diffusion of knowledge and may overall accelerate scientific progress and innovation.
At the same time, in order to maximize the benefits of Open Science, there are several ethical, legal and social challenges that need to be addressed. Such challenges include:
- possible development of new forms of malpractice
- risk of diluting research results of high quality (emergence of fake science)
- risk of new bias in the assessment of the quality of the research output and impact notably via the alternative metrics
- issues related to content-mining, the privacy of data subjects, potential conflicts with intellectual property and data protection rights
- the emergence of questionable dissemination/publication practices like the proliferation of predatory journals that exploit the open access publishing business model.
The strong connection between Open Science and research integrity has been underlined in the Council conclusions on research integrity, where the Member States recognise ""the importance of open science as a mechanism for reinforcing research integrity, while, at the same time, research integrity contributes to open science.""[1]
Scope:
The action should examine and map the ethical, legal and social implications/challenges as well as the research integrity issues related to Open Science, and consequently identify and analyse the necessary elements to support the integration of research ethics and integrity as structural component of Open Science.
Issues to be addressed include, among others, the need to develop appropriate infrastructure and tools for handling sensitive personal data (especially with regards to the anonymisation/pseudonymisation mechanisms, the possibility to seek the informed consent of the data subject in case of further research, data storage and security measures in place). In this context, the action should explore, among others, to what extent the application of Blockchain in the context of open data could address concerns related, for example, to privacy, and examine further the use of this technology in the context of open data, evaluating the opportunities and limitations.[7]
The action should also explore ethical issues and opportunities related to the implications of Open Science on reproducibility, on the evaluation of science and scientific reputation, on scholarly communication and on the involvement of citizens in the scientific process.
The specificities of different disciplines should be clearly delineated (e.g. with regards to qualitative data from social sciences and humanities research) and issues related to inter-institutional, inter-disciplinary and international collaboration among all actors in research and innovation should be explored.
The work should be based on a bottom-up approach, gauging the attitudes of all relevant stakeholders (e.g. researchers, research funders, publishers and citizens) through the organisation of workshops and consultations and encourage change in the research culture by promoting communication and dialogue.
Ultimately, the work undertaken should result in (A) a detailed strategic/policy assessment that will enable the Commission to establish policy options as well as practical ways to support the work of relevant stakeholders in promoting responsible Open Science - defined as Open Science adhering to the highest research ethics and integrity standards. The European code of conduct for research integrity[8] will be a main reference.
The work undertaken should also result in (B) operational guidelines to support the work of research teams. This should notably address the need to respect Open Science related obligations in the preparation of proposals to request funding at EU level or in other contexts.
The need to complement the European Code with specific guidelines should be also assessed. If needed, a proposal (C) for short documents complementing the Code should be made.
In addition, this action should produce (D) traditional and online training material (reflecting the guidelines) on responsible Open Science for students, young and experienced researchers. The material will form part of the training e-platform created by European Network of Research Ethics and Research Integrity (ENERI)[9] and hosted by European Commission platform SINAPSE[9].
In addition to the above cited network, it is essential to ensure that the publicly available results from relevant EU funded research projects (e.g. PRINTEGER[11], EnTIRE[12] TRUST, MoRRI[13] and RRI-Practice[14] ) are taken into account. Cooperation with the projects should be the subject of a dedicated horizontal coordination work package.
In line with the strategy for EU international cooperation in research and innovation [COM(2012)497], international cooperation is encouraged.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of the order of EUR 2.50 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
The action will provide a comprehensive overview of the ethics and research integrity issues and opportunities related to Open Science and how they can be effectively handled at EU level. Furthermore, the action will promote a model balancing the need for openness with relevant ethical, legal, social and research integrity considerations.

","Coordination and support action
","12 April 2017
","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
With a view to addressing adequately the challenge of the internationalisation of research, including in the context of EU collaborations, it is necessary to strengthen the EU capacity to foster and promote the highest ethical standards and to achieve a higher degree of consistency of research integrity practices in Europe. In the latter regard, the Council, with its conclusions of 1st December 2015 on Research Integrity, invited the Member States and the Commission to support ""training activities based on the ""train-the-trainer"" principle""[1]
.
Scope:
The participants are expected to develop innovative methods to train-the trainers on ethics and research integrity (such as training courses, workshops, a continuous support service to the trainers) based on consultation and the direct involvement of all relevant stakeholders representing both public and private structures (i.e. research intensive industries). These training methods should, in particular, promote the consistent application of the principles listed in the ""European Code of Conduct for Research Integrity"" developed by the European Science Foundation (ESF) and All European Academies (ALLEA)[2]
.
The activities should aim at enhancing the training skills and improve existing methods at two levels:
(i) at the level of training the trainers, the different activities should mainly aim at:
- enhancing the knowledge of the trainer with regard to ethics and research integrity issues. This will ensure the consistent application of EU research ethics and integrity standards while allowing for national particularities (national laws, cultural differences) to be taken into account;
- allowing trainers to develop their training and interpersonal skills, such as their skill to understand the audience's needs and tailor the training accordingly, their ability to make lecture-based programmes more interactive and their ability to improve/enhance existing training methods. The use of innovative methods will foster the ethics and research integrity culture of the trainees and therefore will encourage them to depart from an approach of mere compliance with legal frameworks to a ""virtue ethics approach"" i.e. to embed ethics and integrity within the research design.
(ii) at the level of training the researchers, the different activities should mainly aim at:
- the creation and regular update of ready to use learning/training material, such as slides, e-learning courses, videos, and using the social media as a training resource. Enhancing the impact of the training by the use of non-traditional forms (art, theatre) should be explored;
- the creation and update of training material, which can be adapted for the needs of the targeted audiences; and
- enhancing the researchers' understanding of the private and socio-economic benefits of the conduct of research according to the highest ethical and research integrity standards and of the negative impact of research misconduct on society, research institutions/research performers and on the researcher (e.g. in the form of ""reputational damage"").
The participants are expected to create an e-community/database (using the EU Commission tool SINAPSE hosted on the EU data centre), where all the training material/tools will be available. Moreover, the participants are expected to develop and submit plans that will ensure the long term viability (including financial sustainability) of the ""train the trainers"" activities and the update of the relevant training material/tools and the management of the e-community/database..
Overall, the action should aim at the training of a sufficient number of trainers in each Member State depending on the particular needs in each Member State.
In order to avoid duplication of work already undertaken and to allow for synergies among the relevant EU funded research projects (from FP7 and Horizon 2020), it is essential to ensure that the participants will cooperate and make use of all the publicly available results from the related funded projects, such as:
- the PRINTEGER project (GARRI.5.2014 – ""Ethics in Research: Promoting integrity"");
- ""Estimating the costs of research misconduct and the socio-economic benefit of research integrity"" (GARRI.9.2015);
- the ""European Ethics and Research Integrity Network"" (GARRI.10.2015); and
- ""Mapping the Ethics and Research Integrity Normative Framework"" (SwafS-16-2016).
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of the order of EUR 2.8 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
This action allows for the provision of financial support to third parties in line with the conditions set out in Part K of the General Annexes.
Expected Impact:
It is expected that the present action will promote a higher degree of consistency of research integrity practices in Europe, will strengthen the research communities' capacity to respect the highest ethical standards and will enable researchers to adopt a ""virtue ethics approach"", i.e. to embed ethics and integrity within the research design.

","Research and Innovation action
","06 November 2018
","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
To exploit the potential of big data approaches for research and innovation policy making by providing more timely and in depth information on the performance of the research and innovation system and its links to productivity growth.
Scope:
Many of the advanced economies have, since the crisis, been faced with a productivity paradox: while the pace of innovation continues to accelerate, productivity growth has come to a quasi-standstill. The reasons for this have been the subject of intense debate over the past years and evidence increasingly points to the importance of the links between productivity growth and research and innovation. Seminal work by the OECD[1] has pointed to the importance of technology diffusion in this respect, which could also be linked to the changing nature of the innovation process itself, which is going through profound changes, with notably digitalisation leading to increasing complexity, stronger networking effects and a growing importance of winner takes all characteristics.
If research and innovation policy making is to adapt to this rapidly changing environment in an evidence based manner, it needs solid and timely data to support its decisions and it is becoming increasingly clear that official statistics, if relying on traditional sources, cannot continue to provide a full picture of all the dynamics of today's research and innovation systems. However, in today's increasingly digitalised world, alternative sources of data have being emerging exponentially, generated by the use of information and communication technologies and their diffusion through the web. This includes, for instance, information contained in company websites, social media posts, but also increasingly databases being made available by e.g. governments. Such data sources, commonly known as big data, have the advantage of being widely available in a timely manner, have the potential of being able to cover a variety of aspects of research and innovation performance, allow to provide information at a more granular level and examine in a better way social interactions, all of which is not possible through the indicators currently provided by official statistics.
Proposals should aim at exploiting the potential of big data to produce information on research and innovation activity, performance, output and/or impact which has the potential to be available in real time, focusing notably on research and innovation investments in the private sector, public-private cooperation and technology diffusion between private actors. Proposals should also take into account aspects of data accuracy and data security.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU in the order of EUR 1 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
The outcomes of the Research and Innovation Actions are expected to provide research and innovation policy making with more timely and diverse data on research and innovation activity, performance, output and/or impact.

The present call for proposals is to co-fund exercise projects aimed at assessing and improving Union Civil Protection Mechanism response to major emergencies.
Civil Protection Mechanism Exercise projects
The Union Civil Protection Mechanism, hereafter the Mechanism, was established by Decision No 1313/2013/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 December 2013 on a Union Civil Protection Mechanism (hereinafter the Decision). In broad terms, the Mechanism aims to provide support, upon request, in the event of major emergencies and to facilitate improved coordination of assistance intervention. It should facilitate the response to protect primarily people but also the environment and property, including cultural heritage, in the event of natural and man-made disasters, acts of terrorism and technological, radiological or environmental accidents, including accidental marine pollution, occurring inside or outside the European Union, taking into account the special needs of the isolated, outermost and other regions or islands of the European Union.
The term ""exercises"" refers to a range of activities that span from validate existing capabilities to exploring new ones, from focusing on a national response team's performance to focusing on the trans-governmental and cross-sectorial emergency response mechanisms. They are designed to enhance the readiness and capacities of national response and to test or validate crisis management procedures.
The purpose of this call is to enable and support exercise projects which provide opportunities in controlled environments to asses, learn from and improve the response capability of Participating States of the Mechanism and the European Commission.
Scope:
The Civil Protection Work Programme 2017, in its Action 2.6, provides the framework for the implementation of the priorities set up in the legislation for the exercise programme:
The objective:
To improve civil protection preparedness and response to all kinds of disasters, including marine pollution[1], and chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear (CBRN) disasters, as well as combined disasters and disasters simultaneously affecting a number of countries (inside or outside the participating states of the Mechanism) by providing a testing environment of established and/or new operational concepts and procedures of the Mechanism and a learning opportunity for all actors involved in civil protection assistance interventions under the Mechanism.
Expected Impact:
The expected results under this Call are:
Improving the response capacity of Member States, in particular with regard to teams and other assets provided in civil protection assistance interventions.
Improving and verifying the procedures and establishing a common approach for the coordination of civil protection assistance interventions and reducing the time taken to deploy in major disasters.
Enhancing cooperation between the civil protection and marine pollution services of the Member States, the Commission and other relevant actors.
Identifying and sharing lessons learned.
Testing the implementation of lessons learned
TYPE OF ACTIVITIES WHICH CAN BE FINANCED UNDER THIS CALL
Plan, conduct and evaluate exercises with scenarios simulating the situation and conditions of all types of disasters for the activation of the Mechanism, including marine pollution and CBRN disasters, as well as combined disasters and disasters affecting simultaneously a number of countries (inside or outside the participating states of the Mechanism). The plans for the exercises should also take into account the results of evaluations of previous exercises as well as lessons learned from civil protection actions. Needs of vulnerable groups including persons with disabilities should also be taken into consideration.
The exercises can be full scale exercises, command post exercises with limited deployment, and table top exercises. A combination of two or three of these exercise concepts is considered as strength.
The involvement of Member States is ensured through the ERCC, according to established procedures (e.g. use of CECIS, and activation of the Mechanism) and deployment of exercise participants as defined in Art. 32 of Commission Implementing Decision 2014/762/EU laying down rules for the implementation of Decision No 1313/2013/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council on a Union Civil Protection Mechanism i.e. intervention teams (including modules), teams of assessment and/or coordination experts (EUCPT), national key contact point staff, other intervention support resources and officials of the EU Institutions, including humanitarian aid experts (if required by the scenario).

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
The present call for proposals aims at funding projects in the area of prevention, preparedness and awareness-raising in civil protection and marine pollution.
Preparedness Projects
The term preparedness means a state of readiness and capability of human and material means, structures, communities and organisations enabling them to ensure an effective rapid response to a disaster, obtained as a result of action taken in advance.[1]
Preparedness is essential in the management of disasters - being well prepared can save lives and reduce the impact of disasters. In order to enhance European civil protection preparedness, this Call will fund primarily preparedness projects which build on the Decision No 1313/2013/EU.
The Union Civil Protection Mechanism (UCPM) is intended to improve the level of preparedness of civil protection systems, their personnel and population. When natural or man-made disasters strike a country, within the European Union or outside, the Mechanism allows for the necessary operational resources to be mobilised to assist and provide a prompt response.
As such, a project may very well be used to develop new concepts or models within the framework of the UCPM training programmes, or to identify ways of increasing efficiency with regard to deployment and/or plans for deployment of operational assets and modules to disaster stricken areas. This could include the establishment and/or development of multi-national modules. Such a project could also be used to develop new and more efficient ways of conducting UCPM exercises, of drawing up lessons following disasters, of planning emergency operations, etc.
Scope:
Objectives
Improve the preparedness of the Union Civil Protection Mechanism to respond to disaster risks.
Develop cooperation across countries on challenges in the field of civil protection and/or marine pollution and enhance the awareness of professionals and volunteers.
Complement existing cooperation frameworks/instruments provided by relevant EU macro-regional strategies.
Support a closer partnership between the Union Civil Protection Mechanism and enlargement and Neighbourhood countries.
PREPAREDNESS PRIORITIES

Expected Impact:
Improving the response capacity of Member States, in particular with
regard to teams and other assets provided in civil protection assistance
interventions.
Improving and verifying the procedures and establishing a common
approach for the coordination of civil protection assistance interventions
and reducing the time taken to deploy in major disasters.
Enhancing cooperation between the civil protection and marine pollution
services of Member States, the Commission and other relevant actors.
Identifying and sharing lessons learned.
Testing the implementation of lessons learned.
TYPE OF ACTIVITIES WHICH CAN BE FINANCED UNDER THIS CALL
Design, plan, conduct and evaluate exercises with scenarios simulating the
situation and conditions of all types of disasters for the activation of the
Mechanism, including marine pollution, forest fires, and CBRN disasters,
as well as combined disasters and disasters affecting simultaneously a
number of countries (inside or outside the participating states of the
Mechanism), taking into account climate change impacts where
appropriate. The design and planning for the exercises should also take
into account the results of evaluations of previous exercises as well as
lessons learned from civil protection actions. Towards the end of the
exercise project, recommendations and a plan to implement the
recommendations should be developed based on the findings that have
been outlined in the evaluation.
The exercises can be full-scale exercises, command post exercises with
limited deployment, and table top exercises. A combination of two or
three of these exercise concepts is considered as strength. The involvement
of Member States is ensured through the ERCC, according to established
procedures (e.g. use of CECIS, and activation of the Mechanism) and
deployment of exercise participants as defined in Article 32 of
Commission Implementing Decision 2014/762/EU laying down rules for
the implementation of Decision No 1313/2013/EU of the European
Parliament and of the Council on a Union Civil Protection Mechanism14,
i.e. intervention teams (including modules), teams of assessment and/or
coordination experts (EUCPT), national key contact point staff, other
intervention support resources and officials of the EU Institutions,
including humanitarian aid experts (if required by the scenario).

This call supports full-scale exercise projects aiming to design, plan, conduct and evaluate exercises with scenarios simulating the situation and conditions of all types of disasters calling for the activation of the Mechanism.
The overall objective of the Mechanism is to strengthen cooperation among Member States and facilitate coordination in the field of civil protection in order to improve the effectiveness of the system for preventing, preparing for and responding to natural and man-made disasters. In accordance with the principle of subsidiarity, it can make support available on request if a disaster overwhelms the response capacity of an affected country. By pooling the civil protection capabilities of participating states, the Mechanism can ensure better protection primarily of people, but also of the natural and cultural environment and of property.
A training and exercises programme has been established with a view to enhance the coordination of civil protection assistance interventions by ensuring improved compatibility and interoperability between the intervention teams and other intervention support as well as by improving the competence of the experts involved. The exercise programme comprises full-scale field exercises, as well as more specific exercises for modules, other response capacities, experts and TAST.
In November 2017, the European Commission presented a proposal amending Decision No 1313/2013/EU (rescEU). Among its objectives, the proposal aims at strengthening disaster preparedness by opening the door to the development of the Union Civil Protection Knowledge Network. The specific objectives of the Network will be to build a common disaster preparedness culture, to provide training for civil protection and emergency management personnel, to increase inter-operability and host nation support measures, and to foster interaction and synergies between civil protection and humanitarian actors. It will contribute to lessons learned, to sharing of knowledge, dissemination of results of scientific research and exchange of best practices across Europe.

Topic: Prevention and Preparedness for Cross-border Risks
Disasters know no borders. Most natural and man-made disasters therefore present cross-border risks due to their spatial dimension (earthquakes, fires, severe weather, floods and space weather), as well as the volatility and scale of their impacts (pandemics, livestock epidemics, nuclear/industrial accidents). The human, economic or environmental impacts - including the impact on cultural heritage - of these hazards, as well as their likelihood of occurrence exist irrespective of national borders. In fact, the EU can benefit from tackling cross-border risks beyond its borders, particularly in IPA beneficiaries and in the Southern and Eastern Neighbourhoods.
The increasing complexity and emergence of new threats require more cross-sectoral, transdisciplinary and cross-country cooperation in all risk management phases.
Various EU legislative acts already require a collaborative approach to disaster risk assessment and management: for example, for flood risks or cross-border threats to health. The revised UCPM Decision also aims at stepping up the collaboration at cross-border level and between Member States prone to the same types of disasters.
While cross-border cooperation is relatively well-established in the area of emergency response, cross-border cooperation during the prevention and preparedness phases could be further enhanced. Notwithstanding, the response phase could also benefit from streamlined communication protocols and interoperable systems that overcome language barriers in emergency situations.
By focussing on countries that share a border, this Call for Proposals aims to foster a more sustained cooperation in cross-border regions.
This topic aims to enhance cross-border disaster risk management through prevention and preparedness in Europe and EU Neighbourhood countries.
Aplicants are invited to focus on one of the following call priorities (specific objectives):
Priority 1: Developing cross-border risk assessments
Without a risk assessment which takes into account cross-border risks, risk management will only partially address the risks a country faces.
The 2017 Overview of Risks already recognised that cross-border dimensions of risks could benefit from a more systematic focus in future risk assessments. Analysis of national risk assessments submitted to the European Commission in 2018/2019 again revealed that while cross-sectoral interdependencies of risks are tackled to some extent, the cross-border/regional/international dimension is still missing. Good practices already exist: the joint cross-border Benelux risk assessment, the Baltic Sea Region risk assessment or the Nordic Forum for Risk Analysis and Strategic Foresight.
In order to contribute to achieving Priority 1, this Call for Proposals will co-finance activities that aim to analyse risks with cross-border impacts, either building up to or already developing a cross-border risk assessment through the project. Beneficiaries will be civil protection authorities and stakeholders in Member States, IPA beneficiaries not participating in the Mechanism, and/or European Neighbourhood Policy countries that share a border.
In particular, project activities and outputs should lead to the achievement of up to two (2) of the following outcomes:
1.1 Cross-border risk assessments for identified cross-border risks are developed;
1.2 Joint data/information-sharing tools or platforms are established;
1.3 A network of competent authorities at national and sub-national level for specific risks is established;
1.4 Cross-border risk management plans or action plans for one or more risks (identified in a cross-border risk assessment) are developed.
Examples of project activities and outputs to be funded include, among others:
Risk assessment report including, where appropriate, analytical products preparatory to a risk assessment, such as cross-border hazard assessments, cross-border risk scenarios, cross-border vulnerability analysis, risk mapping, etc.;
Agreements, working procedures, methodologies, etc., required to establish a functioning cross-border network of competent authorities at national and sub-national level for specific risks;
Open source IT platforms for data/information-sharing, including, where relevant, common methodologies on disaster loss data collection across borders;
Specific cross-border action plans for the management of cross-border risks identified in joint risk assessments.
Priority 2: Enhancing cross-border emergency management
The need for collaboration in the field of disaster management arises when capacities of affected regions and communities are exceeded and assistance from bordering communities is required. Especially in border areas, assistance can be required from communities in neighbouring countries in order to provide citizens with quickly deployable, reliable and efficient emergency services.
In an initial phase, cross-border cooperation may focus on identifying and addressing legal and institutional bottlenecks that hinder mutual assistance. To this end, coherent and coordinated regional cross-border policy, in which the individuality and specific conditions of each border region within Europe and with the EU Neighbourhood are respected, is needed. Every region has its own specificities (e.g. population density, economic sectors, risks, specialised response capacities available) and needs. Thus, the approach to cross-border collaboration will also vary from region to region.
Once the benefits of cross-border collaboration are demonstrated, knowing and understanding each other’s civil protection and emergency management structures, work procedures and culture are essential for effective cross-border collaboration. In the medium-term, cross-border emergency management will be more successful if the cooperation is tested via regular and thorough operational exercises. Cross-border cooperation can be of particular value in preparing for risks with a potential high impact but a low likelihood of occurrence (Hi-Lo risks). These might be more efficient to prepare for jointly with neighbouring regions using one common planning instead of several separate plans.
Some regions have a long tradition of cross-border collaboration in disaster risk management and this has led to a structured exchange of knowledge and good practices over the years. This wealth of knowledge provides a solid base for cross-border collaboration that the UCPM can help disseminate and apply in other regions across Europe and its Neighbours.
In order to contribute to achieving Priority 2, this Call for Proposals will co-finance actions that aim to enhance cross-border disaster preparedness. Beneficiaries will be civil protection authorities and stakeholders in Member States, IPA beneficiaries not participating in the Mechanism, and/or European Neighbourhood Policy countries that share a border.
In particular, project activities and outputs should lead to the achievement of up to two (2) of the following outcomes:
2.1 The understanding of the institutional and legislative context of emergency management in neighbouring country/ies is enhanced;
2.2 Existing gaps to cross-border emergency response are identified;
2.3 Cross-border interoperability (e.g. of civil protection modules or other response capacities) is strengthened;
2.4 Cross-border response plans are developed/improved, including Host nation support;
2.5 Cross-border operational collaboration in disaster response is tested and strengthened.
Examples of project activities and outputs to be funded include, among others:
Analysis of legal/institutional aspects of cross-border cooperation and mutual assistance:
Gap and needs analyses for cross-border preparedness;
Host nation support guidelines with specific cross-border aspects;
Risk management capability assessments for cross-border areas;
Cross-border training programmes tailored to local/regional needs;
Agreements and memoranda of understanding regarding cooperation and mutual assistance in emergency management;
Technical specifications for development or enhancement of cross-border communication tools (e.g. radio communication) ;
Design and realisation of joint cross-border small-scale exercises for previously identified risks."

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
In order to contribute to achieving the above general objective, proposals are invited to focus on one of the following call priorities (specific objectives).
Specific objective 1: Integration of climate projections into disaster risk management
Climate change has become one of the key drivers of disaster risk. Therefore, in order to be effective and sustainable, planning for disaster risk management must take proper consideration of projected impacts of climate change over the next few decades. The starting point is to incorporate climate change scenarios into risk assessments, which underpin all strategies for disaster risk reduction and preparedness. While there have been clear advances in disaster risk assessment methodologies in Europe, experience shows that integration of the long-term impacts of climate change into risk assessments remains a challenge.[1][SR(1] [GV2] For instance, in many cases the time scale used for national risk assessments is too short to inform long-term investments with respect to climate risks. In other cases the estimated impacts and likelihoods of certain risks are based on historical data only and do not integrate climate scenarios. An additional challenge is assessing the cascading effects and interaction of climate change-related risks in a multi-hazard risk assessment.[2] Recent advances have led to the creation of new models that use climate and disaster data. The next step should be to turn the available data into a type of information that can inform decision-making.
In order to contribute to achieving the above specific objective, this Call for Proposals will co-finance activities that aim to facilitate and promote the use of long-term climate change projections and scenarios in disaster risk assessment and planning. In particular, project activities and outputs should lead to the development of one of the following outcomes:
Risk assessments taking into account climate change impacts (10-20 years)[3]
Workflow and procedures for the management (including collection, validation and analysis) of disaster loss data
Strategies and/or action plans for cross-border disaster risk management integrating projected climate change impacts
Macro-regional/national/regional risk assessments integrating climate change projections (including Na-Tech risks, cascading effects, etc.)
Examples of outputs to be funded include:
Need assessment of risk data end users ;
Open source IT platforms (e.g. decision-making support tools);
Analytical products (e.g. risk maps, scenarios, risk atlas, etc.).
Risk assessment reports
Disaster risk management plans
Specific objective 2: Development of climate-resilient infrastructure
Increasing the resilience of infrastructure, ecosystems and cultural heritage to climate change is an essential element for effective disaster prevention. This need has been recognised for the European Structural and Investment Funds 2021-2027 where the ‘climate-proofing’ of investments with a duration of more than 5 years will be required[4]. While actual investments in infrastructure and works are not eligible under this Call for Proposals, funding can finance preparatory work for investments in the resilience of existing public infrastructure as well as for new preventive infrastructure. Incorporating nature- or ecosystem-based solutions is encouraged given their cost-effectiveness and multiple co-benefits of these approaches.
In order to contribute to achieving the above specific objective, this Call will co-finance actions that aim to integrate climate resilience information in the development/retrofitting of public infrastructure. In particular, project activities and outputs should lead to the development of one of the following outcomes:
Methodologies to assess vulnerability of critical infrastructure to climate-related hazards;
Assessments of vulnerable infrastructure (including natural and cultural heritage assets) in areas at high risk to climate hazards;
Proposals for investment projects aiming to retrofit (including building back better) public infrastructure to make it climate resilient;
Preliminary studies (including cost-benefit analyses) for risk reduction structural investments (including consideration of ecosystem-based approaches).
Examples of outputs to be funded include:
Inventory of vulnerable infrastructure in high-risk areas (incl. natural and cultural heritage assets);
Results framework of proposed investment plan;
Design/plans for structural prevention investments for public infrastructure;
Cost-benefit analyses for investments (incl. consideration of ecosystem based approaches);
Feasibility studies for prevention/risk reduction investments;
Project proposals for structural prevention investments (including with consideration of ecosystem-based approaches).
For an example of a logical framework including illustrative outcomes, outputs and deliverables please refer to Annex I. General objectives, specific objectives (Call Priorities) and outcomes are pre-defined in this Call for Proposals. Each proposal must define work packages, outputs and deliverables that contribute to the Call’s specific and general objectives. Furthermore, outcomes, work packages, outputs and deliverables described in the proposals should be linked through a logical, result-driven chain and should demonstrate how the proposed action will contribute to achieving either specific objective 1 or 2.
Ideally, proposed projects should be complementary and take stock of, or build upon prior achievements in the field, including disaster risk reduction actions carried out by the EU or the Member States.

","Research and Innovation action
","10 December 2014
","08 September 2015","Scope:
Specific challenge: Agriculture generates co-products, by-products and waste streams that are currently not properly taken care of both in environmental and economic terms.
In plant production (e.g. from arable, horticulture, fruit, wine, grassland sectors and agro-forestry systems), losses take place at the farm and post-harvest levels and also down the chain at the level of the retail sector. Co-products or by-products are generated, for instance in the wine sector, which require sustainable use. Straw has been given significant attention in the last years as biomass feedstock and potential trade-offs with its relevance for soil improvement need to be considered.
In livestock production, manure, litter and other effluents management are a challenge, in particular in industrial production systems. While these effluents can be used as fertiliser, they can also be sources of bio-energy or valuable bio-products. The impacts on the environment, with emissions to the air, soil and water need to be evaluated. It is important to consider the whole effluent chain to avoid pollution swapping and health issues, due to possible transmission of pathogens.
Beyond reduction and recycling of agricultural waste, co-products and by-products, there may be opportunities for new processes enabling innovative uses of these materials, also outside the agricultural sector.
Scope: Proposals should evaluate existing techniques and develop new and innovative approaches for efficient use of agricultural waste, co-products and by-products, thereby contributing to the creation of sustainable value chains in the farming and processing sectors (including the organic sector). A range of sector-specific case studies (in terms of sources of waste and uses as well as geographic coverage) should serve to test and take up proposed approaches and technologies. Research and innovation efforts should address crop co-products/by-products/waste as well as manure/effluents.
On straw and other crop residues (including in mixture with manure), proposals should develop environmental safeguards such as sustainable extraction rates as well as guidance on optimal use of crop residues (in particular straw) for soil improvement, taking into account the need to maintain soil organic matter levels, and on farming practices to harvest and handle crop residues for alternative purposes.
As regards manure and effluents, proposals should address some or all of the following areas:
nutrient, energy and biochemical recovery from manure and other effluents;
improved knowledge on the environmental impact of manure and other effluents, further developing measurements and good manufacturing practices, minimising impacts on water and air quality (emissions and odours);
sanitary implications of pathogens that can be transmitted from manure and possible control options;
management chains, from processing to transport and application.
Involvement of industry (including strong participation from SMEs) should be ensured and pilot and/or demonstration activities should be performed. Knowledge platforms should be established. In line with the objectives of the EU’s strategy for international cooperation in research and innovation and in particular with the implementation of the EU-China dialogue, proposals are encouraged to include third country participants, especially those established in China[1]. Proposals should fall under the concept of 'multi-actor approach'[2]. This action allows for the provision of financial support to third parties in line with conditions set out in Part K of the General Annexes.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU in the range of EUR 7 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Proposals are requested to foresee close interaction with the other proposals selected for funding through creation of a joint stakeholder platform and other joint structures.
Expected impact:
Increased awareness and dialogue across sectors on availability, needs and options for smart use of agricultural waste, by-and co-products through creation of joint stakeholders platform and other joint structures.
Improved resource efficiency through reduction of waste and improved waste management in primary production.
Increased opportunities for valorisation of waste, by-and co-products resulting in environmental and economic benefits for the farming sector (e.g. development of new products and processes).
Enhanced competitiveness through more varied and/or new types of sources for bio-products and bio-energy in the agro-food (conventional and organic) and bioeconomy sectors.
Improved soil quality and crop productivity – through an optimal use of crop waste (taking into account the need to maintain soil organic matter levels) and nutrient recovery.
Improved water quality – reducing pollution and eutrophication of ground waters, and thus indirectly marine waters.
Improved air quality – by reducing livestock emissions.
Progress towards regulatory and standard development, in particular with respect to environmental protection and food safety.
Type of action: Research and innovation actions
[1]     This is without prejudice to the general rules on the funding of legal entities from third-countries, as set in part A of the General Annex.
[2] The multi-actor approach aims at more demand-driven innovation through the genuine and sufficient involvement of various actors (end-users such as farmers/farmers' groups, advisors, enterprises,  etc.) all along the project from participation in the planning of work and experiments, their execution up until the dissemination of results and the possible demonstration phase. The adequate choice of key actors with complementary types of knowledge (scientific and practical) should be reflected in the description of the project proposals and result in a broad implementation of project results. The multi-actor approach is more than a strong dissemination requirement or what a broad range of stakeholders can deliver: it should be illustrated with a sufficient quantity and quality of knowledge exchange activities and a clear role for the different actors in the work. This should generate innovative solutions that are more likely to be applied thanks to the cross-fertilisation of ideas between actors, the co-creation and the generation of co-ownership for eventual results. A multi-actor project needs to take into account how the objectives and planning of the project proposal are targeted to needs/problems and opportunities of end-users, as well as complementarity with existing research. Facilitation between actors and openness to involving additional players/groups of players during the project, for instance relevant EIP operational groups, is strongly recommended.

","Research and Innovation action
","11 December 2013
","16 September 2014","Scope:
Specific challenge: The rising demands of a growing world population for food, water, materials and energy will put increasing pressures on land use, water resources and ecosystems. Increased energy use leads to increased demands for cooling water for thermal power plants. Climate mitigation options such as biomass production for energy (biofuels) might also lead to increased land and water demands. Increased food and feed demand will put increasing pressures on land (e.g. deforestation leading to more greenhouse gas emission) and water resources. Such pressures will be compounded by the impacts of climate change which are likely to further modify the availability and suitability of these resources as well as affect agricultural productivity.
Tools to help explore options for low-carbon pathways, such as climate-energy models, currently lack a comprehensive integration of land-use and water systems, leading to an incomplete picture of the interactions between competing demands and the future viability and costs of adaptation and mitigation options as well as the environmental protection and agricultural challenges.
Despite considerable progress over the past ten years, the forecasting of natural water cycle variability and extreme weather events in the short and medium term still suffers from severe limitations. Improved understanding of the impacts of climate change on the hydrological cycle is necessary in order to better inform decision makers and ensure sustainable water supply and management of water systems, and quality of water bodies, in the EU.
Scope: Proposals shall address the following issues.
Water cycle under future climate:
Proposals should aim to: 
maximise the reliability of projections of precipitation (average, distribution, frequency, intensity) and couple them with water cycle variability at local/regional scales in Europe, over various timescales;
improve the short-to-medium term forecasting of related extreme events, integrating, where possible, information from available data sources;
assess the impacts of weather extremes as well as the wider impacts of climate change on the different components of the water cycle in terms of quantity and quality;
develop risk management strategies and adaptation options for extreme weather and other climate change-related threats at the appropriate scale(s) (local, regional and continental), taking into consideration the role and involvement of the relevant stakeholders, and potentially putting emphasis on highly vulnerable water resources of strategic importance.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 6 and 8 million (or more) would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected impact: 
More efficient management of water resources in Europe due to better knowledge of the water cycle under the future climate. Contribution to management planning across the EU in support of the Blueprint to safeguard Europe's water resources and the EU Climate Change Adaptation Strategy and the relevant priority areas of the EIP 'Water'. Contribution in the longer-term to the development of reliable climate services in relation to the water cycle.

","15 March 2016
","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Despite a recent trend for the research and innovation performance of individual countries in the EU to converge, sharp differences among Member States still remain. These disparities are due to, among other reasons, the insufficient critical mass of science and lack of centres of excellence having sufficient competence to engage countries and regions strategically in a path of innovative growth, building on newly developed capabilities. Moreover, by putting national budgets under constraint, the ongoing financial crisis is threatening to widen gaps. Exploiting the potential of Europe's talent pool by maximising and spreading the benefits of research and innovation across the Union is vital for Europe's competitiveness and its ability to address societal challenges in the future. This could help countries and regions that are lagging behind in terms of research and innovation performance to attain a competitive position in the global value chains.
Teaming will address this challenge by supporting the creation of new centres of excellence or upgrading the existing ones in low R&I performing countries, building on partnerships between leading scientific institutions and partner institutions in low R&I performing countries, that display the willingness to engage together on this purpose.
Scope:
Successful applicants under topic WIDESPREAD-1-2014: Teaming, of the call H2020-WIDESPREAD-2014 have received a grant to produce an extensive, detailed and robust Business Plan within a timeframe of 12 months for the setting-up/upgrading of a Centre of Excellence. This Business Plan is expected to be submitted in form of a proposal for Teaming Phase 2, as explained in detail further below.
This proposal (Business Plan) should demonstrate the potential of the future Centre to develop new (or connect effectively with existing) regional cluster formation and the prospects of the hosting country/region to provide an innovation friendly environment. The proposal has to include a letter of commitment (a template will be provided by the Commission in due time) from the interested national/regional authorities or other private sources to commit financial resources (e.g. resources coming from the European Structural and Investment Funds or Instrument for Pre-accession Assistance (IPA II) funds as appropriate) for implementing the future Centre, in particular regarding investment in infrastructure and equipment. A properly functioning service-oriented administration that is able to provide the human resources needed to absorb the research and innovation potential of the new/upgraded Centre should be demonstrated.
The proposal (Business Plan) should:
- Illustrate the scientific and innovation potential of the future Centre of Excellence
- Demonstrate the growth potential of the Centre of Excellence for the benefit of the country or region
- Elaborate on the structure of the partnership and on the strong engagement of the partners
- Demonstrate how the newly established/upgraded Centre will have full autonomy in decision making
- Elaborate on the steps that will be taken towards eventual long term self-sustainability
Procedure for Teaming Phase 2: In the context of the Framework Partnership Agreements awarded under topic WIDESPREAD-1-2014: Teaming, of the call H2020-WIDESPREAD-2014, a Specific Grant Agreement (SGA) will be awarded on the basis of a call for proposals open to all the above mentioned grant holder consortia for which this type of activity is already included in the FPA action plan (in accordance with the procedure established in art. 2.2 of the FPA).
Applicants to the Teaming Phase 2 call for proposals are invited to submit as a proposal, the Business Plan produced as main deliverable of the grant awarded under topic WIDESPREAD-1-2014: Teaming, of the call H2020-WIDESPREAD-2014.
Following the evaluation of the submitted Teaming Phase 2 proposals, the Commission will enter into a Specific Grant Agreement with the highest ranked proposals to provide substantial support for the start-up and implementation phase of the future Centre. This will cover mainly administrative and operational costs as well as personnel costs of the future Centre of Excellence. While the action does not focus on equipment and consumables, these could be accepted if they constitute only a minor part of the total Horizon 2020 funding requested and may be deemed necessary to fulfil the action's specific scope and objective.
For grants awarded under this topic the following cost categories will be ineligible costs:
- infrastructure costs.
The respective option of Article 6.5.C of the Model Grant Agreement will be applied. Such costs are expected to be supported by other types of funding, including where relevant by the European Structural and Investment Funds (ESIF) or the Instrument for Pre-accession Assistance (IPA II) funds.
The duration of a Teaming Phase 2 project will be between 5 to 7 years.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of EUR 15 million, would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting lower amounts.
Expected Impact:
The creation of new (or significant upgrades of existing) Centres of Excellence in ""Widening"" Countries through the Teaming partnerships is expected to:
- Increase their scientific capabilities and enable them to engage in a strategic growth path pointing to long-term opportunities for economic development. Potential links to innovative clusters would be an asset.
- Through improved scientific capabilities allow these countries to improve their chances to seek competitive funding in international fora (including the EU Framework Programmes).
- Over the medium to long term achieve a measurable and significant improvement in the research and innovation culture (as shown through indicators such as research intensity, innovation performance, values and attitudes towards research and innovation) of those countries.
The potential impact of the new/upgraded Centre of Excellence in terms of sustained excellence should be reinforced through projected measurable key performance and output related indicators.
Benefits will also accrue to the institutions from the more intensive research and innovation performers, in terms of access to new research avenues, creativity and the development of new approaches, as well as a source for increased mobility (inwards and outwards) of qualified scientists."

Teaming will support the creation of new centres of excellence or upgrading the existing ones in low R&I performing countries, building on partnerships between leading scientific institutions and partner institutions in low R&I performing countries, that display the willingness to engage together for this purpose.
Scope:
Teaming involves in principle, two (2) parties:
(1) The main applicant organisation (the coordinator) established in a ""Widening"" country that must be either a national/regional authority or a research funding agency or a university or a research organisation.
(2) A university or research organisation with an international reputation in research and innovation excellence.
The proposal for Teaming Phase 2 must:
- Illustrate the scientific and innovation potential of the future Centre of Excellence
- Demonstrate the growth potential and expected socio-economic outreach of the Centre of Excellence for the benefit of the country or region
- Elaborate on the structure of the partnership and on the strong engagement of the partners
- Demonstrate how the newly established/upgraded Centre will have full autonomy in decision making. In particular, the Centre of Excellence should have the maximum degree of autonomy in terms of taking its own decisions, being in legal, administrative, operational, personnel and academic matters. The Centre should be able to set and pay competitive salaries for its personnel.
- Elaborate on the steps that will be taken to ensure long term self-sustainability after the end of the Horizon 2020 project.
- Propose a robust human resource strategy (also encouraging gender equality), ensuring appropriate administrative and management capacities for the effective and efficient running of the Centre of Excellence.
- Include the letter(s) of commitment for complementary funding from the interested national/regional authorities or other private sources to commit financial resources (e.g. resources coming from the European Structural and Investment Funds or Instrument for Pre-accession Assistance (IPA II) funds as appropriate) for implementing the future Centre, in particular regarding investment in infrastructure and equipment. The letter(s) of Commitment for complementary funding (a template will be provided by the Commission in due time) of the project will be an integral part of the evaluation of the proposal taking into consideration:
the nature of the commitment,
the legal form of the commitment (what kind of legal scheme supports the financial commitment),
the specific amount of the commitment and its expected impact on the establishment of the centre (the total amount of the complementary funding must be at least at the same level or more than the total Horizon 2020 funding requested),
the level of certainty that the relevant funds would be indeed available to that specific Centre.
How the complementary funding will be spent during the project has to be explained in detail in the proposal, both in the budget table of Part A as well as with a clear and detailed cost breakdown of the activities funded in Part B.
Procedure for Teaming Phase 2:
Teaming Phase 2 is a restricted call open only to:
a. Applicants successfully funded under the topic WIDESPREAD-04-2017: Teaming Phase 1.
b. Applicants who have concluded a Framework Partnership Agreement under the topic WIDESPREAD-1-2014: Teaming, of the call H2020-WIDESPREAD-2014 but have not concluded a Specific Grant Agreement under the topic WIDESPREAD-01-2016-2017: Teaming Phase 2.
For both points a. and b. above, in order not to put in doubt the result of the initial evaluation (Teaming Phase 1), the internationally leading (""advanced"") institution(s) partners in the proposal must remain the same as in Phase 1.
A change of the partners from the widening country for Phase 2 is only allowed in clear-cut cases for instance where there might be a conflict of interest or a new legal entity for the Centre of Excellence is created. A detailed explanation for such a change has to be elaborated as part of the proposal for Phase 2.
Successful applicants under topic WIDESPREAD-1-2014: Teaming, of the call H2020-WIDESPREAD-2014 and topic WIDESPREAD-04-2017: Teaming Phase 1 of the call H2020-WIDESPREAD-2016-2017 have received a grant to produce an extensive, detailed and robust Business Plan within a timeframe of 12 months for the setting-up/upgrading of a Centre of Excellence. Based on the business plan developed during Phase 1, applicants are expected to submit a separate proposal for Teaming Phase 2. The proposal is expected to reflect all key elements of the business plan.
Nevertheless, it is emphasised that the Business Plan is the deliverable of Teaming Phase 1 and will not be subject to evaluation under Phase 2 (neither it will be made available to evaluators).
Applicants to this call will have to submit a proposal, following the template that will be made available to applicants through the submission tool. The submitted proposals under this restricted call will undergo an independent evaluation, and those selected for funding will be awarded a CSA grant (Teaming Phase 2).
This new grant for Teaming Phase 2 will provide substantial support for the start-up and implementation phase of the future Centre of Excellence. This will cover mainly administrative and operational costs as well as personnel costs of the future Centre of Excellence. While the action does not focus on equipment and consumables, these could be accepted if they constitute only a minor part of the total Horizon 2020 funding requested and may be deemed necessary to fulfil the action's specific scope and objective.
It is to be noted, that Horizon 2020 under the Teaming action will not support infrastructure costs associated with the new or upgraded centre. Such costs are expected to be supported by other types of funding, including where relevant by the European Structural and Investment Funds (ESI Funds) or the Instrument for Pre-accession Assistance (IPA II) funds.
For grants awarded under this topic and type of action the following cost categories will be ineligible costs:
- infrastructure costs.
The respective option of Article 6.5.C of the Model Grant Agreement will be applied. Such costs are expected to be supported by other types of funding, including where relevant by the European Structural and Investment Funds (ESI Funds) or the Instrument for Pre-accession Assistance (IPA II) funds.
The duration of a Teaming Phase 2 project will be between 5 to 7 years.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of EUR 15 million, would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting lower amounts.
Expected Impact:
The creation of new (or significant upgrades of existing) Centres of Excellence in ""Widening"" Countries through the Teaming partnerships is expected to:
- increase the scientific capabilities of these countries and enable them to engage in a strategic growth path pointing to long-term opportunities for economic development.
- through improved scientific capabilities allow these countries to improve their chances to seek competitive funding in international fora (including the EU Framework Programmes).

- reinforce the potential impact of the new/upgraded Centre of Excellence in terms of sustained excellence through projected measurable key performance and output related indicators.
It should be explained how the leading scientific institutions in the partnership will contribute in terms of provision of access to new research avenues, creativity and the development of new approaches, as well as acting as a source for increased mobility (inwards and outwards) of qualified scientists.
The benefits for the internationally leading scientific institutions and the way they would materialise through the partnership should be substantiated.

","27 October 2015
","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
The importance of urban areas in contributing to economic growth and innovation as well as in tackling social and environmental challenges is recognised by European policy agendas and beyond. Strong evidence exists that the largest urban areas are developing into 'global cities as knowledge hubs' that function in the worldwide networks of economic activities and innovation, communication as well as mobility and attract human capital. However, city regions in the Widening countries are facing specific challenges. For instance, the processes of severe regional polarisation and population shrinkage are hindering the development of many city regions into knowledge hubs in these countries. At the same time, there are huge possibilities of improvement for the Widening countries based on active collaboration with innovative urban regions of higher performing countries. Also other global megatrends such as demographic and climate change will have more severe negative impacts on urban regions in the Widening countries, especially in Eastern Europe, whereas city regions in Western and Northern parts of the Union will be less affected. In order to respond to these challenges, actors from the Widening countries should be actively involved in relevant R&I networks and activities having a strong policy-informing ambition.
Following the implementation of the actions foreseen by the Commission’s Communication on Joint Programming to tackle Europe’s major societal challenges of 2008, the Competitiveness Council has launched altogether ten Joint Programming Initiatives so far, among which is the Joint Programming Initiative ‘Urban Europe Global Urban Challenges, Joint European Solutions’ (JPI Urban Europe)[1].
This initiative enhances the knowledge and capacities in order to support urban transition towards sustainability in Europe and beyond. In doing so, it develops innovative solutions and reduces the fragmentation of urban-related research and innovation funding as well as builds critical mass and visibility. Several Council Conclusions on Joint Programming[2] invite the Commission to support JPIs via Coordination and Support Actions.
Scope:
Proposals should contribute to achieving an increased participation of countries and actors from the Widening countries in the JPI Urban Europe[3]. The proposals should also build on the coordination action ‘BOOST – Cooperation in Urban Science, Technology and Policy’ in support to the JPI Urban Europe that is expected to result in a Strategic Research and Innovation Agenda (SRIA) and in a related Implementation Plan[4]. Proposals should focus on actions enabling the JPI members to carry out activities foreseen in the Implementation Plan, for instance, by favouring the alignment of these activities to the SRIA. Moreover, proposals should support alignment of national research as well as enable evidence-based policy-making and effective cross-policy actions, and investigate novel forms of the SRIA implementation such as collaborations with other JPIs or research infrastructures, development of funding synergies with the European Structural and Investment Funds and so on. Finally, proposals should further strengthen the positioning of the JPI Urban Europe in the context of existing national and European activities by ensuring coherence with other relevant initiatives. Proposals should also enhance the international dimension of the JPI.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU in the range of EUR 1.25 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
Increased country participation of the JPI Urban Europe from the Widening countries by relationship building with actors, and by ensuring that the SRIA properly addresses the specific priorities and needs of these countries.
Improved overall uptake of the SRIA in national programmes and activities through alignment.
Contribution to the development of specific instruments for the SRIA implementation such as urban observatories or data warehouses, and involving actors from the Widening countries in these developments.
Improved professionalization of the programme management including knowledge exchange, capitalization of generated knowledge as well as implementation of new innovative solutions and concepts.
Enhanced positioning of the JPI Urban Europe in terms of research approach, research areas and instruments in the context of existing national and European activities and beyond including the outreach to cities, city networks and other urban actors.
Increased evidence-base for policy-making aimed at key EU priorities.

","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
In tackling societal challenges in the area of sustainable urbanisation, fragmented national research and innovation programmes represent an obstacle for European collaboration. In some countries, the situation has led to an underrepresentation of such countries in transnational collaboration. The different national research and innovation systems, approaches and instruments in these countries also add to the challenge. Furthermore, urban policy-making is often hampered by the limited cross-sector cooperation which does not allow a strong policy support that is based on scientific evidence.
Following the implementation of the actions foreseen by the Commission’s Communication on Joint Programming to tackle Europe’s major societal challenges of 2008, the Competitiveness Council has launched altogether ten Joint Programming Initiatives so far, among which is the Joint Programming Initiative ‘Urban Europe - Global Urban Challenges, Joint European Solutions’ (JPI Urban Europe)[1]. The initiative enhances the knowledge and capacities to support urban transition towards sustainability in Europe and beyond. In doing so, it develops innovative solutions and reduces the fragmentation of urban-related research and innovation funding as well as builds critical mass and visibility. Several Council Conclusions on Joint Programming[2] invite the Commission to support JPIs via Coordination and Support Actions.
The development of the JPI Urban Europe is driven by a strong group of countries but as to the overall country participation, the initiative is seeking to widen the participation. Although efforts are taken by the JPI Urban Europe in this sense, the results can only be expected in a longer-term as this challenge is of the structural nature.
The use of the European Structural and Investment Funds (ESI Funds) is seen as an essential element to strengthen the implementation of new urban solutions and concepts in Europe. The Urban Agenda[3] sets out a policy agenda for this and for EU urban policy in the wider sense. Many smart specialisation strategies include urban and smart cities related priorities and chart out the use of ERDF funding to develop and test new solutions for them. The Urban Innovative Actions identify and test innovative solutions for sustainable urban development.[4] Also the JPI Urban Europe aims to create, validate and demonstrate knowledge and solutions. The ESI Funds could provide for both investments and implementation support. The challenge is how to create synergies, complementarities and coherence as well as alignment between the activities of the JPI Urban Europe and other existing resources such as the ESI Funds.
The outreach and opening of the JPI Urban Europe to third country partners is increasingly raising interest among the latter. Building on this momentum, the challenge is to further enhance the opening of the JPI to international cooperation and thus contribute to creating a coherent European Research Area that is open to international cooperation in the field of sustainable urban development. The challenge is how to consolidate the alignment of national, EU and international research and innovation programmes, which is one of the key objectives of Joint Programming Initiatives. In that regard, there is also a need to support the post-2015 sustainable development agenda, in particular the Sustainable Development Goal on sustainable cities and urban settlements[5], building on related international activities taking place at United Nations level.
Scope:
Proposals should aim to implement a solid opening-up strategy of the JPI Urban Europe, for enlarging participation of more European partner countries getting involved in the JPI initiative, including from Widening countries, and to further enhancing the commitment and broader participation of countries. Proposals should build on the coordination action ‘EXPAND – Enhancing co-creation in JPI Urban Europe through widening Member State and stakeholder participation’[6] that is expected to establish a Stakeholder Involvement Platform for the widening of participation and capacity building in terms of countries, regions, stakeholders and urban actors. In that regard, proposals should ensure the sustainability of the Stakeholder Involvement Platform. Proposals should engage a wide variety of countries in the activities of the JPI Urban Europe with the support of existing complementary resources such as the ESI Funds. In doing so, the proposal should build on the pilot activities implemented[7] and establish further test beds for new instruments and for scaling up innovative solutions. Proposals should further professionalise the JPI Urban Europe programme management and further diversify various instruments for creating scientific evidence, innovations and the impact. Proposals should support the strategic processes of the JPI Urban Europe beyond 2020 and also establish mechanisms for the implementation of the future internationalisation strategy of the JPI Urban Europe[8] that is under preparation. In doing so, proposals should investigate activities to align with and support the post-2015 sustainable development agenda, in particular, the Sustainable Development Goal on sustainable cities and urban settlements.
All participants in proposals must be legal entities which finance or manage publicly funded national or regional programmes in the urban-related research and innovation domains or which are institutions mandated to represent the country/region in JPI Urban Europe activities.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of EUR 1.5 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting lower amounts.
Expected Impact:
- Increased scale and scientific quality of urban-related research and innovation activities as well as the overall coherence, complementarity and efficiency of the use of European research and innovation resources in this area including from Widening countries. In this context, relevant geographical spread is expected (medium to long term impact);
- Further professionalised programme management and more diversified instruments supporting implementation of the JPI Urban Europe Strategic Research and Innovation Agenda corresponding to the conditions of all types of countries as well as the JPI Urban Europe strategy development beyond 2020 (short to medium term impact);
- Increased synergies, complementarities and alignment between the strategies, activities and related resources of the JPI Urban Europe and other existing resources such as the ESI Funds, mostly present in Widening countries (medium term impact);
- More efficient valorisation and take-up of research findings both in terms of policy and innovation, including test beds for piloting new urban solutions (short to medium term impact);
- Improved exchange of know-how on urban R&I solutions across the EU, including Widening countries, and at global level (short to medium term impact);
- Strengthened role of the JPI Urban Europe for underpinning knowledge and scientific evidence for supporting the implementation of related EU policies, also in the context of the post-2015 sustainable development agenda (medium to long term impact);
- Enhanced positioning of the JPI Urban Europe as a privileged and attractive partner for global cooperation in the urban-related research and innovation (medium to long term impact).

","12 April 2017
","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Outstanding researchers can have a decisive and positive impact on the culture and performance of research institutions. Yet issues such as the availability of research funding, institutional rigidities and access to resources can hamper the mobility of such leaders to promising institutions, particularly in low R&I performing countries. ERA Chairs actions will address the specific challenge of creating the appropriate conditions and opportunities for high quality researchers and research managers to move and engage with willing institutions to improve the excellence of their research and thereby modify their research and innovation landscape.
Scope:
The ERA Chairs actions will support universities or research organisations with the objective of attracting and maintaining high quality human resources under the direction of an outstanding researcher and research manager (the ""ERA Chair holder"") and in parallel implementing the structural changes necessary to achieve excellence on a sustainable basis.
The scientific field can be any domain of research and innovation addressed under the Treaty, however it needs to be closely connected with the activities of the ERA Chair holder and fully capitalise on his/her presence and expertise.
Research organisations interested in establishing an ERA Chair shall submit a proposal based on a SWOT analysis, aimed at facilitating structural change in the institution and ensuring that the conditions are in place to foster excellent research. Proposals should include arrangements for compliance with ERA priorities[1] including the European Charter for Researchers & Code of Conduct for the Recruitment of Researchers[2], the gender equality in research teams and decision making bodies, better use of the installed research capacity (in particular of EU co-funded research infrastructures & facilities) and/or a description of the necessary investments in facilities and infrastructures. For the latter, interactions with national or regional authorities and other stakeholders to coordinate actions and mobilise support, including, where relevant, from European Structural and Investment Funds (ESIF) or Instrument for Pre-accession Assistance (IPA II) funds, are desirable. If relevant, any links with sustainable development objectives are to be outlined.
ERA Chair holders should be outstanding researchers and research managers in the given field of research, with a proven record of effective leadership. They should establish their own team and help the research organisation to significantly improve its research performance and to be more successful in obtaining competitive funding. The ERA Chair holder should have a position within the organisation/university, professor or similar, that will allow her/him to make appropriate resource allocation decisions, supervise team members and freely apply for research funding in order to raise the level of research excellence of the team and the institution. Proposals will need to describe clearly the intended remuneration package of the ERA Chair holder and the criteria on which the level of remuneration[3] has been established, as well as his/her roles, level of responsibility and obligations allowing for the determination of the feasibility of the ERA Chair tasks.
The position of the ERA Chair holder must be open to all EU and non-EU nationals. The appointment of an ERA Chair holder will be undertaken by the host institution at the beginning of the action and must follow an open, transparent and merit-based recruitment process that will be monitored by the European Commission.
It is expected that the Chair holder will commit him/herself for the full duration of the grant. The ERA Chair holder is to be appointed in a full-time position (permanent or non-permanent) in accordance with the national legislation of the institution hosting the grant.
The grant that can have a duration of five years maximum will cover the appointment of the ERA Chair holder and a number of team members (e.g. their salaries, recruitment costs[4], administrative costs, travel and subsistence costs).
The grant will also provide a contribution towards measures aimed at facilitating structural changes in the institution (e.g. costs for trainings, meetings, publications and managing IPR.While the action does not focus on equipment, these could be accepted if they constitute only a minor part of the total Horizon 2020 funding requested and may be deemed necessary to fulfil the action's specific scope and objective). Hence, the grant is not a measure to fund research per se and for grants awarded under this topic , the following cost categories will be ineligible costs:
- infrastructure costs;
- research costs (including consumables).
The respective option of Article 6.5.C of the Model Grant Agreement will be applied.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of EUR 2.5 million, would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting lower amounts.
Expected Impact:
Increased attractiveness of the institution, host region and country for internationally excellent and mobile researchers.
Increased research excellence of the institution in the specific fields covered by the ERA Chair holders.
Improved capability to compete successfully for internationally competitive research funding.
Institutional changes within the ERA Chair host institution to implement the European Research Area priorities, (including an open recruitment policy, gender balance, peer review, and innovative doctoral training).

","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
The specific challenge is to enhance networking activities between the research institutions of the Widening countries and internationally-leading counterparts at EU level. Driven by the quest for excellence, research intensive institutions tend to collaborate increasingly in closed groups, producing a crowding-out effect for a large number of promising institutions. This is the challenge that a specific Twinning action will try to address.
Scope:
Twinning aims at significantly strengthening a defined field of research in a university or research organisation from a Widening country by linking it with at least two internationally-leading research institutions from two different Member States or Associated Countries. Twinning will:
Enhance the scientific and technological capacity of the linked institutions with a principal focus on the university or research organisation from the Widening Country;
Help raise the research profile of the institution from the Widening country as well as the research profile of its staff.
Successful Twinning proposals will have to clearly outline the scientific strategy for stepping up and stimulating scientific excellence and innovation capacity in a defined area of research as well as the scientific quality of the partners involved in the twinning exercise. This scientific strategy should include arrangements for formulating new (or ongoing) joint research project(s) in the scientific area of choice and describe how Twinning will take this research to a new stage, by enlarging its scope and/or the research partnership. If relevant, any links with sustainable development objectives are to be outlined.
Such a strategy should include a comprehensive set of activities to be supported. These should include at least a number of the following: short term staff exchanges; expert visits and short-term on-site or virtual training; workshops; conference attendance; organisation of joint summer school type activities; dissemination and outreach activities.
A dedicated focus towards promoting the involvement of early stage researchers (as per the MSCA definition[1]) in the coordinating institution from the Widening country is expected. This should take the form of a dedicated work package in the proposal describing activities dedicated to early stage researchers from the coordinating institution that could include training, mentoring and networking measures within the Twinning exercise.
In general, costs relating to administration, networking, coordination, training, management, travel costs are acceptable under a Twinning project.
Therefore, for grants awarded under this topic and type of action the following cost categories will be ineligible costs:
- infrastructure costs;
- equipment;
- research costs (including consumables).
The respective option of Article 6.5.C of the Model Grant Agreement will be applied.
The duration of a Twinning project can be up to 3 years.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of EUR 0.8 million, would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting lower amounts.
Expected Impact:
- Increased research excellence of the coordinating institution in the particular field of research as a result of the twinning exercise.
- Enhancing the reputation, attractiveness and networking channels of the coordinating institution.
- Improved capability to compete successfully for national, EU and internationally competitive research funding.
- Illustrate quantitatively and qualitatively the expected potential impact of the twinning exercise within the coordinating institution (and possibly at regional/national level) based on indicators like expected future publications in peer reviewed journals, collaboration agreements with businesses, intellectual property, new innovative products or services.
- It should be explained how the leading scientific institutions in the partnership will contribute in terms of provision of access to new research avenues, creativity and the development of new approaches, as well as acting as a source for increased mobility (inwards and outwards) of qualified scientists.
- The benefits for the internationally leading scientific institutions and the way they would materialise through the partnership should be substantiated.
[1]Early stage researchers shall, at the time of recruitment by the host organisation, be in the first four years (full-time equivalent research experience) of their research careers and have not been awarded a doctoral degree.

","28 July 2016
","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Despite a recent tendency for the research and innovation performances of individual countries in the EU to converge, sharp differences among Member States still remain. These disparities are due to, among other reasons, the insufficient critical mass of science and lack of centres of excellence having sufficient competence to engage countries and regions strategically in a path of innovative growth, building on newly developed capabilities. Moreover, by putting national budgets under constraint, the ongoing financial crisis is threatening to widen gaps. Exploiting the potential of Europe's talent pool by maximising and spreading the benefits of research and innovation across the Union is vital for Europe's competitiveness and its ability to address societal challenges in the future. This could help countries and regions that are lagging behind in terms of research and innovation performance to attain a competitive position in the global value chains.
Teaming will address this challenge by supporting the creation of new centres of excellence or upgrading the existing ones in low R&I performing countries, building on partnerships between leading scientific institutions and partner institutions in low R&I performing countries, that display the willingness to engage together on this purpose.
Scope:
Teaming, will involve in principle, two (2) parties:
(1) The main applicant organisation (the coordinator) established in a ""Widening"" country (see section on specific eligibility criteria for more details) that must be either a national/regional authority or a research funding agency or a university or a research organisation. In case the coordinator organisation is not a public authority, it will need to provide a letter of intent (the Commission will provide a relevant template) to ensure the long-term nature and accountability of Teaming projects.
(2) A university or research organisation with an international reputation in research and innovation excellence.
Partner organisations will have to explain clearly their vision for the establishment of a new Centre of Excellence (or the upgrading of an existing one) that would be hosted in the ""Widening"" country. This will include details on the long-term science and innovation strategy of the future Centre, in particular, the detailed provisions for the good management of the project between the partners. Furthermore, proposers should include a clear analysis of how this strategy would fit broadly with the relevant Smart Specialisation Strategy of the Widening country, where relevant, or an equivalent growth strategy. In the case of an upgrade of an existing centre of excellence, additional information concerning organisation profile, activities and strategy of the centre should be provided.
Information for Teaming Phase 1:
Under Phase 1, successful applicants will receive a grant that will last for 12 months, to produce an extensive, detailed and robust Business Plan for the setting-up / upgrading of a Centre of Excellence.
Proposers will be asked to demonstrate within their (single) proposal two distinct, yet complementary aspects:
a long term vision, including a long term science and innovation strategy based on a SWOT analysis, for the new Centre of Excellence (or the upgrading of an existing one) that would be hosted in the Widening country.
a 12 month action aimed at producing a detailed and robust business plan for the setting-up/upgrading of the Centre of Excellence in line with the long term vision.
The Teaming proposal will need to demonstrate that the project is based on a true joint venture between the relevant partners from both parties. This long term joint venture cooperation is expected to continue also beyond the duration of the overall Teaming project, with the partners fully committed to continue supporting the new Centre in view of achieving sustainability in the long run and hopefully financial autonomy (also by successfully competing for European and international funding programmes).
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of EUR 0.40 million, would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting lower amounts.
Preliminary Information for Teaming Phase 2 (under WP 2018/19):
Once the 12 month CSA under Teaming Phase 1 is concluded, there will be a restricted call for the concrete implementation of the Business Plan, i.e. for the establishment of the new/upgraded centre (Teaming, Phase 2).
This call will be addressed to the participants successful in Phase 1 above, and to applicants who have concluded a Framework Partnership Agreement in the context of the call H2020-WIDESPREAD-2014 and have not concluded a Specific Grant Agreement for Teaming Phase 2.
The submitted proposals under this restricted call will undergo an independent evaluation, and those selected for funding will be awarded a CSA grant (Teaming Phase 2).
This new grant for Teaming Phase 2 will provide substantial support for the start-up and implementation phase of the future Centre of Excellence. This will cover mainly administrative and operational costs as well as personnel costs of the future Centre of Excellence. While the action does not focus on equipment and consumables, these could be accepted if they constitute only a minor part of the total Horizon 2020 funding requested and may be deemed necessary to fulfil the action's specific scope and objective.
It is to be noted, that Horizon 2020 under the Teaming action will not support infrastructure costs associated with the new or upgraded centre. Such costs are expected to be supported by other types of funding, including where relevant by the European Structural and Investment Funds (ESIF) or the Instrument for Pre-accession Assistance (IPA II) funds.
The duration of a Teaming Phase 2 project may be between 5 to 7 years.
Further explanations for Teaming Phase 2 will be given in the future Work Programme 2018-2019.
Expected Impact:
The creation of new (or significant upgrades of existing) Centres of Excellence in ""Widening"" Countries through the Teaming partnerships is expected to:
- increase their scientific capabilities and enable them to engage in a strategic growth path pointing to long-term opportunities for economic development. Potential links to innovative clusters would be an asset.
- through improved scientific capabilities allow these countries to improve their chances to seek competitive funding in international fora (including the EU Framework Programmes).
- over the medium to long term achieve a measurable and significant improvement in terms of research and innovation culture (as shown through indicators such as research intensity, innovation performance, values and attitudes towards research and innovation) of those countries.
The potential impact of the new/upgraded Centre of Excellence in terms of sustained excellence should be reinforced through projected measurable key performance and output related indicators.
Benefits will also accrue to the institutions from the more intensive research and innovation performers, in terms of access to new research avenues, increased creativity and development of new approaches, as well as a source for increased mobility (inwards and outwards) of qualified scientists."

","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
With adequate institutional support outstanding researchers can have a decisive and positive impact on the culture and performance of research institutions. Yet issues such as the availability of research funding, institutional rigidities and access to resources can hamper their mobility to promising institutions, particularly in low R&I performing countries. ERA Chairs actions will address the specific challenge of creating the appropriate conditions for high quality researchers and research managers to move and engage with institutions willing to achieve excellence in the scientific domain of choice and modify their research and innovation landscape.
Scope:
The ERA Chairs actions will support universities or research organisations with the objective of attracting and maintaining high quality human resources under the direction of an outstanding researcher and research manager (the ""ERA Chair holder"") and in parallel implement structural changes to achieve excellence on a sustainable basis.
The scientific field can be any domain of research and innovation addressed under the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union[1], however it needs to be closely connected with the activities of the ERA Chair holder and fully capitalise on his/her presence and expertise.
Research organisations interested in establishing an ERA Chair shall submit a proposal based on a strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats (SWOT) analysis, aimed at structural change in the institution and ensuring that the conditions are in place to foster excellent research. Proposals should include arrangements for compliance with ERA priorities[2] including the European Charter for Researchers & Code of Conduct for the Recruitment of Researchers[3], a description of the necessary investments in research projects, facilities and infrastructures and how those will be achieved as, for example, through the use of Cohesion Policy funds, and/ or a better use of the installed research capacity (in particular of EU co-funded research infrastructures & facilities). Proposals should outline how the proposed activities will positively induce a change in current practices.
ERA Chair holders should be excellent researchers and research managers in the given field of research, with a proven record of effective leadership. They should establish their own research team fully integrated in the coordinator's institution to significantly improve its research performance in the scientific domain of choice and to be more successful in obtaining competitive funding. The ERA Chair holder should have a position within the organisation/university, professor or similar, that will allow her/him to make appropriate resource allocation decisions, supervise team members and freely apply for research funding. A letter of the head of the institution clearly describing the intended remuneration package of the ERA Chair holder and the criteria on which the level of remuneration[4] has been established, as well as his/her roles, level of responsibility and obligations should be included within the proposal. This will allow for the determination of the commitment of the institution and feasibility of the ERA Chair tasks.
The position of the ERA Chair holder must be open to all EU and non-EU nationals but shall match the profile of an ""Established Researcher (R3)"" or ""Leading Researcher (R4)"" as set out in the European Framework for Research Careers [5]. Moreover, given the objectives of the action, internal mobility within the institution hosting the grant is excluded except in exceptional and duly justified cases. The appointment of an ERA Chair holder will be undertaken by the host institution at the beginning of the action and must follow an open, transparent and merit-based recruitment process that will be monitored by the European Commission.
It is expected that the Chair holder commits him/herself for the full duration of the grant. The ERA Chair holder is to be appointed in a full-time position (permanent or non-permanent) in accordance with the national legislation of the institution hosting the grant.
The grant that can have a duration of five years maximum will cover the appointment of the ERA Chair holder and a number of team members (e.g. their salaries, recruitment costs[6], administrative costs, travel and subsistence costs).
The grant will also provide a contribution towards measures aimed at facilitating structural changes in the institution (e.g. costs for trainings, meetings, publications and managing Intellectual Property Rights (IPR).While the action does not focus on equipment and consumables, these could be accepted if they constitute only a minor part of the total Horizon 2020 funding requested and are deemed necessary to fulfil the action's specific scope and objective). For grants awarded under this topic and type of action, the following cost categories will be ineligible costs:
- Infrastructure costs;
The respective option of Article 6.5.C of the Model Grant Agreement will be applied.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of EUR 2.5 million, would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting lower amounts.
Expected Impact:
- Institutional changes within the ERA Chair host institution allowing for its full participation in the European Research Area.
- Increased attractiveness of the institution for internationally excellent and mobile researchers (including a policy of compliance to the European Research Area priorities like (an open recruitment policy, gender balance, peer review and innovative doctoral training).
- Increased research excellence of the institution in the specific fields covered by the ERA Chair holders illustrated quantitatively and qualitatively through indicators such as expected future publications in peer reviewed journals, collaboration agreements with businesses, intellectual property, new innovative products or services.
- Improved capability to compete successfully for internationally competitive research funding.

","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
The specific challenge is to address networking gaps and deficiencies between the research institutions of the Widening countries and internationally-leading counterparts at EU level. Driven by the quest for excellence, research intensive institutions tend to collaborate increasingly in closed groups, producing a crowding-out effect for a large number of promising institutions. This is the challenge that a specific Twinning action will try to address.
Scope:
Twinning aims at significantly strengthening a defined field of research in a university or research organisation from a Widening country by linking it with at least two internationally-leading research institutions in other Member States or Associated Countries. Twinning will:
Enhance the S&T capacity of the linked institutions with a principal focus on the university or research organisation from the Widening Country;
Help raise the research profile of the institution from the Widening country as well as the research profile of its staff.
Successful Twinning proposals will have to clearly outline the scientific strategy for stepping up and stimulating scientific excellence and innovation capacity in a defined area of research as well as the scientific quality of the partners involved in the twinning exercise. If relevant, any links with sustainable development objectives are to be outlined.
Such a strategy should include a comprehensive set of measures to be supported. These should include at least a number of the following: short term staff exchanges; expert visits and short-term on-site or virtual training; workshops; conference attendance; organisation of joint summer school type activities; dissemination and outreach activities.
In general, costs relating to administration, networking, coordination, training, management, travel costs are acceptable under a Twinning project.
Therefore, for grants awarded under this topic the following cost categories will be ineligible costs:
- infrastructure costs;
- equipment;
- research costs (including consumables).
The respective option of Article 6.5.C of the Model Grant Agreement will be applied.
The duration of a Twinning project can be up to 3 years.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of EUR 1 million, would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting lower amounts.
Expected Impact:
Increased research excellence of the coordinating institution in the particular field of research as a result of the twinning exercise.
Enhancing the reputation, attractiveness and networking channels of the coordinating institution.
Improved capability to compete successfully for national, EU and internationally competitive research funding.
Illustrate quantitatively and qualitatively the expected potential impact of the twinning exercise within the coordinating institution (and possibly at regional/national level) based on indicators like expected future publications in peer reviewed journals, collaboration agreements with businesses, intellectual property, new innovative products or services.
Benefits will also accrue to the institutions from the more intensive research and innovation performers, in terms of access to new research avenues, creativity and the development of new approaches, as well as a source for increased mobility (inwards and outwards) of qualified scientists."

","single-stage
Deadline date","Scope:
Specific challenge: Despite its strengths, the European Research and Innovation landscape presents a lot of structural disparities, with research and innovation excellence concentrated in a few geographical zones. These disparities are due to, among other reasons, the insufficient critical mass of science and centres having sufficient competence to engage countries and regions strategically in a path of innovative growth, building on newly developed capabilities. This could help countries and regions that are lagging behind in terms of research and innovation performance reclaim their competitive position in the global value chains. Teaming will address this challenge by creating or upgrading such centres of excellence, building on partnerships between leading scientific institutions and low performing partners that display the willingness to engage together on this purpose.
Scope: Teaming, will involve in principle, two (2) parties: an institution of research and innovation excellence (public or private) or a consortium of such institutions and the participant organisation from a low performing Member State (for example a national or regional authority, or a research agency at national or regional level; the presence of a local partner research institution is encouraged as it could provide additional relevance to the teaming process). Both parties will be required to sign the grant agreement. The coordinator of the project should be the participant organisation from the low performing Member State. Teaming actions will be selected for funding through the following process:
Stage 1: Partner organisations will have to explain clearly their vision for the establishment of a new Centre of Excellence (or the upgrading of an existing one) that would be hosted in the low performing Member State or region involved. This will include details on the long-term science and innovation strategy of the future Centre, in particular, the detailed provisions for the good management of the project between the partners. Furthermore, proposers should include a clear analysis of how this strategy would fit with the relevant Smart Specialisation Strategy of the participating low performing Member State or region.    In the case of an upgrade of an existing centre of excellence (or a consortium of centres of excellence established in the same region), additional information concerning organisation profile, activities and strategy of the centre should be provided. Successful applicants will receive a grant to produce an extensive, detailed and robust Business Plan for the setting-up / upgrading of a Centre of Excellence.
The Business Plan should demonstrate the potential of the future Centre to develop new (or connect effectively with existing) regional cluster formation and the prospects of the hosting country/region to provide an innovation friendly environment. It has to include commitments from the interested national or regional authorities to commit financial resources (e.g. resources coming from the European Structural and Investment Funds) as appropriate, for implementing the future Centre, in particular regarding investment in infrastructure and equipment. A properly functioning service-oriented administration as well as an education and training system that is able to provide the human resources needed to absorb the innovation potential of the new research centre should be demonstrated. The duration of a typical first stage of a Teaming project will be 12 months.
Stage 2: All funded proposals of the first stage will automatically enter into the second stage of the competition that will involve an in-depth evaluation (by an international expert panel) of all submitted Business Plans. These will be evaluated in terms of content (scientific excellence), impact on innovation and quality of the proposed implementation plan. 
Following this evaluation and depending on available budget, the Commission will enter into a Grant agreement with the highest ranked proposals to provide further substantial support (administrative costs, salaries etc.) for the start-up and implementation phase of the future Centre. It is to be noted however, that Horizon 2020 will not support infrastructure or large equipment costs associated with the new or upgraded centre (as reflected above, such costs are expected to be supported by other types of funding, including where relevant by the European Structural and Investment Funds (ESIF)).[1] The duration of a typical second stage of a Teaming project will be 5-7 years.
The long-term cooperation between the Commission and the selected partner organisations that have been successful in Stage 1 will be formalised with a Framework Partnership Agreement (FPA). This agreement shall specify the common objectives, the nature of the specific actions planned and the general rights and obligations of each party. It is noted however, that the FPA will continue in Stage 2 only with those organisations that have received the highest ranking (through an evaluation by an international high-level expert panel) for their submitted Business Plans from Stage 1.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 0.2 and 0.5 million for Stage 1 and between EUR 15 and 20 million for Stage 2 would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected impact: Actions will lead to the creation of new (or significant upgrades of existing) Centres of Excellence in Member States and regions currently identified as low performers in terms of research and innovation, increasing on the one hand their scientific capabilities and on the other, enabling them to engage in a strategic growth path in terms of economic development. It is also expected that improved scientific capabilities will allow them to improve their chances to seek competitive funding in international fora (including the EU Framework Programmes). Over the medium to long term there will be a measurable and significant improvement in the research and innovation culture (as shown through indicators such as research intensity, innovation performance, enhanced strategy, values and attitudes towards research and innovation) within Member States currently with low R&I performance. These will be fostered through constructive and sustainable partnerships achieved between research and innovation-intensive institutions of excellence and the partnering organisation in the low performing Member State or region.  Benefits will also accrue to the institutions from the more intensive research and innovation performers, in terms of issues such as access to new research avenues, creativity and the development of new approaches, as well as a source for increased mobility (inwards and outwards) of qualified scientists.
Type of action: Framework Partnership Agreement and Coordination and Support Action funded by a specific grant awarded under the Framework Partnership Agreement.
The conditions related to this topic are provided in the general conditions for this call and in the General Annexes.
[1] Following an initial (minimum) three years' operating period, the Commission may consider to award “labels of excellence” to those newly established Centres that have met strict international standards through an independent international evaluation process (to be further organised by the Commission). There would however, be no additional EU funding involved. It should also be noted that this operation is not part of this Work Programme and Call."

The specific challenge is to enhance networking activities between the research institutions of the Widening countries and internationally-leading counterparts at EU level. Driven by the quest for excellence, research intensive institutions tend to collaborate increasingly in closed groups, producing a crowding-out effect for a large number of promising institutions. This is the challenge that a specific Twinning action will try to address.
Scope:
Twinning aims at significantly strengthening a defined field of research in a university or research organisation from a Widening country by linking it with at least two internationally-leading research institutions from two different Member States or Associated Countries. Twinning will:
1. Enhance the scientific and technological capacity of the linked institutions with a principal focus on the university or research organisation from the Widening Country;
2. Help raise the research profile of the institution from the Widening country as well as the research profile of its staff.
Successful Twinning proposals will have to clearly outline the scientific strategy for stepping up and stimulating scientific excellence and innovation capacity in a defined area of research as well as the scientific quality of the partners involved in the twinning exercise. This scientific strategy should include arrangements for formulating new (or ongoing) joint research project(s) in the scientific area of choice and describe how Twinning will take this research to a new stage, by enlarging its scope and/or the research partnership. If relevant, any links with sustainable development objectives are to be outlined.
Such a strategy should include a comprehensive set of activities to be supported. These should include at least a number of the following: short term staff exchanges; expert visits and short-term on-site or virtual training; workshops; conference attendance; organisation of joint summer school type activities; dissemination and outreach activities.
A dedicated focus towards promoting the involvement of early stage researchers (as per the MSCA definition[1]) in the coordinating institution from the Widening country is expected. This should take the form of a dedicated work package or task in the proposal describing activities dedicated to early stage researchers from the coordinating institution that could include training, mentoring and networking measures within the Twinning exercise, with a special focus on the promotion of gender equality among early stage researchers.
One of the lessons learned from previous calls and from the interim evaluation of Horizon 2020, is the lack of experience with regard to research management and administration in widening countries. That is why proposals should also focus on strengthening the research management and administration skills of the coordinating institution from the Widening country. This should take the form of a dedicated work package or task, placing emphasis to specific activities, in view of helping the staff of the coordinating institution to improve their proposal preparation and project management/administration skills. If not yet in place, setting up/upgrading a research management/administration unit within the coordinating institution would be beneficial. This will be achieved by fully utilising the experience and best practices of the internationally leading partners and is expected to be a concrete deliverable of the Twinning exercise.
In general, costs relating to administration, networking, coordination, training, management, travel costs are acceptable under a Twinning project. While the action does not focus on equipment and research costs, these could be accepted if they constitute only a minor part (up to 10%) of the total Horizon 2020 funding requested and are deemed necessary to fulfil the action's specific scope and objective.
Therefore, for grants awarded under this topic and type of action the following cost categories will be ineligible costs:
- infrastructure costs;
The respective option of Article 6.5.C of the Model Grant Agreement will be applied.
The duration of a Twinning project can be up to 3 years.
If the coordinating entity has already been funded (as a coordinator) under other Horizon 2020 Twinning calls, these projects need to be described in the proposal. In particular, proposers need to clearly demonstrate the added value and impact of the proposal in achieving the Twinning programme objectives, in comparison to the already funded Twinning project within the coordinating entity.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of EUR 0.9 million, would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting lower amounts.
Expected Impact:
- Increased research excellence of the coordinating institution in the particular field of research as a result of the twinning exercise.
- Enhancing the reputation, attractiveness and networking channels of the coordinating institution.
- Improved capability to compete successfully for national, EU and internationally competitive research funding.
- Illustrate quantitatively and qualitatively the expected potential impact of the twinning exercise within the coordinating institution (and possibly at regional/national level) based on indicators like expected future publications in peer reviewed journals, collaboration agreements with businesses, intellectual property, new innovative products or services.
- It should be explained how the leading scientific institutions in the partnership will contribute in terms of provision of access to new research avenues, creativity and the development of new approaches, as well as acting as a source for increased mobility (inwards and outwards) of qualified scientists.
- The benefits for the internationally leading scientific institutions and the way they would materialise through the partnership should be substantiated.
[1]Early stage researchers shall, at the time of recruitment by the host organisation, be in the first four years (full-time equivalent research experience) of their research careers and have not been awarded a doctoral degree. Full-time equivalent research experience is measured from the date when the researcher obtained the degree entitling him or her to embark on a doctorate, (either in the country in which the degree was obtained or in the country in which the researcher is recruited) even if a doctorate was never started or envisaged. Part-time research experience will be counted pro-rata."

A description of the necessary investments in research projects, facilities and infrastructures and how those will be achieved as, for example, through the use of Cohesion Policy funds, and/ or a better use of the installed research capacity (in particular of EU co-funded research infrastructures & facilities) should be made. Making full use of the latter (i.e. existing EU funded research infrastructure) will be an asset.

It is expected that the Chair holder commits him/herself for the full duration of the grant. The ERA Chair holder is to be appointed in a full-time position (permanent or non-permanent) in accordance with the national legislation of the institution hosting the grant.
Provisions should also be made in the proposal to ensure the sustainability of the action after the end of the Horizon 2020 funding. This should be demonstrated clearly in the proposal (e.g. through the inclusion of a sustainability plan). Concretely, proposals need to outline how the ERA Chair holder and his/her team will continue to contribute within the institution after the end of the Horizon 2020 project. In case this is not possible, an outline of transitional arrangements needs to be explained to ensure the work, progress and structural changes achieved will continue to be implemented in the future.
The grant that can have a duration of six years maximum will cover the appointment of the ERA Chair holder and a number of team members (e.g. their salaries, recruitment costs[6], administrative costs, travel and subsistence costs).

The respective option of Article 6.5.C of the Model Grant Agreement will be applied.
The duration of an ERA Chair project can be up to 6 years.
If the coordinating entity has already been funded under other Horizon 2020 ERA Chairs calls, these projects need to be described in the proposal. In particular, proposers need to clearly demonstrate the added value and impact of the proposal in achieving the ERA Chair programme objectives, in comparison to the already funded ERA Chair project within the coordinating entity.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of EUR 2.5 million, would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting lower amounts.
Expected Impact:
- Institutional changes within the ERA Chair host institution allowing for its full participation in the European Research Area.
- Increased attractiveness of the institution for internationally excellent and mobile researchers (including a policy of compliance to the European Research Area priorities like an open recruitment policy, gender balance, peer review and innovative doctoral training).
- Increased research excellence of the institution in the specific fields covered by the ERA Chair holders illustrated quantitatively and qualitatively through indicators such as expected future publications in peer reviewed journals, collaboration agreements with businesses, intellectual property, new innovative products or services.
- Improved capability to compete successfully for internationally competitive research funding.

","SME instrument phase 1
","26 November 2015
","09 November 2017","Specific Challenge:
SMEs play a crucial role in developing resource-efficient, cost-effective and affordable technology solutions to decarbonise and make more efficient the energy system in a sustainable way. They are expected to strongly contribute to one or a combination of more than one of the challenges outlined in the legal base of the Horizon 2020 Societal Challenge ‘Secure, Clean and Efficient Energy’[1], in particular with regard to:
Reducing energy consumption and carbon footprint by smart and sustainable use (including energy-efficient products and services as well as ‘Smart Cities and Communities’),
Low-cost, low-carbon electricity supply (including renewable energy as well as carbon capture and storage and re-use),
Alternative fuels and mobile energy sources,
A single, smart European electricity grid,
New knowledge and technologies, and
Robust decision making and public engagement.
Scope:
The SME instrument consists of three phases, including a coaching and mentoring service for beneficiaries. Participants can apply to phase 1 or directly to phase 2.
In phase 1, a feasibility study shall be developed in order to verify the technological/practical as well as economic viability of an innovation idea/concept with considerable novelty to the industry sector in which it is presented (new products, processes, design, services and technologies or new market applications of existing technologies). The activities could, for example, comprise risk assessment, market study, user involvement, Intellectual Property (IP) management[2],
innovation strategy development, partner search, feasibility of concept and the like to establish a solid high-potential innovation project aligned to the enterprise strategy and with a European dimension. Bottlenecks in the ability to increase profitability of the enterprise through innovation shall be detected and analysed during phase 1 and addressed during phase 2 to increase the return in investment in innovation activities. The proposal should contain an initial business plan based on the proposed idea/concept. It should outline the specifications of a more elaborate business plan, which is to be the outcome of the project, and the criteria for success.
Funding will be provided in the form of a lump sum of EUR 50.000. Projects should last around 6 months.
In phase 2, innovation projects[3]
will be supported that address the specific challenges identified and that demonstrate high potential in terms of company competitiveness and growth underpinned by a strategic business plan. Activities should focus on innovation activities such as demonstration, testing, prototyping, piloting, scaling-up, miniaturisation, design, market replication and the like aiming to bring an innovation idea (product, process, service etc.) to industrial readiness and maturity for market introduction, but may also include some research. For technological innovation, Technology Readiness Levels of 6 or above (or similar for non-technological innovations) are envisaged; please see part G of the General Annexes.
Proposals shall be based on an elaborate business plan. Particular attention must be paid to IP protection and ownership; applicants will have to present convincing measures to ensure the possibility of commercial exploitation ('freedom to operate').
Proposals shall contain a specification for the outcome of the project and criteria for success. They will include an explanation of how the results of the supported project are to be commercialised and of what kind of impact on the company is expected.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 0.5 and 2.5 million[4]
would allow phase 2 to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts (higher or lower). Projects should last between 12 and 24 months. [5]
Phase 3 of the SME Instrument aims to increase the economic impact of the funding provided by the SME Instrument phase 1&2 grants and by the business coaching. Phase 3 is not subsequent to phase 1 and/or 2, but provides specific support to SME instrument beneficiaries during and after phase 1 or 2.
All support under phase 3 of the SME instrument will be accessible through a single, dedicated entry point, which will serve as an information portal and a networking space.
This platform will offer access to two main strands of services:
Access to markets
Access to finance
In addition, phase 3 will create opportunities for partnering, networking and training, which are set out in the Dedicated Support Actions at the end of this call.
SME Instrument beneficiaries are also offered dedicated business innovation coaching and mentoring support. This service is facilitated by the Enterprise Europe Network and delivered by a dedicated coach through consultation and signposting to the beneficiaries. The coaches are recruited from a central database managed by the Commission and have all fulfilled stringent criteria with regards to business experience and competencies.
Throughout the three phases of the instrument, the Network will complement the coaching support by providing access to its innovation and internationalisation service offering. This could include, for example, depending on the need of the SME, support in identifying growth potential, developing a growth plan and maximising it through internationalisation; strengthening the leadership and management skills of individuals in the senior management team and developing in-house coaching capacity; developing a marketing strategy or raising external finance.
Expected Impact:
Enhancing profitability and growth performance of SMEs by combining and transferring new and existing knowledge into innovative, disruptive and competitive solutions seizing European and global business opportunities.
Market uptake and distribution of innovations[6] tackling the specific challenges in a sustainable way.
Increase of private investment in innovation, notably leverage of private co-investor and/or follow-up investments.
The expected impacts should be clearly described in qualitative and quantitative terms (e.g. on turnover, employment, market seize, IP management, sales, return on investment and profit).

The potential of Europe’s Oceans, seas and coasts is significant for job and growth creation if the appropriate investments in research and innovation are made. SMEs contribution to the development of the 'Blue Growth Strategy' (COM (2012) 494) can be significant in particular in the fields of marine biotechnology, fisheries, marine and fresh water aquaculture (including production and processing of feed and food), marine litter prevention. However, one of the most important barriers for the development of innovative maritime economic activities is the lack of access to finance for SMEs to develop high-potential, but high-risk innovative ideas and to bring them close to market. The SME instrument offers financial support to SMEs with an EU dimension to put forward their most innovative ideas in the previously mentioned maritime and aquaculture/fisheries sectors with a particular focus on close-to-market solutions and potential for high growth and internationalisation.

","SME instrument phase 1
","26 November 2015
","09 November 2017","Specific Challenge:
The potential of Europe’s Oceans, seas and coasts is significant for job and growth creation if the appropriate investments in research and innovation are made. SMEs contribution to the development of the 'Blue Growth Strategy' (COM (2012) 494) can be significant in particular in the fields of marine biotechnology, fisheries, marine and fresh water aquaculture (including production and processing of feed and food), marine litter prevention. However, one of the most important barriers for the development of innovative maritime economic activities is the lack of access to finance for SMEs to develop high-potential, but high-risk innovative ideas and to bring them close to market. The SME instrument offers financial support to SMEs with an EU dimension to put forward their most innovative ideas in the previously mentioned maritime and aquaculture/fisheries sectors with a particular focus on close-to-market solutions and potential for high growth and internationalisation.
Scope:
The SME instrument consists of three phases, including a coaching and mentoring service for beneficiaries. Participants can apply to phase 1 or directly to phase 2.
In phase 1, a feasibility study shall be developed in order to verify the technological/practical as well as economic viability of an innovation idea/concept with considerable novelty to the industry sector in which it is presented (new products, processes, design, services and technologies or new market applications of existing technologies). The activities could, for example, comprise risk assessment, market study, user involvement, Intellectual Property (IP) management[1],
innovation strategy development, partner search, feasibility of concept and the like to establish a solid high-potential innovation project aligned to the enterprise strategy and with a European dimension. Bottlenecks in the ability to increase profitability of the enterprise through innovation shall be detected and analysed during phase 1 and addressed during phase 2 to increase the return in investment in innovation activities. The proposal should contain an initial business plan based on the proposed idea/concept. It should outline the specifications of a more elaborate business plan, which is to be the outcome of the project, and the criteria for success.
Funding will be provided in the form of a lump sum of EUR 50.000. Projects should last around 6 months.
In phase 2, innovation projects[2]
will be supported that address the specific challenges identified and that demonstrate high potential in terms of company competitiveness and growth underpinned by a strategic business plan. Activities should focus on innovation activities such as demonstration, testing, prototyping, piloting, scaling-up, miniaturisation, design, market replication and the like aiming to bring an innovation idea (product, process, service etc.) to industrial readiness and maturity for market introduction, but may also include some research. For technological innovation, Technology Readiness Levels of 6 or above (or similar for non-technological innovations) are envisaged; please see part G of the General Annexes.
Proposals shall be based on an elaborate business plan. Particular attention must be paid to IP protection and ownership; applicants will have to present convincing measures to ensure the possibility of commercial exploitation ('freedom to operate').
Proposals shall contain a specification for the outcome of the project and criteria for success. They will include an explanation of how the results of the supported project are to be commercialised and of what kind of impact on the company is expected.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 0.5 and 2.5 million[3]
would allow phase 2 to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts (higher or lower). Projects should last between 12 and 24 months. [4]
Phase 3 of the SME Instrument aims to increase the economic impact of the funding provided by the SME Instrument phase 1&2 grants and by the business coaching. Phase 3 is not subsequent to phase 1 and/or 2, but provides specific support to SME instrument beneficiaries during and after phase 1 or 2.
All support under phase 3 of the SME instrument will be accessible through a single, dedicated entry point, which will serve as an information portal and a networking space.
This platform will offer access to two main strands of services:
Access to markets
Access to finance
In addition, phase 3 will create opportunities for partnering, networking and training, which are set out in the Dedicated Support Actions at the end of this call.
SME Instrument beneficiaries are also offered dedicated business innovation coaching and mentoring support. This service is facilitated by the Enterprise Europe Network and delivered by a dedicated coach through consultation and signposting to the beneficiaries. The coaches are recruited from a central database managed by the Commission and have all fulfilled stringent criteria with regards to business experience and competencies.
Throughout the three phases of the instrument, the Network will complement the coaching support by providing access to its innovation and internationalisation service offering. This could include, for example, depending on the need of the SME, support in identifying growth potential, developing a growth plan and maximising it through internationalisation; strengthening the leadership and management skills of individuals in the senior management team and developing in-house coaching capacity; developing a marketing strategy or raising external finance.
Expected Impact:
Enhancing profitability and growth performance of SMEs by combining and transferring new and existing knowledge into innovative, disruptive and competitive solutions seizing European and global business opportunities.
Market uptake and distribution of innovations[5] tackling the specific challenges in a sustainable way.
Increase of private investment in innovation, notably leverage of private co-investor and/or follow-up investments.

Innovative SMEs have been recognised as being able to become the engine of the green economy and to facilitate the transition to a resource efficient, climate-smart circular economy. They can play an important role in helping the EU to exit from the economic crises and in job creation. The potential of commercialising innovative solutions from SMEs is however hindered by several barriers including the absence of the proof of concept, the difficulty to access risk finance, the lack of prototyping, insufficient scale-up studies, etc. Growth therefore needs to be stimulated by increasing the levels of innovation in SMEs, covering their different innovation needs over the whole innovation cycle.
Innovative SMEs should be supported and guided to reach and accelerate their full green growth potential. This topic is targeted at all types of eco-innovative[1] SMEs in all areas addressing the climate action, environment, resource efficiency and raw materials challenge – including but not restricted to the 2016-2017 strategic priorities of systemic eco-innovation and circular economy, nature-based solutions, climate services, sustainable supply of raw materials, harnessing GEOSS Earth observation data, cultural heritage for sustainable growth, and water – focusing on SMEs showing a strong ambition to develop, grow and internationalise.

","SME instrument phase 1
","26 November 2015
","09 November 2017","Specific Challenge:
The healthcare biotechnology sector offers huge business and commercial opportunities; however it also requires heavy and risky investments which are often lacking in Europe, hampering the development of the industry.
The challenge includes either:
a) Cell technologies in medical applications (phase 1 only for 2016 deadlines and phase 2 for all deadlines in 2016 and 2017)
Cell technologies include cell manufacturing (culture, multiplication, scale-up and automation), preservation, banking and transport; identification, cell sorting and delivery, imaging, tracking, process and quality control; genetic engineering and gene editing; production of therapeutic biomolecules. The medical applications of cell technologies include diagnostics and biosensors; cell and gene therapy, tissue engineering, bio-artificial organs, haematology, immunotherapy, and vaccine and antibody production; predictive toxicology, synthetic biology, and modelling development and disease processes.
However, the diversity, complexity and variability of living cells pose challenges for bringing safe, reliable, regulatory-compliant and cost-effective products to the market and to the patient. SMEs developing cell-based products and processes have limited financial resources to take the critical steps to move from proof of concept to practical application while at the same time addressing considerations such as scale-up/scale-out, automation, logistics, regulatory pathways and business models.
Particular attention should be given to dialogue with regulators and compliance with safety and regulatory requirements, such as those pertaining to cell procurement, GMP, ethics, clinical trials, ATMPs and medical devices.
The challenge addresses cells from any eukaryotic source though their eventual application must be to human medicine.
Or:
b) Clinical research for the validation of biomarkers and/or diagnostic medical devices (only at the first cut-off date in 2017 and for phase 2 applications - phasing out of the topic PHC-12-2014/2015 introduced in the Work Programme 2014-2015)
Biomarkers are used in clinical practice to indicate both normal and pathological conditions. They are also used for predictive or prognostic purposes. They are being used increasingly in medicine and many potential new biomarkers are proposed every year. However, only a few of these have been validated for clinical use. To achieve validation a robust analytical method is required and a link to a pertinent clinical process or endpoint needs to be demonstrated.
This validation process should provide evidence for high analytical value, appropriate sensitivity and specificity, and clinical validity. Particular attention should be given to validation of biomarkers with potential for rapid uptake into clinical practice. Both in vivo and in vitro potential biomarkers are eligible. Priority is given to the validation of disease-related biomarkers (i.e. diagnostic, susceptibility/risk, monitoring and prognostic biomarkers). Validation of the clinical performance of new diagnostic devices can also be supported, either in combination with the biomarker validation or against existing standards.
Scope:
The SME instrument consists of three phases, including a coaching and mentoring service for beneficiaries. Participants can apply to phase 1 or directly to phase 2.
In phase 1, a feasibility study shall be developed in order to verify the technological/practical as well as economic viability of an innovation idea/concept with considerable novelty to the industry sector in which it is presented (new products, processes, design, services and technologies or new market applications of existing technologies).

Proposals shall contain a specification for the outcome of the project and criteria for success. They will include an explanation of how the results of the supported project are to be commercialised and of what kind of impact on the company is expected.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 0.5 and 2.5 million[3]

The appropriations of this Call for Proposals finance measures enabling the social partners and the social actors at company level to familiarize themselves with EU law and policies in the area of employee involvement, to exercise their rights and their duties to this regard and to work together towards the definition and implementation of concrete responses to the challenges posed to workers’ involvement. They cover in particular funding of measures aimed at strengthening transnational co-operation between workers' and employers' representatives in respect of employee involvement. These appropriations may also be used to fund short training actions as well as actions involving representatives of social partners in the candidate countries in the field of employee involvement.Measures and actions should be inclusive for vulnerable employees. In order to achieve inclusion of persons with disabilities accessibility must be ensured, for example of information, meetings, consultations, etc.
The expected results of this call for proposals are improved possibilities for the social partners to exercise their rights and duties as regards employee involvement; strengthened cooperation among social partners and other actors in respect to Union law on employee involvement; a follow up on the findings of the ""Fitness check"" on EU acts in the area of Information and Consultation of Workers, actions related to EU Directive on European Works Councils, and an increased number of social partners and other actors familiarized with transnational company agreements.
Scope:
The main purpose of this Call is to fund operations aimed at developing employee involvement in undertakings - meaning any mechanism, including information, consultation and participation, through which employees' representatives may exercise an influence on decisions to be taken within the company - in particular by raising awareness and contributing to the application of EU law and policies in this area and the take-up and development of European Works Councils.
This call also aims at supporting projects which seek to identify and address challenges in workers’ involvement resulting from changes in the world of work – e.g. restructuring, outsourcing /subcontracting, digitalisation / automation / artificial intelligence and new forms of work. Transnational actions involving representatives from several Member States as well as the joint participation of employers and workers shall be promoted"

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
The space sector is a strategic asset contributing to the independence, security and prosperity of Europe and its role in the world. Europe needs non-dependent access to critical space technologies, which is a sine qua non condition for achieving Europe’s strategic objectives. ""Non-dependence"" refers to the possibility for Europe to have free, unrestricted access to any required space technology. Reaching non-dependence in certain technologies will open new markets to our industries and will increase the overall competitiveness of the European Space sector.
Research in technologies for European non-dependence and competitiveness has been undertaken within the frame of the Commission-ESA-EDA Joint Task Force (JTF) on Critical Technologies for European non-Dependence, launched in 2008.
In 2016, the JTF established the List of Actions for 2018-2020 (hereinafter JTF List of Actions 2018-2020), aiming at enhancing the TRL of the technologies identified in the list.
Scope:
Actions from the JTF List of Actions 2018-2020 shall be implemented sequentially in 2018 and in 2019 as the following subtopics.

Context information and high-level requirements, including description of scope, initial and target TRLs, and, where applicable, references and information of related activities, are provided in the JTF List of Actions 2018-2020. Accordingly, a technical guidance document, based on the JTF List of Actions 2018-2020, is published on the Funding & Tenders Portal outlining all relevant information to the selected actions.
Activities shall be complementary and create synergy with other European activities in the same domain either in the space or non-space fields. Technological spin in and/or bilateral collaborations should be enhanced between European non-space and space industries, including technology research institutes and academia.
To this end, proposals shall include the following tasks:
Analysis of relevant available roadmaps, including roadmaps developed in the context of actions for Key Enabling Technologies supported by the Union;
Analysis of how their selected critical space technologies can contribute to different space applications or, where applicable, to non-space sectors (such as through technology transfer or spin off);
Commercial assessment of the supply chain technology in the space or non-space domains and, if applicable, a business plan for commercialisation with a full range (preload) of recurring products
With a view to achieving the non-dependence objective, applicants must
Describe the technologies and/or technology processes to be used and show that they are free of any legal export restrictions or limitations, such as those established in the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) or equivalent instruments applicable in other jurisdictions;
Set up a suitable technology development process aiming at avoiding export restrictions of non-EU states.
The involvement of post-graduate scientists, engineers and researchers and the promotion of gender balance is encouraged, for example through professional work experience or through fellowships/scholarships as applicable.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 1 and 3 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Proposals under this topic may be subject to security scrutiny if they could potentially lead to security-sensitive results that should be classified (see guide for classification available at the Funding & Tenders Portal).
Expected Impact:
To reduce the dependence on critical technologies and capabilities from outside Europe for future space applications, as identified in the JTF List of Actions 2018-2020;
To develop or regain in the mid-term the European capacity to operate independently in space, e.g. by developing in a timely manner reliable and affordable space technologies that in some cases may already exist outside Europe or in European terrestrial applications;
To enhance the technical capabilities and overall competitiveness of European space industry vendors on the worldwide market;
To open new competition opportunities for European manufacturers by reducing dependency on export restricted technologies that are of strategic importance to future European space efforts;
To improve the overall European space technology landscape and complement and/or create synergy with activities of European and national either in the space or non-space fields."

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
The context and customer field of satellite communication services is currently undergoing changes. Broadband TV applications are decreasing in importance and the importance of internet connectivity is increasing. New EU targets have been set to achieve a connectivity of 100 Mbps for all by 2025[1], for which satellite communication solutions are important, for instance in remote and offshore areas, for backhauling, or for mobile users and under emergency situations. The demand for Very High Throughput satellite communications is increasing. The 5G concept combines various access technologies, such as cellular, wireless, satellite and wireline, for delivering reliable performance for critical communications and improve area coverage[2][3] making interconnectivity an important challenge. New markets are emerging, such as for example the connectivity needed for Internet of Things. New mission concepts are currently being established, such as mega constellations or satellite networks based on micro-mini satellites. Finally, security aspects are becoming more and more important, in particular for governmental users of satellite communications. The challenge for the EU is to prepare the ground to maintain the technological leading edge and maintain its global competitiveness in satellite communications in those rapidly changing conditions and markets (e.g. towards and beyond the 1 Tbps high throughput satellites and/or fully flexible satellites)
Scope:
Proposals shall address one of the following sub-topics:
a) Secure and robust satellite communications, such as key generation and distribution, adapting to quantum technologies, anti-jamming technologies and products, anti-spoofing techniques, advanced coding, signal modulation and cryptography, secured uncoordinated multiple access, threats simulation, secure and robust telemetry, tracking and command (spread spectrum);
b) Bandwidth efficient transmission techniques to serve multiple users with high throughput satellites, e.g. frequency reuse techniques, multiple antenna communications, beamforming, cooperative gateway diversity, user clustering and interference mitigation;
c) High speed processing and flexible and reprogrammable telecommunication payloads, able to adapt to changing service needs such as capacity flexibility and geographic redistribution of the traffic and to satellites integration in the 5G protocol and system. Simulation and end-to-end resources management shall be addressed;
d) Optical communications, including photonics, for very high throughput systems with more than 10 Gbps (e.g. hybrid RF/optical payloads use of optical up- and down links), on-board and ground aspects focusing on feeder links, system and architecture aspects encompassing technologies such as enhanced space-to-ground/RPAS; low complexity on-board processing and limited coherent processing; orbit to ground mission data download focussing on very high throughput optical feeder links (up to 1 Tbps) and very high speed rates optical ground station for feeder links (towards 1Tbps);

Access to space is an indispensable element of the entire value chain of space and has been recognised as an area of strategic importance towards the direction of Europe's non-dependence.
Access to space is a matter of security of supply, industry capability and technology readiness and a sine qua non condition of the modern space knowledge-based economies. Only a handful of space-faring countries master this capability as a result of extensive institutional funding for research and development costs and the guarantee of services exploitation. Europe has achieved its remarkable position in this field thanks to national programmes and the programmes of the European Space Agency, Access to Space being one fundamental origin of its creation in 1975.
The Space Strategy for Europe has confirmed that Europe shall maintain autonomous, reliable and cost-effective access to space. It underlined that it is crucial that Europe continues to have modern, efficient and flexible launch, production and test infrastructure facilities.
Cost reduction and improving flexibility of European launch systems are the main challenges in order to foster European industry competitiveness on the global market.
The industry 4.0 transformational wave is likely to bring opportunities for lowering the cost of space launch manufacturing/integration/testing/operations and further improving quality.
The specific challenge is to support research and innovation in technologies, in complementarity and full synergy with the on-going work undertaken by Member States and European initiatives, contributing to:
Investigate the potential Launch system reusability technologies;
Launch system advanced manufacturing and modern ground infrastructures.
Scope:
Each proposal shall address only one of the following two sub-topics:
a) Potential Launch system reusability technologies and their applicability for European needs: With an aim at further lowering cost for the next generation of European launchers and transportation systems, activities shall only address new technologies relevant to reusability, such as advanced avionics and data management (e.g. optimised return concepts including autonomous safety), advanced structural parts and materials, health monitoring systems and non-destructive control technologies, advanced propulsion systems & equipment (e.g. propellant management, disconnection systems and special ground systems). These could be used as building blocks for in-flight demonstration. The activities shall include an assessment of the cost effectiveness of the proposed new technologies expected for the exploitation phase (flight and ground operations) and an estimation of the necessary investments and time schedule needed to reach TRL 8/9.
TRL 5/6 should be sought at completion of the proposed activities in view of a possible IOD/IOV in-flight demonstration as a next step.
b) Launch system advanced manufacturing (e.g. tooling and machines) and modern infrastructures (including ground infrastructures for low cost European launch sites): Activities shall address technologies and processes applied to launch systems development, production, testing and operations (applicable to European space transportation systems including mini and micro launch systems) such as automation of activities (e.g. automated guided handling tools, automated integration, and inspection, collaborative robots, automated testing), digital technologies to the benefit of quality and costs (e.g. usage of COTS (commercial-of-the-shelf) equipment, digital assistance to operators, big data processing for continuous improvement), advanced materials with accent on low-cost manufacturing processes (e.g. 3D printing, composite, joining technology) and remote operations (e.g. remote control centre, improved safety management), ground infrastructures for European launch sites including for low cost access to space for mini, micro, nano satellites, including commercial initiatives. The proposed solutions to be considered will take into account the possible evolutions of the regulatory framework, in particular REACH, and will also take into account the environmental impacts and health risks.
For each topic, activities shall be complementary with other European activities in the same domain.
These activities shall consist of research, innovation, development and qualification work which can be readily integrated within current and planned European launch, test and production infrastructures. A preliminary implementation plan shall be included in the proposal and detailed during the action.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 2 and 3 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
Improved European competitiveness in cost-effective reusability technologies for space transportation systems complementary with other European activities in the same domain leading to launch system reusability solutions which could be demonstrated in flight within three to five years, including forecast of investment needed;
Increase compliance with the evolutions of the regulatory framework, in particular REACH;
Improved quality and safety control solutions, which are absolutely fundamental in rocketry;
Cost reduction of space transportation system manufacturing, integration, testing and operations thanks to research and innovation in advanced manufacturing and modernisation of infrastructures taking into account the evolution of the normative framework and environmental impacts. This is aimed at improving the overall competitiveness of European solutions on the worldwide market and helping create new jobs;
Integration of human factors in ground facilities, such as improved work environment for operators, efficiency, quality of operations and human safety."

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
In the mid- and long-term the competitiveness of the space sector and its ability to serve the Union's internal and external policies, including the Space Strategy for Europe and the Common Security and Defence Policy, depends on the continuous incorporation of advanced basic technologies of common interest to all applications, including cross-cutting technologies such as power management, thermal control, materials and structures.
Advancements in these technology domains are necessary to enable new spacecraft or mission concepts with higher performances, higher power demand, lower mass and cost, such as higher data throughput systems and mega-constellations. As well, they can contribute to mitigate the risks related to the European dependence in space technologies. Moreover, a number of related challenges have parallels to terrestrial challenges, for example in the fields of aeronautics, energy, environment, advanced materials and production methods. Complementarity and synergy with on-going or planned European developments both in the space and non-space sectors is a challenge to address.
Scope:
Activities shall advance, or spin-in from other fields, space technologies in the domain of power management, thermal control, materials, structures and processes. Incremental or potentially disruptive advancements can be both targeted.
Proposals based on low TRL technologies are solicited. The target is to demonstrate these up to medium TRL (4-6).
Each proposal shall address only one of the following sub-topics:
a) Innovative solutions for very high power systems, including solutions for power generation, storage, control and distribution able to support highly dissipative missions requirements. Innovation is sought in the areas of the high power electrical propulsion (> 20 kW) consistent with activities under the ""In-space electrical propulsion and station keeping"" SRC, very high throughput satellites, high power active antennas in high frequency bands, high capacity battery cells, low-cost ultra-capacitors, technologies for flexible/foldable arrays (aiming at >25 kW, addressing mechanical architecture and flexible solutions), regenerative fuels cells, low cost direct drive units, solar cells;
b) Innovative thermal control solutions for high temperature missions: high power communications, high voltage and high power systems, pose growing challenges to the thermal budget of the spacecraft or re-entry vehicle. Innovation is sought in the area of materials and thermal control solutions (e.g. heat pumps, advanced loop heat pipes, mechanical pumped loops, flexible self-regulated heaters), addressing thermal protection, thermal regulation, thermal stability, materials with variable emissivity/absorptivity; innovative thermal control surfaces, conductive/dissipative carbon fibre reinforced plastic (CFRP) panel;
c) Spacecraft bus stability and line-of-sight technologies: critical sensors and actuator solutions for high stability and line-of-sight control at spacecraft platform level, including sensors and actuators, focusing on competitiveness through efficiency and miniaturisation (and hybridisation);
d) Advanced materials, structures and production techniques (e.g. additive manufacturing): activities shall address technologies applied to space flight elements manufacturing with a focus on low-cost on-ground manufacturing processes in support to mega-constellations or on on-orbit manufacturing processes in support to space exploration;
e) Ground systems with massive processing: data processing capabilities of missions for different applications, including ground control stations for remote sensing operations; processing power and speed, post-processing, data fusion, data networks, configuration life-cycle management and operations (particularly for constellations, including mega-constellations), integration of new technologies in ground systems and data processing (big data archiving and retrieval, smart data optimisation, automated data processing, distributed data platforms, artificial intelligence, full automation), distributed data exploitation platform.
Low cost solutions based on components off the shelf (COTS) are encouraged.
Participation of industry, in particular SMEs, is encouraged too.
Activities shall be complementary and create synergy with other European activities in the same domain either in the space or non-space fields. Technological spin in and/or bilateral collaborations should be enhanced between European non-space and space industries.
To this end, proposals shall include the following tasks:

","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
The overall challenge of this strategic research cluster (SRC) is to enable major advances in space robotic technologies for future on-orbit missions (robotics and proximity rendezvous) and the exploration of the surfaces of the other bodies in our solar system.
The first activities in the SRC have addressed designing, manufacturing and testing of reliable and high performance common robotic building blocks for operation in space environments (orbital and/or planetary) which will be used for the activities subject to this call. The specific challenge is now to integrate the previously prepared common building blocks into demonstrators on ground, towards applications of space robotics in the field of orbital and planetary use. These robotics applications address not only the future needs of exploration and exploitation of space but also potential spin-off and spill-over effects to other areas of robotic activity on Earth, such as automotive, mining, construction, nuclear, or underwater.
Scope:
Each proposal shall address only one of the following sub-topics:
a) Orbital Support Services: demonstrate the techniques needed to offer a commercial service to operational satellites. This shall as minimum address robotic deployment and refuelling of satellites in orbit. By means of a general purpose robotic arm, a servicing satellite must be capable to demonstrate release, grasping, berthing and manipulation of a target satellite including services such as refuelling.
b) Robotised assembly of large modular orbital structures: integrate a robot system and a set of functional modules that can assemble a large structure (such as a large reflector) otherwise not feasible with a single launch.
c) Robotised reconfiguration of satellites: develop a satellite-mounted robot system and its related implements that can modify the functionality of a satellite by adding/replacing modules available on-board or provided by another servicing satellite.
d) Autonomous decision making: integrate a rover system with long traverse capabilities (kilometres a day) managing independently the decisions required to reduce risks and seize opportunities. Such a rover system will be required to travel independently from a starting point (e.g. a lander) towards an end point (say a cache of sample), perform independent opportunistic science on the way and return to the lander with the acquired soil sample.
e) Exploring robot-robot interaction. Proposals could address one of the following two scenarios. Advanced mobility: a suite of robots endowed with diverse mobility that can cooperate autonomously in the exploration of very hard-to-reach planetary areas. This team of robots will be entrusted to undertake multiple descents and ascents into a crater/gully performing coordinated mapping and science. Robotised construction: a team of specialised robots with multiple robotic arms and end-effectors that, through a minimum of drilling, excavating and manipulating, can cooperatively put together a future planetary base/ISRU [1] plant.
Proposals shall build on the results of the five projects of the 2016 call developing common building blocks of the Robotics SRC and shall therefore describe how this is done. A guidance document is published together with this work programme[2].
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 3 and 4 million for sub-topics a) to c) and EUR 2 and 3 million for sub-topics d) to e) would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
Space robotics technologies developed under this topic are expected to increase the performance of space missions in a cost effective manner. Synergies with terrestrial robotics would increase the sustainability of the European space sector at large.
Additionally, for the orbital track (sub-topics a, b and c):
Enable multiple business cases not possible with current monolithic satellite systems
Foster rapid development and production on demand to reduce cost and time
Setting technology standards for commercialisation of space (interfaces, building blocks etc.)
Additionally, for the planetary track (sub-topics d and e):
Improve yield of planetary missions by providing 10x more science
Allow estimation of feasibility of planetary exploitation activities
Spin-out of space robotics technologies, e.g. autonomy, to terrestrial activities such as agriculture and mining.
Spin-in of terrestrial activities (e.g. automated waste handling) to the space robotics sector.

The challenge of this strategic research cluster (SRC) is to enable major advances in Electric Propulsion (EP) for in-space operations and transportation, in order to contribute to guarantee the leadership through competitiveness and non-dependence of European capabilities in electric propulsion at world level within the 2020-2030 timeframe, always in coherence with the existing and planned developments at national, commercial and ESA level. The specific challenge of this action is to enable faster maturation of promising disruptive thruster concepts and technologies, as a necessary step towards demonstration actions. The detailed challenges are elaborated in the guidelines document 'EPIC Roadmap'[1]
Scope:
A disruptive electric propulsion technology is a technology that disrupts a status quo in the space sector. It could replace the dominant technology by providing radical improvements in performance or costs which are perceived as valuable by a customer or part of the market, or it opens up new opportunities not possible with the incumbent technology. Emerging technologies that are potentially ‘disruptive’ often underperform compared to the dominant technology in early development phases – the underlying physics may not be fully understood for example and more R&D is required to properly ascertain performance attributes. Examples can be: disruptive improvement of performances, enabling of new operational scenarios, reducing costs of the full system etc.
Proposals shall cover one of the following two subtopics:
Thruster concepts or technologies for disruptive electric propulsion systems such as Helicon Plasma Thrusters (HPT), Electron Cyclotron Resonance plasma thrusters (ECR), Magneto Plasma Dynamic thrusters (MPD), Pulsed Plasma Thrusters (PPT), micro-propulsion electric thrusters, or any other innovative electric thruster concepts and relevant technologies for disruptive electric propulsion systems.
Transversal concepts and technologies for disruptive electric propulsion systems, such as power condition electronics, direct drive, magnetic nozzles, alternative propellants, testing techniques, materials.
Proposals may target any part of the technology readiness levels (TRL) scale, in particular:
Breakthrough technologies starting at low or very low TRL (<4), aiming to promote promising and potentially disruptive thrusters concepts in the field of Electric Propulsion. This should allow increasing of the current TRL, which in the long term could change the Electric Propulsion landscape.
Promising technologies starting at higher TRL (≥4) in the field of Electric Propulsion, enabling significant improvements of Electric Propulsion system performances, cost and fit to the market. The objective here is to allow to efficiently and effectively increase the TRL. Proposal for higher TRL should include the best possible combination of a market analysis and an application impact analysis.
Proposals shall include a market analysis detailing the targeted applications and the specific key advantages of the proposed technology. Every disruptive effect shall be specifically correlated with its final application
Proposals shall not be based on technology lines mentioned in the call topic COMPET-3-2016-a for incremental EP technologies[2].
The involvement of post-graduate scientists, engineers and researchers is encouraged, for example through professional work experience or through fellowships/scholarships as applicable.
The Commission considers that proposals for the disruptive technologies requesting a contribution from the EU of EUR 1 million for activities starting from TRL < 4 and of EUR 1 to 2 million for activities starting from TRL ≥ 4 would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
To promote and accelerate the development of potentially breakthrough EP or EP-related concepts and technologies in order to be able to provoke a disruption in the propulsion landscape in the medium to long-term.
To foster the necessary long term evolutions needed to provide Europe with competitive and innovative electric propulsion products in order to maintain the European capacity to compete in the worldwide arena of electric propulsion satellites.
To enable the identification and targeting of future markets and applications which are not yet addressed by the current well-established products or their expected improvements.

Great advances in the knowledge of the Universe and the Solar system have been enabled by the data delivered by space science as well as human and robotic exploration missions and ground-based space observatories. Europe contributed to these endeavours by developing and implementing world-class space missions and ground-based infrastructure, in the context of national, ESA and ESO scientific programmes, and often in partnership with major international players.
Continued collaborative efforts are needed to prepare the scientific instruments and technologies that will enable future space science and exploration missions.
The challenge is to foster cooperation between scientific, engineering and industrial teams, within and outside Europe, to develop instrumentation and technologies enabling space science and exploration, including planetary exploration, missions, stimulating synergies between space and ground-based observations combining and reusing different technologies, techniques and methodologies.
Scope:
The development of instrumentation and technologies enabling space science and exploration missions may address early scientific instrumentation and technology development associated to future space science and exploration, including planetary exploration missions. The development of new and innovative approaches, such as the use of Cubesats and other small space platforms, including planetary entry probe, or the use of Commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) components is encouraged as long as it leads or contributes to the implementation of space science and exploration with significant scientific outputs.
Advances are expected in support to on-site activities such as landing, planetary navigation, sample collection and processing or in-situ analysis.

","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
The overall challenge of this Strategic Research Cluster (SRC) is to enable major advances in space robotic technologies for future on-orbit missions requiring robotic activity and proximity rendezvous, and the exploration of the surfaces of the other bodies in our solar system.
The first activities in the SRC have addressed designing, manufacturing and testing of reliable and high performance robotic Common Building Blocks for operation in space environments (orbital and/or planetary). The specific challenge of the second call was to integrate the previously prepared Common Building Blocks into demonstrators on ground, towards applications of space robotics in the field of orbital and planetary use. These robotics applications address the future needs of exploration (advanced autonomy and robot cooperation relying on AI and other techniques) and commercial exploitation of space (on-orbit servicing, in-orbit assembly and reconfigurable satellites).
The objective of this third call is to prepare the technologies for demonstrators planned to be implemented in the 2023-2027 timeframe. The successful proposals shall validate relevant applications for both orbital and planetary scenarios relying on technologies derived from previous SRC activities.
Scope:
Each proposal shall address only one of the following sub-topics:
a) In-orbit Demonstrator Mission Study: a study (up to and including Phase B1) of an In-Orbit Demonstrator (IOD) that will validate previous developments of the SRC for the purpose of simultaneously satisfying short-term (ie on-orbit inspection, life extension, de-orbiting) and mid-to-long-term (ie APM exchange, reconfiguration, on-orbit assembly/manufacturing) horizons. The successful proposals should articulate the means to connect these two different business cases in a single demonstrator. The proposed demonstrator should represent a risk-taking, disruptive approach to enable new commercial opportunities in space.
The Orbital Mission Study should provide a feasibility study relating to the demonstrator mission (Phase A) and a preliminary design of this mission (Phase B1) outlining system and technology requirements.
In parallel to this, the proposal should outline which hardware and software technologies, as defined in the Mission Study, will be developed by the consortium in order to achieve this level of technology maturation.
As such, each proposal should cover the following areas:
Global market & trend analysis: The proposal shall detail the business cases that will be enabled by the demonstrator and the new market opportunities that will be generated in the space sector in Europe.
Transition into the new paradigm: The Proposal shall explain how the demonstrator will facilitate the smooth transition between the short-term market need and future commercial possibilities through the generation of new modular and reconfigurable, intelligent satellites. Furthermore, the proposed mission and system design shall allow the integration of other functional building blocks into the system at later phases (for example, Phases C and D) of the project. This shall demonstrate increased flexibility before launch compared to conventional systems.
TRL increase of critical systems: The proposal shall not only cover the phase A and B1 studies of the mission, but also identify and undertake the critical hardware developments and technology maturation needed to ensure the viability of the demonstrator in the next phases.
b) Advanced Robotics Planetary Exploration: the next step in exploration will target areas of planets that are hard to reach, such as gullies, cliffs, craters and lava tubes. This requires improved capability in the rover’s understanding of its environment (not simply 2D with obstacles, but fully 3D), and capabilities in motion planning and execution which have not previously been demonstrated. This sub-topic aims to integrate the state-of-the-art technology (artificial intelligence, sensing and modelling complex environments, diverse means of locomotion, and cooperative planning and decision making) needed for this application.
The successful proposal should aim to overcome these current constraints by identifying the gaps in technology and knowledge and providing innovative solutions.
In detail, the successful proposal should address the following aspects:
Demonstrator: the design and implementation of an exploration demonstrator to simulate hazardous and/or difficult extra-terrestrial terrain and test the technologies required to plan, navigate, traverse and investigate them.
Technology development: Identification and development/maturation of the critical software and/or hardware technologies needed to enable the exploration of previously inaccessible areas on planetary surfaces. The spin-in of technologies from terrestrial sectors shall be investigated for this purpose.
Case Study exploring terrestrial exploitation: provision a full case study demonstrating how the submitted technology can be exploited on Earth to solve problems in terrestrial sectors and scenarios.
Re-use and improvement of the technologies and products of the previous SRC Calls: inclusion of a dedicated section explaining how to implement and develop the results of the previous SRC Calls, both in terms of building blocks and of system design.
The results of the successful project, coupled with the results of the previous SRC calls, will be crucial in paving the way for future European activities in planetary exploration.
At least two proposals will be selected for subtopic a) and at least of one proposal for subtopic b).
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of around 3 million EUR would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
A guidance document will be made available on the Funding & Tenders Portal.
Grants awarded under this topic will be complementary to each other and complementary to grants awarded under other previous SRC topics COMPET-4-2014, COMPET-4-2016 and SPACE-12-TEC-2018. In order to ensure a smooth and successful implementation of this Strategic Research Cluster, the beneficiaries of complementary grants (""complementary beneficiaries"") shall join the already established ""collaboration agreement"". The respective options of Article 2, Article 31.6 and Article 41.4 2 of the Model Grant Agreement will be applied.
Proposals under this topic may be subject to security scrutiny if they could potentially lead to security-sensitive results that should be classified (see guide for classification available at the Funding & Tenders Portal).
Expected Impact:
Space robotics technologies developed under these sub-topics are expected to increase the performance of space missions in a cost-effective manner and enable new business cases considering New Space approaches.
Additionally, for the sub-topic a) the results are expected to:
Propose multiple new business cases and enable new market opportunities reflected by the paradigm shift from mission-specific solutions to modular, intelligent, flexible spacecraft;
Increase the viability of the demonstrator(s) through the necessary hardware developments;
Provide a qualitative and quantitative evaluation of the economical, technical, scientific and performance-related impact and benefits of standardized technologies, in order to tangibly contribute towards emerging regulations governing the commercial use of such technologies in space.
Additionally, for sub-topic b) the results are expected to:
Improve the scientific yield of planetary missions by increasing accessibility;
Lead to mission studies for challenging, next-generation planetary exploration;
Lead to tangible exploitation of planetary exploration technologies in terrestrial applications and vice versa."

","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
The challenge of this strategic research cluster (SRC) is to enable major advances in Electric Propulsion (EP) for in-space operations and transportation, in order to contribute to the European leadership through competitiveness and non-dependence in electric propulsion at world level within the 2020-2030 timeframe, always in coherence and non- duplication with the existing and planned developments at national, commercial, EU and ESA level.
Scope:
Incremental Technologies are those currently considered mature enough to allow incremental steps enabling new capabilities required by a number of applications.
Proposals should, therefore, enable incremental advances in the already mature technologies for Electric Propulsion Systems[1] based on:
1. Hall Effect Thrusters (HET)
2. Gridded Ion Engines (GIE)
3. High Efficiency Multistage Plasma Thrusters (HEMPT).
The advantage of having several mature technologies in the portfolio is a particular strength of the European EP scene. The three Incremental Technologies have individual strengths and weaknesses, which make them more competitive for certain applications and less competitive for others.
The EPIC roadmap developed by the EPIC PSA addresses all three technologies in the Incremental Technology line. The COMPET-3-2016-a Call allowed the three Electric Propulsion Systems based on these technologies, to be developed to higher TRL levels on a first stage (2016-2020), while complying with certain requirements and TRL objectives to address the needs of a number of applications.
Regarding new markets and applications, as constellations in the Low power range, and dual mode features for Electric Orbit Raising (EOR) and Station Keeping (SK) in the Medium power range, it is not possible to tell at the time being, which Incremental Technology would be the best suited for the market at the end of the SRC (2023/2024).This approach guarantees a high flexibility to react to possible changes of the satellite market needs and unforeseen developments of the launcher market, giving to the European stakeholders a strategic and flexible position, clearly demanded by Satellite Operators and Large System Integrators.
Proposals shall address further development of the most promising Incremental Technologies which have a TRL not lower than the expected target from the COMPET-3-2016-a Call, up to design, industrialisation and qualification level of the overall Electric Propulsion System, in order to guarantee the current leadership through competitiveness of European electric propulsion.
Actions should focus on design, industrialisation and qualification to allow flight readiness of the overall Electric Propulsion System in the required SRC timeframe, by means of an advanced Engineering Model (EM) built on the results obtained from the bread board model developed in the COMPET-3-2016-a Call, to be followed by a Qualification Model (QM). Proposals should seek to cover incremental developments up to the specified TRL level.
Proposals should enable incremental advances on the already mature technologies for Electric Propulsion Systems, with the focus on product development for the most promising applications and future expected markets in line with the market studies: Telecom applications, Constellation, Navigation, LEO applications, Exploration and Space transportation.
The retained application domains are identified for the call into 3 power range classes: Low power (i.e. for constellations and LEO applications) from 200 W to 700 W; Medium power dual mode i.e. for Telecom and Navigation applications > 3.0 kW for SK and > 5.0 kW for EOR, and High power (i.e. for Exploration and Space transportation) > 20.0 kW.
Proposals should provide for each product the attainable objectives at the end of the phase 2 in terms of performance (thrust, specific impulse (ISP), power), of costs (recurring costs) and achieved TRL. A detailed description of the above Incremental Technologies and the most promising applications is included in the corresponding guidelines available on the Funding & Tenders Portal.
Proposals on Incremental Technologies should demonstrate the readiness and interest to carry the developments further on for a possible future in-orbit demonstration (IOD) and a business plan on how to access the current or future expected markets.
The Commission considers that proposals for the Incremental Technologies requesting contributions in the following amounts would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately.
Proposals are invited for the following three sub-topics:
a) Low power electric propulsion
A total of EUR 12 million will be granted to Low power Electric Propulsion Systems (i.e. for Constellations and LEO applications) from 200 W to 700 W. The maximum requested EU funding per proposal is EUR 4 million. The target TRL at the end of the project should be at least [6/7].
At least one proposal will be selected for line 1/HET.
At least one proposal will be selected for line 2/GIE.
At least one proposal will be selected for line 3/HEMPT.
b) Medium power electric propulsion
A total of EUR 9 million will be granted to Medium power dual mode (i.e. for Telecom and Navigation applications) > 3.0 kW for SK and > 5.0 kW for EOR. The maximum requested EU funding per proposal is EUR 4.5 million. The target TRL at the end of the project should be at least [6/7].
At least two proposals will be selected, each one of a different technology from the three Incremental Technologies (HET, GIE, HEMPT).
c) High power electric propulsion
A total of EUR 3 million will be granted to a High power (i.e. for Exploration and Space transportation) > 20.0 kW. The maximum requested EU funding per proposal is EUR 3 million. The target TRL at the end of the project is [5/6].
At least one proposal will be selected from the three Incremental Technologies (HET, GIE, HEMPT).
Grants awarded under this topic will be complementary to each other and complementary to grants awarded under other previous SRC Calls topics: COMPET-3-2016-a, COMPET-3-2016-b, SPACE-13-TEC-2019 (""complementary grants""). In order to ensure a smooth and successful implementation of this Strategic Research Cluster (SRC), the beneficiaries of complementary grants (""complementary beneficiaries"") shall conclude a written ""collaboration agreement"".
Proposals under this topic may be subject to security scrutiny if they could potentially lead to security-sensitive results that should be classified (see guide for classification available at the Funding & Tenders Portal).
Expected Impact:
To develop, in the mid-term, the European capacity to compete in the worldwide arena of electric propulsion satellites and missions and be in time to market.
To substantially increase medium and long term competitiveness of existing Electric Propulsion System technologies with a technology and application-driven approach.
To pursue developments which shall be mainly market-oriented, beneficial at system level and with a strategic view to long term needs.
To enable medium and longer term applications: Telecom, Space Transportation, LEO, MEO, Exploration or Science.
To anticipate ambitious long-term market evolution and strategic opportunities, so that the developed Electric Propulsion Systems could create new markets and shape existing ones.
To develop the Incremental Technology Electric Propulsion System up to system demonstration in a space environment and ready for its qualification.
[1]Electric Propulsion System components are: thruster, fluid management system and the power components only. The mechanisms, deployment and tanks are excluded, as indicated in the EPIC Roadmap and guidelines (available on the Funding & Tenders Portal)."

Deadline date","Scope:
Specific challenge:Use of biomass, residues and waste gases as feedstock/raw materials in industry to produce green chemical building blocks and energy is expected to increase significantly in the coming years. This will play a vital role in the establishment of a more sustainable and low carbon industry. However, the increased use of biomass, residues and waste gases as feedstock/raw materials in industry poses a number of challenges that need to be addressed, such as seasonal and fragmented availability, short harvesting windows, environmental challenges, variable availability and/or quality of supply, and presumed competition with animal or human food supply. In addition, it is important to develop highly efficient equipment using novel techniques and evaluate the use of biomass and residues as feedstock for co-firing in industrial processes to detect potential operational problems. Changing markets and making new links in the value chains will be an added challenge in the future production systems based on cross sectorial integration. These challenges have to be overcome in order to allow increased utilisation of biomass residues and waste gases in the industry.
New approaches have demonstrated that small mobile and flexible units with chemical processing and process intensification capabilities could provide several advantages in comparison to fixed facilities, such as operation in a distributed manner and mobility to different locations providing higher flexibility. This could provide convenient business opportunities especially for processes presenting a variable feed supply, fragmented feedstock availability and/or need for mobility to different locations to maximise usage time.
Scope:Projects should develop new processes or improved valorisation approaches that would provide efficient biomass, residue and waste gas conversion (or biomass pre-treatment for further refining) while developing a fully integrated system and the associated equipment for downstream use. These processes should allow an increased utilisation of renewables (where economically and technically favourable relative to other potential applications) as feedstock for the production of chemicals (including intermediates) and/or fuels as part of an integrated approach to optimise resource and energy efficiency. Such processes should be presented with a containerised, flexible and scalable approach allowing for (pre-) processing of biomass, residues and waste gases at locations closer to the supply. The proposed solutions should be able to cope with the seasonal or even daily fluctuations of the renewable source to be used. In this respect the unit should also be able to process feedstock from different sources in order to guarantee the level of supply.
The proposed solutions should provide economically viable alternatives to current practice in biomass processing and demonstrate business feasibility. Moreover, new innovative technologies and approaches are expected to substitute the current fossil fuels by renewables as feedstock. LCA and LCC analysis for the proposed processes is needed in order to prove the sustainability of the solutions. It is desirable to develop and demonstrate a multi-sectorial and replicable methodology for increasing the renewable resources integration in industrial processing. It is expected that high amounts of biomass, residues and waste gases will be further used in energy intensive industries, enhancing the efficiency in the use of these resources. Substantial demonstration activities in conjunction with the development of solution-adapted equipment are expected.
For this topic, proposals should include an outline of the initial exploitation and business plans, which will be developed further in the proposed project.
Wherever possible, proposers could actively seek synergies, including possibilities for funding, with relevant national / regional research and innovation programmes and/or cumulative funding with European Structural and Investment Funds in connection with smart specialisation strategies. For this purpose the tools provided by the Smart Specialization Platform, Eye@RIS3 may be useful[1]. The initial exploitation and business plans will address such synergies and/or additional funding. Exploitation plans, outline financial arrangements and any follow-up will be developed further during the project. The results of these activities as well as the envisaged further activities in this respect should be described in the final report of the project.
 Activities expected to focus on Technology Readiness Level 5-7. A significant participation of SMEs with R&D capacities is encouraged.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU between EUR 6 and 10 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected impact:
                Economically viable solutions and technologies allowing a reduction in fossil resources intensity of at least 30%, compared to current practices (for already optimal processes the savings could also come from reduction in fossil energy for feedstock transportation). It should lead to increased utilisation of renewables in the industry as feedstock for the production of chemicals (and/or intermediates) and/or fuels as part of an integrated approach to optimise energy efficiency with a proven sustainability, taking into account environmental issues and competition with food. In addition, the solutions are expected to contribute to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions.
                The technologies developed should integrate well in the current industrial landscape providing finished products and/or intermediate and building blocks that could be processed in already existing industries. 
                They could also show a direct or indirect impact on rural areas, arising from the increased use of biomass and residues production locally.

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
All current plants in process industries have control systems managing their production processes. Distributed Control Systems (DCS) and Programmable Logic Controls (PLC) are present all across production sites with continuous semi-continuous or batch processes. However, there is still a lack of integration of local control systems dedicated to unit processes into an overarching real-time optimisation and scheduling system controlling and monitoring the operations of the whole plant. This plant or even site-wide integration is especially challenging for production processes where monitoring involves the collection and evaluation of large amounts of data.
Future plant monitoring and control systems will have to integrate lower scale model based control frameworks into plant scale scheduling, or even geographic and logistic optimisation tools. The generalisation of model based predictive control techniques to plant-wide and possibly site-wide monitoring and control should be developed using overall plant models, and optimised solutions should be demonstrated.
Scope:
Research activities should address all of the following areas:
Extension of the model based control techniques to the level of plant or site-wide control and scheduling by the use of dynamic overall plant models, ensuring a robust real-time optimisation of the plant's operations.
Integration of local control systems into an overarching real-time plant and/or site optimisation and scheduling system, taking into account geographic and logistic constraints, potential malfunctions and providing the necessary interfaces for real-time communication between systems.
Cross-sectorial transfer of the technologies developed.
Model Based Predictive Control frameworks taking into account the Operators Training Systems in their design.
Plant level LC management tools (integrated or possibly as a plug-in to the control system) and robustness of the real-time optimisation tools.
Solutions should consider the “data-intensive” nature of the process chains (data reliability, handling of huge amounts of data in real-time, extraction of decisions from large data-sets. Proof of concept in terms of at least one demonstrator should be delivered before the end of the project, excluding commercially usable prototypes, but convincingly demonstrating scalability towards industrial needs and making a clear case for the safety of the worker under all circumstances.
The project can make use of pre-existing commercially available plant optimisation and scheduling solutions, making all the required adaptations. In order to ensure the impact of the project, standardisation is to be addressed.
Activities are expected to focus on Technology Readiness Levels 4 to 6.
This topic is particularly suitable for SMEs.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU between EUR 4 and 6 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
Compared to the current practice in the sector:
Decrease of on-site material handling time by 10%
Decrease of resource consumption by 10%
Decrease the global use of energy on-site by 10%.
Decrease of the Green House Gases emissions by 10%.
Strengthen the global position of European process industry through the adoption of the new technologies related to plant-wide and/or, if possible, site-wide process control.

Deadline date","Scope:
Specific challenge:Current operations for the separation and fractionation of solid, gas and liquid mixtures represent on average 20-70% of the total capital and operating costs for most of the current plants in the process industry. These operations are also very energy-consuming, as they account for up to 45% of all the process energy used, for example, by the chemical and raw materials refining industries. Major improvements of these processes leading to more efficient and cost effective solutions are paramount in achieving a more sustainable European industry.
In this respect, hybrid technologies combining different techniques, such as distillation, membrane permeation, adsorption, extraction, etc. have already been applied successfully to a number of industrial processes. They can provide a cost effective solution to achieve major improvements in separation and fractionation operations, leading to waste reduction, lowering greenhouse gas emissions, and improved energy efficiency.
To realise the full potential of these technologies, further investigation and a deeper understanding are required of hybrid separation techniques (e.g. distillation, extraction, drying, crystallisation and reactive separation), in particular leading to a better understanding of how the different components interact with each other. This may also facilitate the transition from batch to continuous processes in the next generation of plants, increasing yield, purity and quality of products while improving productivity.
To enable the deployment of innovative highly-efficient separation and fractionation technologies in industry, the development of new approaches for the design and scale up of the overall production processes might also be required. If possible, these innovative approaches should regard the primary process and the downstream separation as one single, integrated process.
The aim is to provide innovative solutions for downstream processing, advance in the integration of different separation techniques into complex hybrid units and provide tools for the design of such units.
Scope:The proposals should provide a proof of economic and industrial feasibility for the new technologies. The proposed solutions should also have potential for integration in the current industrial scenario, and should be suitable for different sectors in the process industry. Important aspects that should be taken into considerations are:
-                      Compatibility with continuous processes and support for the transition from batch processes to more efficient and reliable continuous operations (where relevant).
-                      Reduction of production costs and time to market by providing tools for process and separation unit design and optimisation.
-                      Significant improvements in energy and resource efficiency.
-                      Significant reduction in greenhouse gas emissions.
-                      Improvement in safety of the work environment.
Projects are expected to carry out demonstration activities in industrial environments aimed at proving the industrial relevance and feasibility of the proposed technologies, clearly showing the potential integration into current plants.

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Bio-based resources constitute a valuable source of sustainable raw materials for Europe, but currently they are not utilised in an optimal way. For example, residues from agriculture and forestry (e.g. lignocellulose), as well as waste streams from aquaculture, farms, and food and feed industry (including skins, feathers, fats, shells, by-products from slaughter-houses and fish mills, etc.) and biodegradable industrial waste are often not fully exploited. Considering that such bio-resources contain valuable substances for the production of high added value chemicals and bio-materials (e.g. sugars, fatty acids, amino acids, alcohols, resins, fibres, aromatic substances, proteins), which could provide sustainable alternatives to analogues currently manufactured from fossil feedstock, their efficient utilisation is needed in order to support the establishment of a more sustainable and efficient industry in Europe. Furthermore, these bio-based streams could provide access to new building blocks and products with added functionalities, which are currently not commercially available, thus opening new market opportunities for industry.
For a wider utilisation of such bio-resources, the development of technologies for the efficient processing, isolation, fractionation and purification of these waste and side streams, will be essential to efficiently recover valuable bio-components, while maintaining key chemical functionalities present in bio-based molecules. The industrial deployment of such technologies will allow improving the competitiveness of the European chemical and process industry and will ensure a better utilisation of available European bio-resources. These technologies will also support a decrease in waste generation and contribute to making Europe self-sufficient in terms of raw materials, leading to increased long term sustainability for the European process industry.

Proposals should address the efficient utilisation of biomass waste streams of organic nature from industrial processes (e.g. food and feed industry, aquaculture)and/or side streams from harvesting activities (e.g. agricultural and forestry harvesting residues) ensuring non-competition with higher value chains (e.g. food production). The proposals should aim to provide novel concepts to fully valorise these bio-resources, providing high added-value products, chemical building blocks and bio-based streams (bio-chemicals, monomers, fibres, polymers, proteins etc.) for further utilisation in industry. The concepts taken into account should yield novel products and process streams with a quality that is equal or better than the one of the available fossil analogues already on the market and where possible, provide opportunities to open new markets (e.g. development of novel products).
Proposals should target technologies (e.g. chemo/thermo/bio-catalytic technologies and fermentation), which can include recovery, and primary (e.g. sugars, lignin, tannins, resins, proteins) and/or secondary (e.g. furans, sugar acids, carboxylic acids, fatty acids and aromatics) processing of bio-resources, leading to bio- products and streams with high added value. The concepts are expected to provide significant added value creation in the process. Proposals are expected to address R&I activities covering the following areas:
Chemo/thermo/bio-catalytic technologies and fermentation route development for conversion processes as well as purification processes where needed, including mastering of the technology in order to yield (new) bio-based building blocks, polymers and chemicals and derived product portfolios in a relevant industrial environment.
Market analysis and techno-economical evaluation of the concepts proposed to assess the economic viability of the approaches and a business plan for the deployment of the technology.
The concepts should demonstrate improved resource efficiency based on Life Cycle Assessment, including a significant reduction of fossil resources and energy utilisation, as well as water and other utilities. The concepts should also bring a reduction in CO2 emissions compared to the commercially utilised process (or similar for new processes that do not have commercial analogues).
Proposals should envisage the demonstration of the concepts in an industrially relevant environment and show the potential for their integration into the relevant industrial sectors. An integrated waste management strategy, considering also industrial waste, will add value to the proposal. Demonstration of the integration in existing industrial scenarios would be a major added-value. The demonstration activities are expected to address the scalability and replicability of the proposed concepts.
Activities are expected to focus on Technology Readiness Levels 5 to 7 and to be centred around TRL 6.
A significant participation of SMEs with R&D capacities is encouraged.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU between EUR 5 and 7 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
The concepts proposed should provide a decreased utilisation of fossil resources in the process industry of at least 30 % compared to similar commercially available processes.
The concepts proposed should provide an improvement in energy utilisation in the process industry of at least 30 % compared to similar commercially available processes.
The concepts proposed should provide a decrease in CO2 emissions of at least 30% compared to similar commercially available processes.
The economic viability of the concepts should be demonstrated, as well as the contribution to the long term sustainability of the industrial sectors targeted.
The proposal should provide a clear business case for the deployment of the solutions in industry.
Proposals should include a business case and exploitation strategy, as outlined in the Introduction to the LEIT part of this Work Programme.

","Research and Innovation action
","15 October 2015
","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Industrial furnaces with higher performances, optimised resource and energy efficiencies and less pollutant emissions are a major goal for combustion researchers, furnace producers and the process industries. Relatively few new furnaces are installed in Europe these days due to the capital intensive nature of the industrial furnaces, which makes this challenge more urgent to overcome.
In addition, most of the industrial furnaces in Europe are currently fed with natural gas. Another challenge in the coming years will be the use of alternative energy sources or hybrid heating systems for such applications. Novel designs based on new technical concepts, materials and different combustion routes and processes are key for new advanced furnaces and the retrofitting of existing ones.
The development of a clear understanding of the process function, the reliability of the process information and how the furnace interacts with the rest of the manufacturing process will be paramount for the new generation of technologies for new and retrofitted industrial furnaces. To develop and to scale up new systems and equipment based on new high temperature materials and advance protective coatings is a real challenge and could contribute to great savings in energy.
Scope:
Proposals need to consider all aspects for the construction of new furnaces or the retrofitting of existing furnaces with more efficient and effective technologies. They need to also consider the effects on upstream and downstream processes linked to those heating systems.
The design methods and criteria need to take into account technical aspects, constraints found in legislation, compliance with codes and standards and all the related economic aspects, including how the cost of design changes can escalate.
Research activities for new industrial furnace design or the retrofitting of existing furnaces should address all of the following areas:
Use of at least two different energy sources, e.g. electricity, gas, oil, biogas, biomass, coal. Hybrid heating systems can also be considered. Design has to take into consideration the type of feed and an optimised fuel consumption.
Prediction tools and computer simulation development applied to the design process and performance prediction.
Interaction of the furnace with the rest of the manufacturing process, including the effect on upstream and downstream processes. Optimisation has to be considered at system level. Heat transfer and recovery need to be also considered.
Improved equipment efficiency by using new and improved high temperature/corrosion/wear resistance materials e.g. new steels, super alloys, high resistance composite metallic alloys, innovative refractories, high temperature insulation materials systems, hybrid metallic/ceramic solutions for high temperature applications.
Monitoring and control systems for the SOx, NOx and CO emission of industrial furnaces
The proposals must include at least one demonstrator in an industry-relevant environment, for either new or existing furnaces.
Activities are expected to focus on Technology Readiness Levels 4 to 6. This topic addresses cross-KET activities.
This topic is particularly suitable for SMEs.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU between EUR 5 and 7 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
Compared to the current practice in the sector:
Reduce the energy consumption by at least 15%.
Reduce the operating costs by at least 15%.
Reduce NOx, SOx and CO emission by at least 25%.
Reduce Capex and Opex costs of the furnaces by at least 15%.
Clear business cases for the deployment of the solutions in industry.

Specific challenge:The reduction of the number of steps and unit operations in industrial processes is a key factor in achieving process intensification, improving the efficiency in the use of resources, and reducing the impact on the environment. Continuous scalable processes using intensified equipment are key to enable flexible and decentralised production at high process performance.
Scope:Projects should develop new adaptable reactor concepts to reduce the number of process steps and unit operations for industrially relevant processes, by the redesign and merging of critical reaction steps and subsequent process steps, such as separation and work-up or by allowing new operating windows that are not accessible using conventional equipment. Projects should include the design of the corresponding reactor equipment, in close co-operation of the engineering and equipment manufacturing sectors with process industries.
Application areas targeted include new adaptable catalytic schemes; or reactors and processes allowing for operation at high pressure and/or temperature for a substantially increased space time yield.
The integration and optimisation in relation to full process engineering assessment should be explored. The impact of the new process solutions should be proven through process modelling and assessment, and quantified in terms of resource intensity reduction as well as reduction of emissions. Depending on the scale of the industrial processes included in the project, it would be beneficial to consider their implementation within modular or containerised set-ups. 
For this topic, proposals should include an outline of the initial exploitation and business plans, which will be developed further in the proposal project.

Dissemination, exploitation and transfer of projects results are important activities during project life-time and beyond in order to make sure that projects fully achieve the expected impacts. Clustering of project activities, according to specific objectives and addressed themes, and their inter-linking with existing technology transfer activities, are effective ways to stimulate the take-up of project results and to exploit synergies. Further, there is a need to focus on knowledge transfer and training issues regarding present and future industrial workers in the whole value chain, for which a strong link between industry and academia is needed.
An adequate exploitation of such activities together with a joint analysis of the results obtained and the training needs during the project lifetime and beyond is also needed, to ensure an effective implementation at the PPP level.
Scope:
Proposals should aim in particular to actively cluster existing activities under the SPIRE PPP that go beyond the exploitation and dissemination activities of each project. The initiative, which is expected to last 2 years, will require close collaboration with relevant industrial associations, technology and knowledge transfer programmes as well as the training community.
The project should aim at looking for new ways of engaging with the broader process community, and encouraging engagement with other networks in the process industry (e.g. regional networks).
Activities may include:
Moving beyond traditional dissemination activities and favour the development of tailored innovative dissemination actions and initiatives inspired by project outcomes and targeted at specific stakeholders (incl. SMEs, learning community).
Sharing insights on innovative business model concepts for implementing resource and energy efficient solutions, including cradle to cradle and industrial symbiosis approaches.
Identification of gaps and opportunities for further research and innovation, as well as non-technological gaps in order to develop policy framework recommendations (e.g. regulation, standardization, public procurement).
Workshops with top-ranked international experts from the various disciplines aiming at the elaboration of future SPIRE priorities and training needs within the technological area of the cluster.
Building skills capacity for innovation and competitiveness in the process industry (e.g. engaging with the academia for the development of learning resources adaptable to different learning approaches and curricula at undergraduate, master, and life-long learning levels, based in particular on the innovation outcome of projects).
Reviews of recent technological developments, publications, international RTD and innovation programmes within the technological area of the cluster.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU between EUR 250000 and 500000 would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.

","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
It is essential to take advantage of the significant potential benefits from new technologies and materials while ensuring that there are mechanisms in place to prevent, identify and manage any potential risks associated with certain use of such technologies.
The European regulatory process should also instil consumer confidence in the approved marketed products and encourage the reduction of production costs and the increase of efficiency, improving of the quality of products and services, ensuring worker health and safety, and protecting the environment in order to keep jobs and a competitive economy. At the same time, regulatory bottlenecks to innovation in the process industry should be identified in order to ensure that innovative processes, technologies and products in the areas of circular economy, resource and energy efficiency can be introduced on the market in a faster timeframe.
In addition, many production plants, companies and industrial parks are presently using their own protocols and standards, which in many cases do not match those used by other similar companies. This means that it can be difficult to perform cross-sectorial technology transfer and thereby achieve efficiency improvements.
Before any changes in policies are considered, a very careful and well-thought analysis should be undertaken in order to minimise the risk of potential negative impact on innovation and on the uptake of technology.
Scope:
A clear, consistent and predictable regulatory framework is needed, as well as a set of standards. Proposed support actions should cover the needs of the different industrial sectors representing big and small companies within the process industry. Their objective should be to identify and to propose solutions along the value chain, required to reach long term sustainability for Europe in terms of global competitiveness, ecology and employment.
The evaluation of current policies and regulatory or standardisation needs could include recommendations within the following areas:
Re-use of different grades of wastewater for industrial purposes.
Re-use of different types of waste (e.g. through re-classification) as feed for industrial production and/or energy sources.
Recovery of valuable materials, metals and minerals from waste.
Lifecycle Assessment methodologies to allow a harmonised comparison between industries and sectors.
Production of advanced renewable fuels from the use of CO2 as feedstock.
General harmonisation of the European Waste, Water and Energy policies.
Eliminating bottlenecks for the transferability of new technologies across European borders.
Eliminating bottlenecks that prevent the stimulation of investments in new technologies, e.g. within clean and low carbon technologies.
New standardisation methodologies that facilitate continuous production.
While in some cases it is necessary to recommend harmonisation on a European scale through regulation and European standards, in other cases it may only be necessary to enable transferability of technology across sectorial boundaries.
Examples for this could be (but are not restricted to) the following:
IT control systems and plant monitoring systems facilitating industrial symbiosis.
Equipment for Process Intensification.
Equipment for small scale localised production.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU between EUR 500000 and 1000000 would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
No more than one action will be funded.

","12 March 2020
","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Innovation for border and external security may draw, in particular, from novel technologies, provided that they are affordable, accepted by citizens and customized and implemented for the needs of security practitioners.
Scope:
Proposals are invited to address related research and innovation issues, in particular:
Sub-topic 1: [2018] Providing integrated situational awareness and applying augmented reality to border security
Currently, information is made available to border and coast guards in several formats and on different kinds of hardly interoperable displays. However, human cognitive is limited at managing information from several sources simultaneously and at handling too many separate pieces of equipment is a limit to their ability to act. Furthermore, border and coast guards often work in sparsely populated and remote areas where the availability of telecommunication networks may be an issue. Research and innovation should lead towards (cloud-based) integrated systems with simple but complete and highly-standardized interfaces showing real-time information in a user-friendly way that can assist border guards in decision-making, and in remaining in contact with their command and control centre in the actual context of operations. Water, land and air operating resources should be taken into account, to lead to enhanced concept of employment, integration and interoperability standards.
Sub-topic 2: [2018] Detecting fraud, verifying document validity, and alternative technologies to identifying people
The use of counterfeit travel documents at borders is a reality, which entails the risk of not identifying known criminals, including terrorists. It is a cross-cutting priority according to the EU Serious and Organised Crime Threat Assessment 2017[1], since it enables or enhances all types of serious and organized crime and terrorism. New countermeasures are needed to address potential frauds, in particular for the detection of morphed face images. The use of biometrics ""on the fly"" techniques for identification in a non-intrusive manner and without interrupting the flow of people is an area for further development, testing and validation.
Sub-topic 3: [2019] Security on-board passenger ships
Security on-board passenger ships is challenging, given the larger number of specific constraints that apply. To ensure security all along the ""life cycle"" of a voyage, new technologies can be implemented (together with methods for their deployment and possibly their integration into ship systems), as well as security novel procedures (including for embarkation and disembarkation, mooring at pier, etc.)
Sub-topic 4: [2019] Detecting threats in the stream of commerce without disrupting business
The flow of goods crossing borders is increasing, whilst ways of concealing methods for dangerous materials and illegally trafficked goods are improving. The detection of such dangerous and illegal goods should be facilitated by novel technologies and sensing strategies characterized by risk-based protection and non-intrusive security checks that can be implemented without disrupting business.
Proposals should target the automation and integration of existing technologies for the purpose of identifying the largest possible amount of threat materials and ensuring the full supervision of the logistic flow of goods. This would require exploiting information obtained through the analysis of cargo flow data available from open source and documentary control, intelligence gathering, risk management, as well as through physical detection or inspection of cargo in means of transport, luggage, or carried by individuals. The fitness for purpose of novel solutions should be validated at the EU external border, in a context chosen on the basis of a sound and factual risk analysis.
Of particular relevance: the enhancement of detection capabilities of contraband (mainly cigarettes) hidden in high density cargo (coal, iron ore) in particular for rail cargo transport, and well as the fight against illicit trafficking of radioactive and nuclear (NR) materials (including through the establishment of trans-European network of detection facilities with its specific concept of operations.
Sub-topic 5: [2020] Disruptive technologies for non-intrusive identification of hidden goods
Detecting and identifying illegal goods hidden in containers, train cars and truck structures at EU external borders (e.g. ports, wharfs, rail yards, …) is a need shared by border guard, customs and law enforcement authorities. Illegal goods, including drugs, weapons, explosives, radiological and nuclear material, are trafficked into Europe by criminal organisations using a range of methods and tools, which are very diverse (e.g. to minimize the risk of detection during transportation, some drugs may be transformed into a liquid and turned back into a solid at destination) and adaptable to specific border conditions. These may also include taking advantage of new technology to facilitate access to containers.
Research should focus on the use of improved sensing technologies. The availability of a system of sensors producing a highly detailed, user friendly, 3-dimensional insight into the internal structure of a container (or truck), and the type of cargo carried, in a limited amount of time, would in particular be a valuable disruptive innovation for the customs and border inspection community. The system of sensors should be suitable for deployment and operation in a flexible and relocatable way, including mechanisms to improve field usability. The system should also allow for a swift gathering and exchange of information with other systems in order to facilitate a faster and more accurate localisation and identification of illicit cargo, without the need to open containers (this being a clear improvement when compared to current capabilities).
In line with the above, the newly developed solutions should allow for interoperability with state of the art and with foreseeable future border and customs information systems in order to optimise the overall container screening process using a risk-based approach.
Proposals should conduct testing and validation in the relevant environment.
Sub-topic: [2018-2019-2020] Open
Proposals addressing other issues relevant to this challenge, based on a sound rationale and supported by a large number of relevant practitioners are invited to apply under this sub-topic (see eligibility and admissibility conditions.)
Proposals should lead to solutions developed, tested, and validated in compliance with European societal values, fundamental rights and applicable legislation, including in the area of free movement of persons, privacy and protection of personal data. Societal aspects (e.g. perception of security, possible side effects of technological solutions, societal resilience) have to be addressed in a comprehensive and thorough manner.
The centre of gravity for technology development with actions funded under this topic is expected to be up to TRL 5 to 6 – see General Annex G of the Horizon 2020 Work Programme.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of about EUR 7 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Satellite communications is an important tool for public authorities active in domains such as border surveillance and management, crisis and disaster management, detecting and monitoring forest fires, monitoring and controlling illegal activities, protection of critical infrastructures, and humanitarian aid. This is particularly the case when ground-based communication links are damaged (e.g. earthquakes, hurricanes), absent (such as in remote areas or in the maritime domain), or cannot be trusted (e.g. in Common Security and Defence operations outside the EU). In many of those domains public authorities require secure and guaranteed access to satellite communications. However, many governmental users (e.g. fire brigades, civil protection workers, and border management actors) are currently not benefitting from the full potential in the domain of satellite communications. Research and innovation actions, in particular in terms of user technologies, interoperability and standards need to be developed early enough to enable governmental users to profit from the increasing governmental satellite communications services.
Scope:
A network of governmental users of secure satellite communications shall be set up with the aim to establish collaboration on aspects in the user domain of governmental satellite communications, such as research and innovation on user equipment, the study and comparison of existing and innovative use-cases, interoperability and standardisation. The network shall also identify and share good practices in the deployment and use of satellite communications by governmental actors in the Member States and in EU institutions, agencies and entities.
Activities shall be tailored to the priorities of governmental satellite communications users, including, inter alia
Survey of available satcom user equipment, future user technologies, and potential need for standardisation;
The study and comparison of existing and innovative use-cases and evolving user needs and requirements, and where relevant and feasible, associated tests in laboratory or field test environments;
Consolidated long-term roadmap and coordination plan for research and innovation relating to secure governmental satellite communication;
Workshops, in particular involving relevant entities who are not participants of the consortium;
Specific training linked to satellite communications, for example to share good practices;
Cross-border twinning schemes, such as field tests.
Special attention will be given to enhance the competence of potential users in the domain of secure satellite communications, including helping less experienced users to rapidly acquire the know-how accumulated in other countries.
The participation to the network of national representatives appointed by EU Member States, responsible for federating and coordinating the inputs from the respective national civilian users, is mandatory. They shall cooperate with relevant EU agencies and entities involved in the use of satellite communications or user equipment (e.g. Frontex, GSA, EMSA, ENISA, CEPOL, Europol, Eurojust, EDA, SATCEN, EEAS, JRC).
The Commission considers that one proposal requesting a contribution from the EU in the range of EUR 3 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
This topic contributes to the Horizon 2020 focus area ""Boosting the effectiveness of the Security Union "".
Expected Impact:
Common understanding of user needs, and potential for innovation, including interoperability, and standardisation in the use of satellite communications by EU and Member State users.
Enhanced synergies in the uptake of governmental satellite communication solutions among users from different disciplines, backgrounds and Member States.
More efficient use of investments made across the EU in demonstrating, testing and training governmental satellite communication users.
Outputs from this project may benefit future EU programmes in this domain."

","Research and Innovation action
","24 March 2015
","single-stage
Deadline date","Scope:
Specific challenge: Automation could hold the key to significant performance improvements across many aspects of ATM, which today relies on high levels of human intervention. Uptake of automation has been slow partly because the benefits of human cognitive abilities, especially in safety-critical situations, have provided strong arguments against change. The current spur of innovation in robotics and autonomy[1], within advanced industrial and service sectors, may extend more traditional notions of automation to potentially open up new fields of research. Since there is expected to be a significant increase in the numbers and types of aerial vehicles in operation, including remotely piloted vehicles, the scope for a new generation of autonomous automation solutions is significant.
The challenge is therefore to develop automation solutions that have the capability to provide substantial and verifiable performance benefits whilst fully addressing safety and security concerns. Research should fully take into account expected future technical and institutional developments together with forecast. In addition, the SESAR-sponsored HALA! Network has been considering key issues of higher-levels of automation for ATM and its output should be considered as useful reference material.
Scope: Proposals for research in this area should take an ambitious view of automation. Projects may look to build upon the existing legacy, or they could take a clean-sheet approach to design an ATM system that requires human intervention in a supervisory or control mode rather than in a direct operating mode. The latter ‘unconstrained’ line of attack should allow a bolder vision and open the door for new conceptual possibilities. Under this topic there is substantial scope for learning from other transportation modes and other industries, particularly where robotics and autonomy are concerned.
Research may address any part of the ATM system from strategic planning through airport operations (including small and medium airports) to tactical air traffic control and collision avoidance. Research is also needed to support the integration of new and diverse aircraft types, including remotely piloted vehicles. The integration of RPAS or highly autonomous aerial vehicles provides a number of automation challenges requiring new supervision and control paradigms which could extend to such developments as multiple simultaneous control and swarm dynamics.
Other related aspects that can also be considered within the scope of this topic include notably:
    non-physical autonomous systems such as software designed to monitor the safety, integrity and performance of complex socio-technical systems, and
    new approaches to optimisation applied to different aspects of ATM operations. .
Increased dependence on automation makes it important to consider automation failure scenarios, system resilience and the challenge of maintaining a skilled and competent workforce. There will be a need to address some of the human performance issues for ATC similar to those that are known to affect flight-crew performance in the glass cockpit. These include the need to prevent the risks associated to moving the human operator into a monitoring role: stress, lack of attention, loss of situational awareness and de-skilling. Research may look into potential strategies to mitigate these risks, like the use of adaptable or adaptive automation schemes in order to both prevent controller de-skilling and maintain minimum workload levels that will ensure controllers’ attention stays engaged at all times.
An improved understanding of complex failure modes due to automation degradation, and its consequences on ATM performance, in SESAR’s system of systems could lead to new methodologies and architectural guidance for future design of fail-safe complex environments in the presence of high automation.
Expected impact: This research will be expected to demonstrate and quantify the potential for higher levels of automation to provide benefits in safety, capacity, efficiency and security of ATM operations. Potential for improved cost-effectiveness or contributions to decision-support techniques notably during emergency situations may also be important outcomes.
Type of action: Research and Innovation Action (RIA).

","single-stage
Deadline date","Scope:
Specific challenge: Airports are a key part of the ATM network and airport capacity is identified as one of the major bottlenecks to aviation growth in Europe. As the pressure increases on airports, new technologies are emerging that may offer significant potential for improved situational awareness for tower controllers. In particular, an extension of applications and technologies developed for remote tower operations, already well advanced in the SESAR programme, may offer solutions for use in conventional environments with significant potential for safety improvements.
Scope: This research concerns new ways of displaying and presenting data on aircraft, vehicles and infrastructure in a manned airport visual control room. It may build on technologies being developed for remote tower operations or state-of the art from other domains (e.g. security) to present additional or augmented information on existing or new types of display including, for example, head-up displays.
Integration of sensor inputs with a 3D airport model has already been explored and the technique shows potential for use in ATM. For ground movements, existing 2D remote tower solutions may provide sufficient coverage and image quality to support advanced 3D tracking. This capability could potentially be used as a supplementary non-cooperative surveillance system for input to A-SMGCS on larger airports. In small airports, where surface movement radar is deemed too expensive, 3D modelling could provide a cost effective alternative. In all cases such techniques could be used to cover blind spots and be decision support tools during shortfall conditions.
Projects may investigate methods to increase the robustness of algorithms for computing object position, speed, direction and size. Projects may explore the combination of 2D object recognition algorithms and 3D information with behaviour models for better prediction of potential incursions. Such an implementation should provide for robust and trustworthy input to alarm systems that can reliably distinguish false-positives and be integrated with existing safety nets.
With appropriate distribution of 2D cameras and other basic sensors at small airports, a 3D model can be developed to provide precise positioning for aerial objects – a potential quick-win for both remote and non-remote tower systems. The technique could be extended to provide aerial surveillance and tracking enhancements for larger and more complex airports. Projects may study optimal camera and positioning to achieve these outcomes, together with their integration across other sensors that may already be available.
New and precise 3D airport computer models can lead to further developments of operational interest. For example, when linked to recent developments in meteorological models, wake vortex information could somehow be presented directly in the video stream to support optimal separation on approach.
Expected Impacts
The main impact of this research will be increased safety on the surface and in the air in the vicinity of the airport as well as cost savings. Other potential benefits for airport operations may be increased resilience and maintenance of capacity in poor conditions. It could be useful to larger airports that may currently implement A-SMGCS, but since the sensors will be relatively low-cost and independent it could be most useful for smaller airports that cannot afford expensive and complex systems.

","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
The challenge is to build a fully functional, bench-scale prototype of an artificial photosynthesis based system which is able to produce a useable synthetic fuel.
Artificial photosynthesis is widely considered to be among the most promising new technologies to deliver sustainable alternatives to current fuel supplies. Due to its ability to use a combination of sunlight, water and carbon from the air to produce energy, artificial photosynthesis is regarded as a potential breakthrough energy technology. It can be used to produce hydrogen or carbon-based fuels – collectively referred to as “solar fuels” – which offer an efficient and transportable means of storage of solar energy. Solar energy, in turn, can be used as an alternative to fossil fuels and as a feedstock for a wide range of industrial processes.
The device to be built needs to integrate the whole process from light capture to fuel production and be capable of powering a small engine. The production of fuel in the form of hydrogen and the use of conventional photovoltaic cells for the light harvesting process or to collect light and electrolysers are not permitted.
For the purpose of this prize, artificial photosynthesis (AP) is understood to be a process that aims at mimicking the physical chemistry of natural photosynthesis by absorbing solar energy in the form of photons. The solution is required to use this energy to generate fuel molecules through a synthetic system to be delivered as a single integrated device that utilises either biomimetic, nanotechnology, synthetic biology or a combination of these systems.
Meeting the challenge will stimulate innovation and focus research and development towards energy applications in a new energy technology through increased public and commercial interest. Moreover, it will accelerate the development of new innovative energy conversion systems using solar light and natural elements to produce renewable fuels to be used in industry, housing and transport.
The challenge will also create a stimulus for industrial participation and creation of start-ups, pushing the artificial photosynthesis technology for fuel production to the next level of development.
Considering the innovative approach and the novelty of using artificial photosynthesis for fuel production, the prize will generate interest in the subject and foster interdisciplinary collaboration among potential applicants, such as students, young researchers and engineers. The competition is expected to highlight the diversity of potential solutions.
The specific rules of the contest will be published in the fourth quarter of 2017 by the European Commission, which will directly launch and manage the contest and award the prize based on the judgement of independent experts.

A number of innovative devices and systems demonstrating the use of sunlight to produce a fuel ready to be used.

The Science Shop model of participatory research and innovation has been successful in bringing students, researchers and civil society together towards tackling real issues at the local and regional levels. Aside from positively impacting on the co-creation of solutions to real world problems, the process of engaging with society has strengthened both the research process and its outcomes, thereby contributing to research excellence and acceptability of innovation outcomes. It has also lead to improved teaching and learning methods in academia, which has benefitted both students and their teachers.
Scope:
This topic will provide support to universities, and other research performers, to establish or strengthen science shops throughout Europe, and beyond. Science shops will serve to demonstrate how students and researchers can assist communities tackle real life problems or explore opportunities for sustainable futures. In most cases, research questions will be derived by community partners.The Science Shops will provide an inclusive and safe space for participatory dialogue, citizen science and co-creation with a variety of actors including civil society, public authorities, SME, designers and innovators. This topic will also create opportunities for twinning, whereby well-established science shops provide guidance to universities keen on setting up new science shops. It will allow for joint visits, mutual learning, and the exchange of students and trainers, as well as summer schools. It it will compile an exhaustive database of case studies demonstrating the usefulness of the approach in multiple contexts, as well as their alignment with the RRI dimensions. Furthermore it will conduct a comparative assessment of science shops and assess the impacts they have had on their communities, and on the quality of teaching and research within the organisation. This topic shall seek to establish linkages with relevant international initiatives (e.g.: UNESCO Community-based research, Civic Universities, etc.). Particular attention will be placed on gender balance and the integration of gender in research. This topic shall benefit from the inclusion of SSH experts, and will support community processes favouring sustainable solutions.
In line with the strategy for EU international cooperation in research and innovation (COM(2012) 497), international cooperation is encouraged.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of the order of EUR 3 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
This action allows for the provision of financial support to third parties in line with the conditions set out in Part K of the General Annexes.
Expected Impact:
The research will promote the growth and capacity building of science shops for socially responsible community-based research and citizen science. It will provide means through which students, researchers and teaching staff may transfer their knowledge and skills for the benefit of their community, while at the same time ensuring their learning, teaching and research activities benefit from real-life cases and interactions.

At the moment, Europe faces a shortfall in science-knowledgeable people at all levels of society. This is a good time to expand opportunities for science learning, in formal, non-formal and informal settings[1]. Evidence shows that European citizens, young and old, appreciate the importance of science and want to be more informed, and that citizens want more science education. Over 40% believe science and technological innovation can have a positive impact on the environment, health and medical care, and basic infrastructure in the future[2]. Therefore, collaboration between formal, non-formal and informal science education providers, enterprises and civil society should be enhanced to ensure relevant and meaningful engagement of all societal actors with science and increase the uptake of science studies, citizen science initiatives and science-based careers, employability and competitiveness.
Scope:
The proposed action targets the creation of new partnerships in local communities to foster improved science education for all citizens. This action aims to support a range of activities based on collaboration between formal, non-formal and informal science education providers, enterprises and civil society in order to integrate the concept of open schooling, including all educational levels, in science education.

Relevant policy makers should also be involved, to encourage policy buy-in and the mainstreaming of good practices and insights into policies, and hence sustainability and impact beyond the lifetime of funding. Partnerships that foster expertise, networking, sharing and applying science and technology research findings across different enterprises (e.g. start-ups, SMEs, larger corporations) should be promoted. Gender, socio-economic and geographical differences should be considered.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of the order of € 1.50 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
It is expected that in the short term the development of partnerships between schools, local communities, Civil Society Organisations, universities and industry should contribute to a more scientifically interested and literate society and students with a better awareness of and interest in scientific careers. In the medium term the activities should provide citizens and future researchers with the tools and skills to make informed decisions and choices and in the long-term this action should contribute towards the ERA objectives of increasing the numbers of scientists and researchers in Europe.

Deadline date","Scope:
The Horizon Prize for collaborative spectrum sharing is a €500 000 challenge prize. It will be awarded to an innovative and disruptive approach which will enable a significant increase in spectrum sharing and re-use, beyond the currently applicable spectrum sharing methods and centralised techniques. The winning solution should be a significant step forward from current technologies and solutions in terms of shared spectrum usage metrics and will have to prove its economic viability. The feasibility of the approach will have to be demonstrated through clear experimental results.
 OBJECTIVES
 The objectives are:
 •           To tackle the expected capacity crunch of wireless networks faced with booming traffic and usages;
•           To provide innovative yet implementable solutions enabling a significant efficiency improvement in the usage of scarce spectrum resources;
•           To reward excellence in demonstrating one or several innovative methods focusing on the provision of empowerment of local user communities with decentralised spectrum management capabilities;
•           To address the lack of demonstrated system capabilities of disruptive spectrum access and sharing methods, which go beyond the traditional cellular evolution and database, based sharing methods;
•           To foster experimental R&D and early proof-of-concept development to encourage innovation, business, and regulation in the domain of collaborative sharing of spectrum.
 EXPECTED RESULTS
 This prize will lead to a significant amount of research and potentially demonstrated capabilities of disruptive spectrum access and sharing methods, which go beyond the traditional cellular evolution and centralised sharing approaches.
 It will contribute to the development of low cost, energy efficient systems solutions that will increase the efficient use of spectrum resources for enabling new services and driving the development of wireless systems.
 It will also help overcoming the heterogeneous nature of spectrum access implementation in Europe. It will demonstrate societal and economic benefits for Europe with a clear innovation potential, business opportunities, and where applicable, required modernisation of European regulation in the domain of collaborative sharing of spectrum."

Gender equality is a key priority of the European Research Area. The Communication ""A Reinforced European Research Area: Partnership for Excellence and Growth"" invites research performing organisations (RPOs), including Higher Education Institutions, as well as research funding organisations (RFOs) to take action to promote gender equality in R&I by implementing institutional changes relating to HR management, funding, decision-making and research programmes through Gender Equality Plans, with the following objectives :
Removing barriers to the recruitment, retention and career progression of female researchers;
• Addressing gender imbalances in decision making processes;
• Strengthening the gender dimension in research programmes.
Scope:
The action provides support to RPOs and RFOs in order to implement Gender Equality Plans (GEPs) as ""drivers"" for systemic institutional changes. The proposed GEPs structure must address the following:
• Conduct assessment / audit of procedures and practices, including relevant data on HR management, teaching and research activities, in order to identify gender bias at organisation level;
• Implement effective strategies to address gender bias; this shall include actions such as family-friendly policies (e.g. work schedule’s flexibility; parental leave; mobility, dual-career couples), gender planning and budgeting, training on gender equality in Human Resources (HR) management, the integration of gender dimension in research content and programmes and/or the inclusion of gender studies in Higher Education Institution curricula;
• Set targets and monitor progress via indicators at organisation level.
The proposals must include a first assessment of gender issues in each partner organisation. Based on this assessment, effective strategies will be designed to cover organisational features, people and processes, as well as potential impacts.
The proposals shall also explain the planned GEPs in the context of existing national provisions (national legislation, specific incentives, possible barriers, etc) relating to gender equality in research. They shall explain how they will contribute to the achievement of the European Research Area (ERA) objectives on gender equality.
The RPOs - including Higher Education Institutions- and RFOs, involved as partners in the consortium must be at a starting/initial stage in the setting-up of gender equality plans. The allocation of resources within the consortium shall focus on the implementation of GEPs in the partner organisations. If a limited number of other partners which are not implementing GEP's are part of the consortium, they shall explain their role and their specific contribution to the project in line with the text and requirements of the call.
The proposals shall ensure the support from their highest management level and provide proof of their commitment in the implementation of GEPs. The role of the middle management in the implementation of the GEPs shall be explained.
Participation of RFOs and professional associations in the consortium is recommended.
The proposals shall include a methodology for impartially evaluating the progress made on gender equality plans throughout the duration of the project. The methodology for the evaluation should be thought as formative, helping the partners to adapt their GEP's as necessary. This activity could be dedicated to a specific partner organisation within the consortium with the appropriate expertise or it can be subcontracted. Specific work package and deliverable(s) should be introduced in the proposal.
Project duration of at least 48 months is recommended.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 1.5 million and 2.03 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
This action allows for the provision of financial support to third parties in line with the conditions set out in Part K of the General Annexes.
Expected Impact:
The proposed action will contribute to increase the number of RPOs and RFOs starting to implement gender equality plans pursuing the three objectives mentioned above under ""specific challenge"". In the medium to long term, activities will contribute to the achievement of ERA in particular by increasing the number of female researchers, improving their careers and mobility. The integration of the gender dimension in research programmes and content will contribute to the quality of research and the social value of innovations.

","13 April 2016
","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
This topic focuses on the institutional changes needed to cope with the new interactions between Research Funding and Performing Organisations (RFPOs) and RRI stakeholders. Existing RFPOs become more “porous”, accepting inputs from what used to be seen as outsiders (extended peer review in funding agencies is an early example). There is a move towards “co-creation” (co-construction in policy and design phases; actual co-production of research organization and performance; co-evaluation of proposals, projects and programmes). Overall, at the macro-level, so-called quadruple helix formations might be emerging, RRI dimensions being an integral part of these developments.
Within the general trend, the dissemination of RRI practices varies from one discipline to another and from one country to another. Not all researchers and research policy-makers have the same knowledge and skills to adapt to these changes. In order to address these gaps specific trainings for researchers and academics (in particular young scientist during under- and post-graduate training) but also policy-makers and staff working in funding bodies, need to be supported.
Scope:
From the perspective of an open science and RRI in the ERA, the above developments are desirable, so it is important to support institutional changes through exchanges between RFPOs in order to benchmark governance settings, map what is happening, identify the drivers and the barriers, how to diagnose the interests and values at stake, and upgrade related skills.
Proposals shall consider co-creation experiences and experiments, some of them being conflictual and/or leading to controversies. They will also consider further issues, in particular of a longitudinal epistemological nature, as different competencies and epistemic authority are involved. They can as well design experiments and try them out, informed by the above reflective components (i.e. benchmarking, mapping, drivers and barriers, interests and values).
In addition, the proposals will support the improvement and consolidation of training material and reach through training the highest number of stakeholders in the European Research Area. The training actions proposed must be relevant for the specific scientific fields considered. They must be practical, engaging, and outcome-oriented. They would use as much as possible existing EC funded training initiatives (e.g. RRI-TOOLS[1], FOSTER[2], not excluding others). Online didactic material and training toolkits will be made available free of charge/open access for re-use linked with existing online material.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 3 and 3.35 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
This action allows for the provision of financial support to third parties in line with the conditions set out in Part K of the General Annexes.
.
Expected Impact:
The funded activities:
Will enrich and improve the quality of existing training materials on RRI and open science;
Will increase general knowledge on RRI and open science practices by sharing experience across different disciplines;
Will contribute to changes in RFPOs governance settings (including institutional changes and stakeholder behaviours) that are consistent with open science and RRI.

","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
European research still suffers from persistent barriers and constraints to gender equality in the recruitment, advancement and mobility of scientists in the European scientific system, as well as the lack of women in decision-making and the unbalanced representation in the evaluation process of research projects. Statistical evidence suggests that research funding success rates are higher for male than for female researchers. The gender dimension also needs to be further integrated in research programmes and contents. The ERA Progress report 2014 indicates that there are wide disparities among Member States in their awareness and acknowledgement of direct and indirect gender discriminations in research systems as well as in the means they mobilise to overcome them. The challenge is to improve on all these points and advance towards completing the European Research Area in the field of gender equality in research and innovation.
Scope:
A first ERA-NET on gender equality in R&I policy called GENDER-NET was funded under FP7 for the period 2013-2016. It helped mapping and analysing existing national and regional programmes and initiatives aiming at promoting gender equality through institutional change in research organisations, as well as the gender dimension in research contents and programmes. It also aimed at developing common indicators for the monitoring of gender equality policies, and identifying priority activities for strategic transnational cooperation.
On the basis of the priorities identified by GENDER-NET, collaboration will be further supported between Member States and Associated Countries, their research programmes and their initiatives addressing the shared challenges described above.
The ERA-NET Cofund action shall extend the partnership to other Member States and Associated Countries, and enlarge the mapping and analysis to these new partners. Moreover, joint assessments will be extended to the quantitative and qualitative analysis of gender differences and bias in access to research grants. The ERA-NET Cofund action shall help define and develop appropriate conditions for equal opportunities in research funding.
The ERA-NET Cofund action will also launch, co-fund, and monitor strategic transnational cooperation/ actions in support of the implementation of the ERA objectives and based on the priorities identified by GENDER-NET, both from the angle of institutional change in research performing and funding organisations and in view of integrating the gender dimension in research programmes and contents. Priorities may include initiatives such as support to gender equality plans, and development of monitoring systems and of evaluation strategies.
Monitoring arrangements, including indicators, shall be further developed and used.
Proposals should pool the necessary financial resources from the participating national (or regional) research programmes with a view to implementing a joint call for proposals resulting in grants to third parties with EU co-funding, aiming at institutional change and integrating the gender dimension in research contents.
Proposers are encouraged to include other joint activities including additional joint calls without EU co-funding.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of the order of EUR 5 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
This action allows for the provision of financial support to third parties in line with the conditions set out in Part K of the General Annexes.
Expected Impact:
The ERA-NET Cofound action is expected to strengthen the development of gender equality measures in research and innovation across the EU and consequently improve the overall research productivity. Through mutual learning, it will improve the implementation of research and innovation programmes and monitoring of gender equality policies.
The ERA-NET Cofound action will help overcome the disparities among countries and implement appropriate conditions for equal opportunities in the research programmes of the participating countries. It will foster closer cooperation and greater pooling of resources between regional, national and EU-wide research programmes. By mobilising Member States and Associated Countries funding and scaling it up, it will contribute to the implementation of the gender priority of the ERA Roadmap.

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
In order to maximise the quality and societal impact of research, integrity[1] should be an integral part throughout the research and innovation process and more generally within the scientific system, rather than being considered as an add-on and as a means of creating additional red tape. The new European code of conduct for research integrity[2] is unambiguous: ""It is of crucial importance that researchers master the knowledge, methodologies and ethical practices associated with their field"".
Traditional methods of teaching ethics and research integrity do not appear to be efficient in raising awareness on these issues. There is consequently a need to develop innovative educational methods, engaging all those who are directly (e.g. young and senior researchers) or indirectly (e.g. pupils at all levels of education, educators and students educated in technical laboratory support studies) involved in research. In particular, the needs of two groups should be addressed: that of adolescents, and that of university students and early career researchers.
Scope:
On the basis of existing successful educational practices, the action will develop and test innovative educational student-centred methods (formal and informal) aiming to promote a culture of research integrity and raise awareness of students and early career researchers. The above mentioned code of conduct for research integrity will be the reference document to be used as the basis for the proposed methodology. Different curricula and educational tools and methods should be developed for two groups: the first group will be composed of secondary school students; the second will be composed of undergraduate and graduate students in relevant fields (including technical education students) as well as early career researchers.
The curricula should be interactive, aiming to engage students and early career researchers in a dialogue. Such curricula should be adapted to the age of the students and take into account the gender dimension. The curricula may include, for example, drama, role play, service learning, case studies, debates, position papers and presentations as well as e-learning methods. These curricula should allow for plurality of opinions and for nuances, rather than a set of predetermined ""right or wrong"" answers.
The work will also cover the design of training programmes for educators that will be responsible for implementing the curricula. The work should be based (amongst others) on (i) a mapping of other existing innovative teaching techniques and (ii) an analysis of the benefits and potential impact of the proposed methodology compared to existing educational practices. The action will take into account and build on the output of the research projects financed by this Science with and for Society programme that covers training and educational aspects of research integrity (e.g. PRINTEGER, ENERI[3], project funded via SwafS-27-2017).
Close cooperation with the European Network of Research Ethics and Research Integrity is required.
In line with the strategy for EU international cooperation in research and innovation (COM (2012)479), international cooperation is encouraged.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of the order of EUR 2.50 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
The implementation of this action will improve current educational methods, raise awareness of students and early career researchers and contribute to the establishment of a research integrity culture. The innovative methods for teaching research integrity developed by this project will improve short and long-term educational and training results and will contribute to the responsible conduct of research and research excellence.

[1]Research integrity should be here understood in its wide meaning, in particular as the respect of principles and practices which ensure a responsible conduct or research. It therefore covers the necessity to adhere to the highest ethics standards, notably related to the duty of care, in designing, performing, publishing, reviewing and communicating research.

","Research and Innovation action
","05 December 2017
","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
All research builds on former work and depends on scientists' possibilities to access and share scientific information. In the context of Open Science and Responsible Research and Innovation the European Commission therefore strongly supports the optimal open access to and re-use of research data (considering e.g. robust opt-outs). As a concrete action the EC has extended the Open Research Data Pilot to cover all areas of Horizon 2020 (as of the 2017 Work Programme). This will result in more data becoming available for re-use. However, it is necessary to adopt further actions to reach the Commission's overall objective of findable, accessible, interoperable and re-usable (FAIR) data by 2020.
Scope:
The action will identify one or several areas of research where FAIR data is not yet common practice and what the different barriers are (e.g. technical, legal, behavioural) as well as how to overcome them, covering both publicly funded entities and business actors. It will provide support to make data FAIR, in particular to address the quality of data (e.g. certification), its interoperability and its reproducibility.
The action will identify one or several areas of research funded in Horizon 2020 where sufficient and high-quality research data is available. The action will generate pathfinder case studies for innovative sharing and re-use of research data by publicly funded entities as well as business actors, which demonstrate how data sharing and data re-use can generate a ground breaking innovative product, service, or treatment. Furthermore, the action will financially support the generation of a prototype of such a product, device, service, or treatment. If relevant, the action will support trans/cross-disciplinary research data re-use in this endeavour. For the pathfinder case studies preference should be given to research data generated with EU funding, in particular in Horizon 2020 and, as far as available, previous framework programmes[1].
To address this specific challenge, proposals may benefit from a broad coverage. It is therefore suggested that consortia could include at least entities from 10 different Member States or Associated Countries, although smaller consortia will also be eligible and may be selected.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of the order of EUR 3.00 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
The action will increase the visibility of the Commission's open FAIR data policy (extended Open Research Data Policy) and the research data which has become available as a result through a) dedicated communication activities, and b) networking of relevant actors with a cross-and inter-disciplinary perspective, including industry.
The re-use of research data generated with public funding is expected to have a beneficial impact for science, the economy and society. The wider accessibility of results is expected to increase the reproducibility of research. Additionally, re-use of research data can cross-fertilise interdisciplinary research, which is essential for addressing the grand challenges of our time. It can also boost citizen science. Furthermore, enabling the re-use of research data is expected to create added value for innovative companies (including SMEs and start-ups) which form the bed rock of the digital single market.
The Key Performance Indicators are the following:
Increase in FAIR data in those domains identified by the beneficiaries for action
Contribution of the pathfinder case studies to innovative data sharing and re-use

Gender equality is a key priority set with the Member States and Associated countries in the European Research Area. Research funding and performing organisations, including universities, are invited to implement institutional change through Gender Equality Plans (GEPs). The Council conclusions of 1 December 2015[1] acknowledged the contribution of gender equality to the quality of research and innovation. It reaffirmed the need for sustainable cultural and institutional change along the three following objectives:
Removing barriers to the recruitment, retention and career progression of women researchers;
Addressing gender imbalances in decision making processes;
Integrating the gender dimension in research and innovation content[2].
The GEAR tool developed by the European Commission and EIGE[3] regrouped the state of the art knowledge and practices on institutional change and provided a step-by-step guide on how to set up and implement GEPs.
Scope:
The action should focus on implementing Gender Equality Plans (GEPs) in research funding organisations and research performing organisations including universities, as ""drivers"" for systemic institutional changes. The GEPs should be developed using a coherent approach, referring to the GEAR tool step-by-step guide. The proposed GEPs structure will include at least the following:
Conduct assessment / audit of procedures and practices with relevant data to identify gender bias at organisation level;
Implement effective actions to be developed over time, according to the identified bias;
Set targets and monitor progress via indicators at organisation level.
The proposals will explain the planned GEPs in the context of existing national provisions and national action plans and strategies (legislation, specific incentives, etc.) relating to gender equality in research and innovation. In 2020 they will also indicate to which extent they strengthen and/or complement national frameworks. The proposal should also explain previous steps taken by the organisation regarding gender equality.
The proposal will provide proof of long term commitment in the implementation of GEPs from their highest management level. The role of middle management and relevant departments of the partner organisations in the implementation of the GEPs should be described.
The proposals will include a methodology for impartially evaluating the progress made on the impact the gender equality plans had on structural change throughout the duration of the project. A specific work package(s) and deliverable(s) should be introduced in the proposal for this purpose.
Special emphasis will be placed on the sustainability of the GEPs to be implemented and on project follow-up initiatives.
In 2020 a further focus will be on impact at national level. It is therefore recommended the participation of national authorities as part of the projects' advisory structures.
The allocation of resources within the consortium will focus on the implementation of GEPs in the partner organisations. These partner organisations must be at a starting/initial stage in the setting-up and implementation of gender equality plans. Proposals should allocate the majority of funding to setting-up and implementing GEPS. The proposal will explain the role of partners not implementing GEPs and their specific contribution in line with the text and requirements of the topic.
Participation of professional associations in the consortium is recommended.
In 2020 other actors such as scientific publishers should also be considered, Furthermore special attention should be given to GEP-implementing organisations from countries for which the implementation of ERA Priority 4 (gender equality and gender mainstreaming in research) has shown slower progress as shown in the ERA Progress Report 2018.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU between EUR 2.50 million and 3.00 million and a duration of 48 months would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts or duration.
Expected Impact:
The proposed action will contribute to increasing the number of research organisations and higher education establishments implementing gender equality plans. The individual implemented GEPs should be shared on the GEAR tool[4].
The expected impacts are:
Increase in the participation of women in research and innovation and improvement of their careers prospects;
Improvement of gender balance in decision-making bodies in research organisations;
Inclusion, where relevant, of the gender dimension in research content and increase in the quality and societal relevance of produced knowledge, technologies and innovations.
In the medium to long term, the implementation of Gender Equality Plans will contribute to the achievement of the ERA.

","Research and Innovation action
","12 April 2017
","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
The challenge is to operationalise an Open Science rationale for one or more of the societal challenges defined under Horizon 2020. This should be done by a knowledge coalition based on a quadruple helix model of innovation in which civil society organisations, industry, government and academia are committed to work together and share knowledge and data among each other and interested third parties, thus putting Open Science in action in order to produce Responsible Research and Innovation solutions for a particular societal challenge. As citizens and civil society organisations are becoming increasingly involved in research and innovation projects and processes, an input by Citizen Scientists can be considered for the present specific challenge.
Scope:
Proposals can be inspired (but not exclusively) by previous Mobilisations and Mutual Learning Action Plans (MMLs) funded by the European Commission, in their methods or actual design and outcomes. MMLs bringing together a wide diversity of actors to deliberate and share on matters of science, technology and innovation, they can ensure an evidence-based, both knowledge and value-driven approach in support of EU policies. The proposals should enable trans-disciplinary research and innovation cooperation.
Proposals will focus on one or more of the following challenges, at multiple geographical scales (global to local):
Health, demographic change and wellbeing;
Food security, sustainable agriculture and forestry, marine and maritime and inland water research, and the Bioeconomy;
Secure, clean and efficient energy (in line with the Commission priority for 2014-2019, Energy Union[1] );
Smart, green and integrated transport;
Climate action, environment, resource efficiency and raw materials;
Europe in a changing world - inclusive, innovative and reflective societies (in line with the Commission priorities for 2014-2019, 'Stronger Global Actor', 'a Union of Democratic Change' and a 'New Policy on Migration'[1]) including Social Science and Humanities and Big Data ;
Secure societies - protecting freedom and security of Europe and its citizens.
To be of real impact, proposals must ensure research and innovation solutions and their possibility can be increased by public-private partnerships whereby Citizen Science can also involved,
In line with the strategy for EU international cooperation in research and innovation (COM(2012)497), international cooperation is encouraged.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of the order of EUR 3 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
This action allows for the provision of financial support to third parties in line with the conditions set out in Part K of the General Annexes.
Expected Impact:
The knowledge coalitions and the adoption of a responsible research and innovation approach will facilitate the uptake of socially acceptable innovative solutions. The topic will provide an Open Science pilot which will become a reference for other scientific endeavours. It will demonstrate how Open Science and RRI can be used to foster effective science-policy-society interfaces to support research and innovation at various geographical levels, in Europe. It will foster socially responsible citizen science approaches embedding the concept of RRI. It will provide EU leadership in this emerging practice of science, within Europe and in a wider global context..

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Within the New Skills Agenda (adopted in June 2016)[1] and in the Modernisation Agenda (adopted in May 2017)[2] specifications on innovative employment-oriented curricula recommendations are described. The Open Science Agenda incorporates activities which makes it crucial for Higher Education Institutions including for European Universities to integrate new or existing Open Science and entrepreneurship skills courses into PhD programmes and to train data stewards for example. Especially the formal integration of skills courses developed with and by non-academic actors and provided in non-academic surroundings into curricula, will be a specific challenge.
Scope:
A broad package of Open Science and entrepreneurship skills-related training, integration and intelligence for researchers and scientists in all career stages should to be developed. In 2020, the focus should be on open science and open innovation practices and the training should be integrated into existing PhD programmes.
Projects need to be organised by (or in cooperation with) experienced projects, which already developed and implemented joint PhD curricula, for example under Erasmus+ or ITN. . In all cases, partners should be able to demonstrate proof of concept and initial impact of the PhD training and reasoning for improving and formally integrating skills training. Initial postgraduate tracking exercises have to be integrated in the proposal, to demonstrate ability to trace postgraduates during employment (including sex-disaggregated data). Counselling initiatives of PhD candidates and PhD graduates into focussed careers in and outside academia should be provided.
In 2019, the Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU between EUR 0.75 million and 1.00 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
In 2020, the Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU between EUR 0.20 million and 0.30 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
Impact is expected on post-graduate candidates and early stage researchers' careers, in closing the Open Science and entrepreneurship skills gap between research employment in academia and beyond academia. Expected impact also on the improvement of the innovation potential of future PhD candidates, by joint design of skills training courses and curricula of consortium partners into modernised PhD programmes. Expected impact on the joint collaboration between academia and stakeholders in the regions (hubs) by improving skills intelligence, skills visibility and comparability for better career choices; learning about future Open Science and entrepreneurship skills needs and employment potential of scientists in various (interdisciplinary/intersectoral) fields. Expected impact on the interdisciplinary and international mobility of researchers working under Open Science and entrepreneurship practices, also in line with the Innovative Doctoral Training Principles (IDTP).[3]

","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
RRI (RRI) is cutting across Horizon 2020. RRI is a package[1]aiming to better engage society across all Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation activities. Nevertheless it is not immediately clear what the issues are in the various parts of Horizon 2020 and how they can be best addressed. The definition or characterisation of RRI is rather too open and this creates difficulties to operationalize it directly in each of the parts of Horizon 2020. This has also to do with the fact that RRI works out differently in different domains and for different industrial and societal challenges.
Furthermore, eventual desirable outcomes of RRI depend just as much on what is happening overall, also in the Member States, than what can be done within the confines of Horizon 2020. Still, Horizon 2020 activities can play a leading role, through articulating an evidence-based diagnosis, storyline or narrative for each of its parts, and through taking up and further developing approaches and tools, including training tools.
.
Scope:
Applicants will select experts from different parts of Horizon 2020, project coordinators and participants as well as representatives of the main stakeholders with a view to engage together to compare experiences and identify opportunities to develop RRI in the various parts of Horizon 2020.
An RRI diagnosis will be developed for each of the parts of Horizon 2020, including substantial issues of science and technology developments, processes and institutions, as well as relevant societal aspects. Each part should try and formulate actions and activities to address items from the diagnosis (which might include work to improve the diagnosis). This will be articulated as a 'storyline' or a 'narrative' about overall present and future developments, which would then lead to identifying RRI aspects and activities specific to the different Horizon 2020 parts.
The work on the diagnoses, for each part of Horizon 2020, should lead to suggestions for further work, including RRI work (activities and studies). It will also be an occasion to adapt training tools as available today (e.g. RRI-TOOLS[2], FOSTER[3], not excluding others) to the specific situation of each part of Horizon 2020, so as to be more effective in reaching and supporting stakeholders. These training tools will be tested in the specific scientific and societal fields considered. They will be practical, engaging, and outcome-oriented. The online didactic material and training toolkits will be made available free of charge/open access for re-use linked with existing online material.
Sophisticated public engagement, including co-creation, will be one important set of tools for the present topic. It can also be interesting to explore the notion of ‘society-readiness level’, just as there is use of a notion of 'technology-readiness level' (TRL). The actual practices of using TRL can be somewhat limited, considering that TRLs are eventually always socio-technical, i.e. include economic and social (and sometimes political) readiness.
Good embedding practices can be drawn from the Horizon 2020 work programmes 2014-15 as well as from other similar public funding programmes at any governance level (i.e. international, national, regional or local levels) in Europe and beyond. Integration of the global dimension will be a must.
To address this specific challenge, proposals should have a wide geographical coverage. It is therefore expected that consortia would include at least entities from 10 different Member States or Associated Countries, although smaller consortia will also be eligible and may be selected.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of the order of EUR 6.8 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
This action allows for the provision of financial support to third parties in line with the conditions set out in Part K of the General Annexes.
Expected Impact:
'Storylines' or 'narratives' developed in relation to the various parts of Horizon 2020 will allow RRI to be an integral part of a more coherent Work Programme in Horizon 2020. They will impact as well on the relevant stakeholder communities as well as in the European Research Area and beyond.

EURAXESS aims at helping researchers and entrepreneurs to advance their career in Europe and thus make research and innovation more attractive, both for researchers in Europe who are facing career decisions and for those who are currently outside Europe and might consider relocating to Europe to develop their careers. From mainly mobility support, the EURAXESS network shall become the reference tool also for career development of researchers in public or private institutions.
Scope:
The objective of the action is to further intensify the services provided by the EURAXESS Service Centres by expanding their mandate of taking care of the early career development of researchers and entrepreneurs in Europe with particular focus on female Higher Education Institution students and researchers. The services of the EURAXESS network will reach out to mobile and non-mobile researchers and entrepreneurs with the aim of contributing to European policy developments in this area on opening new career trajectories in industry, thus including start-ups. This action will support activities of the EURAXESS Service Network represented by Bridgehead Organisations to address strategic issues related to support services of the network. The further diversification of career development and/or support for dual careers centres will be expanded over a wider geographical range of the network, support to researchers and young entrepreneurs for start-ups in SMEs and industry and concepts for better integration of researchers into the culture of the host country and to the culture of a business environment, as well as mentoring programmes for researchers.
Other services for researchers will be proposed: for instance, national EURAXESS websites will provide information on start-up schemes and skills for researchers in the respective country and relate to policy information as provided on the European EURAXESS portal about EU research policies for researchers and EU schemes developing more career opportunities. This includes issues related to a Global and a European Research Area and Responsible Research and Innovation. Activities such as the deepening of existing services through trainings, seminars, networking and updating of national EURAXESS portals will also be part of this action.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of the order of EUR 3.00 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
Better take up of career development guidance and the collaboration with start-ups and SME will open new career options for researchers and accelerate knowledge transfer to industry and fast take up of research results.
Increased job and funding opportunities on the EURAXESS Jobs portal and personalised assistance to researchers will accelerate the career development of young researchers, in particular female researchers. In the medium term, the action will produce efficiency gains and reduce transaction costs by creating a better match of existing talent and R&I needs and capacity in European research institutions and businesses. It will contribute directly to the Horizon 2020 objective of cross-national and international circulation of researchers; it will increase the number of researchers who have access to research infrastructures through Union support and the number of excellent researchers overall. It will contribute to meeting ERA objectives on gender equality. Over time, the action will contribute directly towards European targets on R&DI intensity and percentage of researchers in the active population, and to boost European research and innovation competitiveness.
By increasing the service level of the whole EURAXESS Services Network, the benefit for the research community will be long-lasting and far-reaching.

Gender equality strategy in research and innovation policy is given a growing attention at the level research performing organizations, including universities and funding organisations, in particular through institutional change and with the objectives of:
Removing barriers to the recruitment, retention and career progression of female researchers;
Addressing gender imbalances in decision making processes;
Strengthening the gender dimension in research programmes.
These objectives are pursued at EU level in Horizon 2020 and at national level in the European Research Area, with the support to Gender Equality Plans and to research on gender (e.g. gender studies, gender medicine, gender in transport). Implementing these policy objectives entails the involvement and development of gender-in-science infrastructures, centres or departments. They need to learn from each other and work together to share best practice and knowledge. There is a need of exchange and cooperation between experienced and less experienced centres / stakeholders from which all should gain and progress on the gender equality objectives.
Scope:
The funded action will create a community of practice of research and practitioners centres experienced in gender equality in research and innovation policies aim at:
sharing lessons learned from institutional change projects and from institutions with higher expertise and transformation experiences
developing tools to share their lessons learned and stimulate activities in less advanced institutions
sharing experience with and mentoring institutions who want to implement structural change and advance on gender knowledge
providing information and training about gender in academic careers and setting gender equality plans, thereby encouraging less advanced organisations to engage in institutional change
creating and facilitating a forum in which experienced and less experienced stakeholders meet and share their experiences
The proposals shall undertake an assessment of the needs of the less advanced institutions or countries.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of the order of 3 million EUR would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
This action allows for the provision of financial support to third parties in line with the conditions set out in Part K of the General Annexes.
Expected Impact:
Improved inter- centre and transnational learning on knowledge and practices on gender equality in research and innovation; increased gender expertise across Europe; ,increased engagement across Europe for institutional change to promote gender equality.
The activities will contribute to increase the number of research organisations implementing gender equality plans to the achievement of the ERA.

Within the New Skills Agenda (adopted in June 2016)[1] and in the Modernisation Agenda (adopted in May 2017)[2] specifications on innovative employment-oriented curricula recommendations are described. The Open Science Agenda incorporates activities which makes it crucial for Higher Education Institutions including for European Universities to integrate new or existing Open Science and entrepreneurship skills courses into PhD programmes and to train data stewards for example. Especially the formal integration of skills courses developed with and by non-academic actors and provided in non-academic surroundings into curricula, will be a specific challenge.
Scope:
A broad package of Open Science and entrepreneurship skills-related training, integration and intelligence for researchers and scientists in all career stages should to be developed. In 2020, the focus should be on open science and open innovation practices and the training should be integrated into existing PhD programmes.
Projects need to be organised by (or in cooperation with) experienced projects, which already developed and implemented joint PhD curricula, for example under Erasmus+ or ITN. . In all cases, partners should be able to demonstrate proof of concept and initial impact of the PhD training and reasoning for improving and formally integrating skills training. Initial postgraduate tracking exercises have to be integrated in the proposal, to demonstrate ability to trace postgraduates during employment (including sex-disaggregated data). Counselling initiatives of PhD candidates and PhD graduates into focussed careers in and outside academia should be provided.
In 2019, the Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU between EUR 0.75 million and 1.00 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
In 2020, the Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU between EUR 0.20 million and 0.30 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
Impact is expected on post-graduate candidates and early stage researchers' careers, in closing the Open Science and entrepreneurship skills gap between research employment in academia and beyond academia. Expected impact also on the improvement of the innovation potential of future PhD candidates, by joint design of skills training courses and curricula of consortium partners into modernised PhD programmes. Expected impact on the joint collaboration between academia and stakeholders in the regions (hubs) by improving skills intelligence, skills visibility and comparability for better career choices; learning about future Open Science and entrepreneurship skills needs and employment potential of scientists in various (interdisciplinary/intersectoral) fields. Expected impact on the interdisciplinary and international mobility of researchers working under Open Science and entrepreneurship practices, also in line with the Innovative Doctoral Training Principles (IDTP).[3]

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Gender equality is a key priority set with the Member States and Associated countries in the European Research Area. Research funding and performing organisations, including universities, are invited to implement institutional change through Gender Equality Plans (GEPs). The Council conclusions of 1 December 2015[1] acknowledged the contribution of gender equality to the quality of research and innovation. It reaffirmed the need for sustainable cultural and institutional change along the three following objectives:
Removing barriers to the recruitment, retention and career progression of women researchers;
Addressing gender imbalances in decision making processes;
Integrating the gender dimension in research and innovation content[2].
The GEAR tool developed by the European Commission and EIGE[3] regrouped the state of the art knowledge and practices on institutional change and provided a step-by-step guide on how to set up and implement GEPs.
Scope:
The action should focus on implementing Gender Equality Plans (GEPs) in research funding organisations and research performing organisations including universities, as ""drivers"" for systemic institutional changes. The GEPs should be developed using a coherent approach, referring to the GEAR tool step-by-step guide. The proposed GEPs structure will include at least the following:
Conduct assessment / audit of procedures and practices with relevant data to identify gender bias at organisation level;
Implement effective actions to be developed over time, according to the identified bias;
Set targets and monitor progress via indicators at organisation level.
The proposals will explain the planned GEPs in the context of existing national provisions and national action plans and strategies (legislation, specific incentives, etc.) relating to gender equality in research and innovation. In 2020 they will also indicate to which extent they strengthen and/or complement national frameworks. The proposal should also explain previous steps taken by the organisation regarding gender equality.
The proposal will provide proof of long term commitment in the implementation of GEPs from their highest management level. The role of middle management and relevant departments of the partner organisations in the implementation of the GEPs should be described.
The proposals will include a methodology for impartially evaluating the progress made on the impact the gender equality plans had on structural change throughout the duration of the project. A specific work package(s) and deliverable(s) should be introduced in the proposal for this purpose.
Special emphasis will be placed on the sustainability of the GEPs to be implemented and on project follow-up initiatives.
In 2020 a further focus will be on impact at national level. It is therefore recommended the participation of national authorities as part of the projects' advisory structures.
The allocation of resources within the consortium will focus on the implementation of GEPs in the partner organisations. These partner organisations must be at a starting/initial stage in the setting-up and implementation of gender equality plans. Proposals should allocate the majority of funding to setting-up and implementing GEPS. The proposal will explain the role of partners not implementing GEPs and their specific contribution in line with the text and requirements of the topic.
Participation of professional associations in the consortium is recommended.
In 2020 other actors such as scientific publishers should also be considered, Furthermore special attention should be given to GEP-implementing organisations from countries for which the implementation of ERA Priority 4 (gender equality and gender mainstreaming in research) has shown slower progress as shown in the ERA Progress Report 2018.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU between EUR 2.50 million and 3.00 million and a duration of 48 months would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts or duration.
Expected Impact:
The proposed action will contribute to increasing the number of research organisations and higher education establishments implementing gender equality plans. The individual implemented GEPs should be shared on the GEAR tool[4].
The expected impacts are:
Increase in the participation of women in research and innovation and improvement of their careers prospects;
Improvement of gender balance in decision-making bodies in research organisations;
Inclusion, where relevant, of the gender dimension in research content and increase in the quality and societal relevance of produced knowledge, technologies and innovations.
In the medium to long term, the implementation of Gender Equality Plans will contribute to the achievement of the ERA.

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
There is increasing interest, and occasional experiments in processes of co-construction (e.g. agenda-building and policy inputs, co-evaluation, co-funding) and co-production (e.g. citizen science). Sometimes, it is deemed sufficient to have such processes occur, but one could also consider their content and how society would be integrated through approaches like value-sensitive design and gender-sensitive design. There are also combinations of process and content, as with place-based activities involving smart cities, living labs, and the regional dimension linked to Smart Specialization Strategies. For the gender dimension, research has already been funded to outline the loss to society and economy of not taking gender aspects into account in research organization and research design. Such questions can be raised for other dimensions of RRI as well.
While traditional approaches to public engagement will remain, this topic constitutes an opening towards the ‘new wave’ of public engagement where ‘co-creation’ is a key notion. It will provide innovative solutions to the more heavily technology and/or systems oriented approaches in other parts of Horizon2020.
Approaches and openings to the “creation of spaces for public engagement” (Rome Declaration), including the development and use of temporary and permanent physical spaces (e.g. exhibitions, events), will contribute towards the processes of involving European citizens and the co-creation of knowledge
Scope:
The topic could become an umbrella for all sorts of projects, allowing benchmarking and comparisons.
An important focus for study in this topic is the question of what outcomes are being realised. Co-construction and society sensitive design are well intentioned, but what happens will be refracted through practicalities embedded in existing institutions and interests. This has been documented extensively for ICT. There is a structural element here, in the sense that co-construction and design necessarily take place at an early stage, while there are many other factors and circumstances at play in the later stages which co-determine outcomes.
There is a similar structural problem with regulation: good intentions, but actual implementation on the ground falls short. There have been calls for ‘implementable regulation’, where one would start with what are achievable effects in practice, rather than good intentions.
The present topic, on possible outcomes of integration of society in science, shall include the aspect of ‘implementable integration’. This requires study of dynamics of such initiatives, and will definitely improve their reflexivity.
The topic can also consider the role of science communication in improving the quality and effectiveness of the interactions between stakeholders.
To address this specific challenge, proposals should have a wide geographical coverage. It is therefore expected that consortia would include at least entities from 10 different Member States or Associated Countries, although smaller consortia will also be eligible and may be selected.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of the order of EUR 4 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
This action allows for the provision of financial support to third parties in line with the conditions set out in Part K of the General Annexes.
Expected Impact:
This action aims at developing a better understanding of co-creation processes and outcomes under various cultural, societal and regulatory backgrounds. It will allow better-targeted policy support in the future.

Gender equality is not only a matter of social justice but also of research performance. Indeed, including a sex and gender analysis enhances the research quality and the societal relevance of the produced knowledge, technologies and innovations. It is therefore recommended that researchers across Europe and beyond acquire adequate knowledge on gender equality and the gender dimension[1], in general and in their specific fields of research. Universities with gender studies departments are still a minority, and those including gender issues in the curricula of other disciplines are even fewer,[2] limiting the sharing of existing knowledge. The Horizon 2020 interim evaluation recommends further sharing and disseminating knowledge on gender in R&I.
Scope:
In an initial phase, this project will design training material for trainers, practitioners and researchers on a variety of issues relevant for gender equality in research and innovation (gender balance, gender dimension, gender bias, etc.). The project should clarify the minimum quality standard of the training material. It should draw knowledge from the GEAR Tool and the Gendered Innovations report, as well as on new knowledge, developed in Horizon 2020, across and beyond Europe.
In a second phase, the project will carry out a series of trainings, such as Moocs[3], workshops, summer schools, modules, webinars accessible in all the Member States and Associated countries. The project shall target trainers and researchers, in particular in the early stage of their careers with tailored-made activities. The activities shall be designed in a way that they attract men as well as women. A pan-European network of trainers will be established, with the aim of enhancing the sharing of knowledge and practices.
To address this specific challenge, proposals may benefit from a broad coverage. It is therefore suggested that consortia could include at least entities from 10 different Member States or Associated Countries.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of the order of EUR 2.00 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
A better understanding of gender issues within the R&I community. A better uptake of gender issues in R&I and consequently an improvement of the quality of the produced research and innovation. A pan-European trainers' network to better share gender knowledge and practices.

At the moment, 'a linked-up global world of RRI', is a future, and speculative, perspective. But the world is definitely linked-up, and there is recurrent mention of, and occasional work on, RRI-type issues all over the world. In the field of nanotechnology, for some time (since the early 2000s) there were platforms and spaces for dialogue. What is the role of regulation and of civil society in a linked-up global society? What is the role of industry, with the dynamics of firms wanting to appear as 'good firms' rather than the contrary? Similarly, what is the role of nation states and international organizations in this global world?
One might actually consider that RRI could become a competitive advantage, definitely for Europe and directly contribute to Europe’s jobs and growth agenda. That possibility will be one element of this topic. It is important to give industry’s ‘ethical behaviour’ a concrete foothold, and not to leave it to abstract deliberations. To this end, domain and case studies in key areas, such as Digital Single Market and Energy Union, supporting the Commission’s agenda[1] for jobs, growth, fairness and democratic change will be relevant. Other sectors of activities can be considered as case studies as well (e.g. bio-economy, waste management) provided that they yield significant insight into the possible rise of the global world of RRI.
Scope:
There are interesting projects already that can be built on for the present topic. The EU-funded ProGReSS project[2], aims to promote a European approach to Responsible Research and Innovation (RRI) through a global network, including partners and advisers from Europe, the US, China, Japan, India, Australia and South Africa, and involvement of relevant stakeholders from academia, international organisations, industry, SME research, NGOs, policy advisors and research funders. The GEST (Global Ethics in Science and Technology) project[2], which has recently led to a major publication on Science and Technology Governance and Ethics, comparing Europe, China and India, is another example.
The present topic spans at least over three overlapping foci:
Identification and analysis of platforms and spaces for RRI-type issues
Comparative studies of major and minor players, taking into account differences especially the situation of developing countries
Advantages (up to competitiveness) of RRI, and ethical behaviour in general.
It is also important to locate these questions and trends in current and emerging governance frameworks.
In line with the strategy for EU international cooperation in research and innovation (COM(2012)497), international cooperation is encouraged, including with third countries beyond Associated Countries.
To address this specific challenge, proposals should have a wide geographical coverage. It is therefore expected that consortia would include at least entities from 10 different Member States or Associated Countries, although smaller consortia will also be eligible and may be selected.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of the order of EUR 3 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
This action allows for the provision of financial support to third parties in line with the conditions set out in Part K of the General Annexes.
Expected Impact:
Better understanding of the dynamics of a 'linked-up global world of RRI' will allow benchmarking European RRI initiatives and integrating good practices from other contexts. It will help industry, civil society and policy makers to take decisions based on evidence. It will produce formal knowledge, easing the dissemination of good practices and improving existing training material.

The Responsible Research and Innovation (RRI) approach supported by the European Commission since 2011 aims to encourage societal actors to work together during the whole research and innovation (R&I) process to better align R&I and its outcomes with the values, needs and expectations of society. Experience shows that strategies and practices based on RRI can open up R&I to all relevant actors, and improve co-operation between science and society, fostering the recruitment of new talent, and pairing scientific excellence with social awareness and responsibility.
Territories have a specific advantage to address the complexity of the challenges set by the interplay between science and society. Indeed local actors have an intimate knowledge of the physical territorial setting, and local ecology, i.e. the status quo of the complex relationships between cultural, social, economic and political actors, of the local dynamics, history, expectations and requirements as well as specific concerns.
During the last century, local and regional development policies have slowly, unevenly, but surely, integrated dimensions related to science, technology, and innovation (STI). For example, the European Commission supported regional technology plans in the 1990s and regional innovation strategies during the 2000s. Since 2010 the Commission has encouraged regions to develop smart specialisation strategies, based on comprehensive stakeholder involvement, to identify specific fields of industrial and research strengths with a potential for competitive advantages for the region[1]. A more comprehensive approach involving citizens and communities is likely to result in positive impacts on STI and local and regional development.
Territories can work towards the establishment of self-sustaining R&I ecosystems that are characterised by a high degree of openness, democratic accountability, and responsiveness to need by taking action to promote all parts of RRI (i.e. gender equality, science education, open access/open data, public engagement, and ethics). This requires them to bring relevant quadruple helix R&I actors together, for instance citizens and civil society organisations (CSOs), universities, research institutions, formal and informal education institutions (including primary and secondary schools), governments and public authorities (including regional and local administrations and science policy institutions), businesses (including industry, the service sector and social entrepreneurs) and science mediators. New R&I working methods within and between organisations, including novel and transparent governance relations, would promote greater sustainability and inclusiveness at local, national, EU and global levels.
Scope:
For the present topic, 'territory' should be understood broadly. Territories may be defined by any particular area characterised by certain geographical features, or any area with shared cultural, environmental or economic ties.
Consortia should focus activities in more than one territory in Europe (and possibly also in Third Countries), with a view to developing and promoting shared learning and diffusion of governance innovations. Local and regional authorities should be active partners of the consortia, in particular those institutions or parts of institutions responsible for research and innovation, alongside organisations representing the other parts of the quadruple helix. The RRI approach should be integrated in regional development policies, e.g. spatial planning, land use planning, coastal planning, urban development and urban structuring activities (list not exhaustive). Consortia should make strong efforts to ensure the involvement of all kind of citizens, irrespective of their age, gender, ethnicity and socio-economic background. Involvement of citizens must be in line with Article 21 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union.
Consortia should lay out a sequence of actions that open up and transform the R&I ecosystem and governance systems so that they are more open and inclusive.
Consortia will:
- Map their current territorial R&I ecosystem, taking into account and complementing existing mapping exercises such as the Smart Specialisation Platform[2], the European Cluster Observatory, and the Regional Innovation Scoreboard[3],
- Reflect on how the system could be more open and inclusive, and
- Consider their place within larger societal, geographical, economic and environmental framework.
- Consequently, proposals should develop concrete actions within individual beneficiaries' organisations (e.g. agenda setting and institutional changes in the fields of gender, ethics, public engagement, science education and open access) and in the territorial context (e.g. local and regional governance relations and decision-making processes).
Changes should be sustainable (i.e. last beyond the lifetime of funding), for instance through the introduction of new forms of decision-making, development of business plans or co-operation agreements, and institutional changes in participating organisations.
The actions should avoid duplicating the analytical and data collection activities of the Smart Specialisation Platform. Previous project findings and good practices should be considered as and when appropriate. Previous project findings and good practices should be considered as and when appropriate; projects such as TeRRIFICA[4], TeRRItoria, SeeRRI[5], ONLINE-S3[6] and SEiSMIC[7] could be useful in this regard. The ONLINE-S3 project aims to assist national and regional authorities in the EU to elaborate and revise their smart specialisation agendas, in terms of policies and strategy, whereas the SEiSMiC project helps tackle Europe's biggest urban problems by engaging citizens, identifying social innovation needs, and contributing to future urban policies and research strategies.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of the order of € 2.00 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
Consortia are expected to elaborate and implement a more open, transparent and democratic R&I system in their defined territories. Consortia are expected to evaluate their activities and provide evidence of societal, democratic, environmental, economic and scientific impacts. Involvement in the project should have a measurable transformative and opening effect on organisations involved, which should be sustainable beyond the lifetime of funding. Consortia are expected to contribute to one or more of the MoRRI indicators (for instance GE1, SLSE1, SLSE4, PE1, PE2, PE5, PE7, PE8, E1, OA6, GOV2)[8], and to the Sustainable Development Goals[9] (for instance goals 4, 5, 9, 11, 12, 13, 16 or 17).

","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Innovation, from idea to product, and including social innovation[1], is a main driver for change, a pillar of EU growth and globally for socio-economic development. It addresses key challenges in fields such as the environment and health and improving the quality of life and well-being of citizens.
Over the past years, the modes of interaction between the different stakeholders have evolved significantly. Active participation of citizens in science and innovation has gained prominence. At the same time, new IT tools have profoundly impacted the way in which researchers work and interact. These developments are promising and have numerous advantages. At the same time, however, these new modes of innovation also raise ethical and regulatory considerations, including concerns regarding the protection of participating citizens, their potential exploitation, the collection of big data and related privacy considerations, as well as intellectual property issues.
Scope:
In order to maximise the social benefits derived from innovation, the action will assess the ethical, regulatory and governance issues potentially arising in this context. The action should identify what the distinctive elements of innovation ethics would be in this dynamic context.
The role of citizen participation in innovation (including social innovation[2]) must be analysed in order to maximise the effectiveness of this participation for all stakeholders, taking into account possible gender differences. Best practices for an active involvement of citizens and relevant stakeholders in the innovation processes should be identified. The design and use of IT tools should also be considered in order to optimise stakeholder participation.
In addition, the existing legal environment applicable to citizen participation in research and innovation should be identified, mapped and analysed. Potential regulatory and legal gaps (concerning for example IP rights and ownership of data) should be described and concrete proposals should be presented to address the highlighted gaps.
The analytical work should not be limited to the legal aspects, but also cover current practices (in the EU and beyond) with a view to discussing their ethics and values dimensions and taking into account the lessons learned so as to be able to identify best practices. In doing so, business ethics practices should also be considered.
The action must propose an ethics framework, based on accepted principles[3], which aim to ensure that innovation remains a process which responds to citizens' needs and values, improves access and avoids a technological divide. Such a framework should focus on the elaboration and implementation of publicly funded research and innovation programmes, as well as public–private partnerships. It should be developed, validated and translated into a set of practical guidelines that enable the effective handling of the identified ethical and regulatory issues.
Such a framework and guidelines must be compatible with and aim to complement the new European code of conduct for research integrity[4] and include, where applicable, measures for benefit sharing. This process necessitates the active involvement of relevant stakeholders to ensure an effective take-up. The effectiveness of the guidelines should be assessed and tested, notably via workshops and focus groups (such science cafes, etc.) involving citizens, industry, researchers and policy makers. In addition, the resulting guidelines should be applied in real-life pilots with quantifiable results. Piloting needs to be carried out in a representative set of Member States in order to test different cultural/socio-political context.
The action should involve innovation agencies and/or research and innovation funding organisations, which are called to apply the results of the project into their internal procedures.
In line with the strategy for EU international cooperation in research and innovation (COM(2012)497), international cooperation is encouraged.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of the order of EUR 3.00 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
Overall, this action will enable more effective handling of the ethical dimension of innovation, in particular regarding the new modes of interaction and participation. It will offer a practical and operative tool for all stakeholders confronted with the challenges related to co-design[5] and to new (IT-based) interaction modes. It will practically support the work of a) the designers and funders of research and innovation policies/programmes, b) the ethics committees tasked with evaluating and monitoring innovative programmes and projects, and c) the research integrity bodies responsible for promoting research integrity and research quality. The implementation of the guidelines in pilots are expected to increase their uptake and overall the impact of the action.

","Coordination and support action
","13 April 2016
","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
The exponential development of knowledge resulting from biomedical research challenges the ethics of informed consent. Patients, practitioners, researchers, health authorities and other stakeholders are confronted with the difficulty to reconcile their legal and administrative environment, biomedical ethics, Human Rights and the increasing global availability of new effective treatments. For some worldwide high mortality diseases, this includes an important gender dimension. In addition to the ethical and social aspects, the economic dimension and potential impact of this challenge on EU health budgets is very significant.
Scope:
Although informed consent is the pillar of ethics in medical research, several cases with high public coverage have awakened society on the difficulty to simultaneously optimise the research objectives and the patients' wellbeing while limiting the various types of potential conflicts of interest. The proposed action shall study this complex and multidimensional ethics dilemma. The focus shall be on the involvement of patients in translational research and in clinical research based on existing and validated treatments. Similar type of clinical ethics challenges exists when physicians advise patients and have to handle financial aspects, notably the fact that some available effective treatments or tests are reimbursed or not (depending on the countries).
In this context, it is necessary to build up a set of guidelines helping the clinicians to find practical answers enabling the full respect of clinical ethics, in particular ensuring an actual informed consent for these patients involved or not in clinical studies. In order to be effective, the guidelines shall be elaborated with the active involvement of the different actors of the chain, from the clinical researchers/health practitioners and their institution to the health public authorities and the other actors of the health systems: the pharmaceutical industry, the patient groups etc. In order to increase the direct impact of the work, the general guidelines shall be applied to a minimum of two specific cases where the global availability of new treatments, tests/diagnosis tools challenge the clinical practice leading to different form of disparities. This shall include the additional complexity of the gender perspective and therefore be performed on at least one gender specific disease (e.g. breast/ovarian cancer).
The proposed action shall also analyse the use of social media and ICT technologies to facilitate the information supply and the interaction between the patients and the clinicians, particularly in cases where the optimal treatments become possible faster than through the institutional changes (public health measures) that make them available to society. The involvement of all relevant stakeholders is necessary for this step, including innovative industries and patients associations.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of the order of EUR 3.8 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
This action allows for the provision of financial support to third parties in line with the conditions set out in Part K of the General Annexes.
Expected Impact:
Taking into account the gender dimension, will increase the EU standards of clinical research ethics, in particular the quality of informed consent by developing practical guidelines supporting the work of clinicians while stimulating innovation and increase the use of effective new treatments.

Some technologies raise complex ethical issues that can have considerable socio-economic impact and generate lively debates on research ethics and Human Rights. The areas of genomics human enhancement and man-machine interactions are of particular importance due to their innovative nature and potential impact on jobs and growth. Although repairing an injured body is an accepted and welcome practice, genomics applications and a number of body and mental enhancements as well as the changing nature of the relationship between humans and machines (i.e. robots) raise complex ethical issues that need to be addressed at EU level. In order to promote an inclusive and sustainable socio-economic model, there is a pressing need to provide ethical responses and practical options which support innovation, the research community, facilitates the work of ethics committees and addresses the expectations of society.
Scope:
While the work shall integrate the broad ethical perspectives of the emerging technologies, especially those with potentially high social and economic impact, the focus shall be on (a) genomics, in particular genetic testing and screening, genetic patents, genetic databanks and pharmacogenomics and (b) human enhancement, including a categorisation of human enhancement practices on the basis of social, medical and technical criteria and (c) human-machine interactions including the creation of intelligent environments. All the concerned technologies raise several interrelated ethical issues for which there is not yet a clear and stable framework at EU and international level.
A comparison, within the EU and with other regions of the world on both the legal framework (existing or under development) and the level of societal awareness and acceptance constitute therefore an important element of the work. Such an analysis shall integrate the role of ethics committees and other advisory and regulatory structures and examine the impact of these technologies while proving the necessary elements to support the research community in integrating the ethics dimension in their research protocols.
Building on and completing existing practices, the work undertaken shall result, for each of the three topics, with operational guidelines for research ethics committees as well as proposing a code of responsible conduct for researchers, taking into account the expectations of the different stakeholders. This shall be achieved by involving actively civil society organizations and panels of citizens from different socio-economic groups including vulnerable populations. As a result the possible enhancement of the existing ethical and legal frameworks shall be proposed while considering the rapid scientific evolution of the emerging fields.
The possibility to generalise the analysis to other new or emerging technologies shall be studied since a number of the conclusions that will be drawn could serve in other technological and research context raising similar ethical issues.
In line with the strategy for EU international cooperation in research and innovation (COM(2012)497), international cooperation is encouraged.
Publicly available results from relevant EU funded research projects (mainly from FP7) should be taken into account.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of the order of EUR 3.8 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.

Expected Impact:
The proposed action will contribute to the development and practical implementation of high ethics standards at EU and international level addressing the growing challenges and expectations vis-à-vis these technologies. The work undertaken will also offer concrete ways of better reconciling the needs of the research teams and the legitimate concerns of the citizens while stimulating innovation and contributing to the reduction of socio-economic inequalities including in health treatment and social status. Overall, it will contribute to the development of new approaches in addressing ethical issues of new and emerging technologies and promoting responsible conduct of research while enhancing the innovative nature and potential socioeconomic impact of these technologies.

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Institutional changes are required to respond to the increased interactions between R&I stakeholders in society. Through institutional changes, research funding and performing organisations become more “porous” and accept inputs from citizens and organisations that used to be considered outsiders to the world of R&I. Examples include citizen science, extended peer review in funding agencies, co-creation of public policies, agenda setting in research and innovation programmes, co-production of research and innovation content, co-design of R&I programmes, and co-evaluation of proposals, activities or other R&I funding decisions.
Good practices are widespread in Europe in terms of citizens' and citizens' associations engagement in science; formal, informal and non-formal science education”; gender equality in science; Research ethics and integrity; Open access to research results including data.
The good practices in these five fields are much more easily, efficiently and sustainably implemented when the organisations funding, performing or associated to R&I have adapted significantly their governance frameworks to open up through a process of institutional change.
Scope:
Consortia are expected to implement institutional changes to promote citizens’ and their associations’ engagement in science, and possibly through an integrated approach covering some or all five fields. All scientific disciplines are covered. Consortia members should aim to ensure that the institutional changes are sustainable beyond the lifetime of the project funding. Consortia are expected to evaluate their activities and provide evidence of societal, democratic, economic and scientific impacts of institutional changes.
The action is addressed at organisations funding or performing activities in the field of R&I as one of their significant objectives or activities. All parts of the ""quadruple helix"" model, which sees close co-operation between industry, government, research (e.g. universities of applied sciences) and society (e.g. citizens and Civil Society Organisations) in R&I, are addressed – and it is encouraged that consortia ensure truly engaged roles for all organisation types. Consortia should be composed of organisations that already have some experience of processes of institutional change and beginners (i.e. organisations that have not worked before on implementing institutional changes for SWAFS), so as to encourage mutual learning. Moreover, proposals will be favoured that involve partners that have not worked together in SwafS before, so as to increase the reach and potential impact of the programme’s funding. Consortia should aim for broad geographical coverage (e.g. using the MoRRI study to involve partners from across different country clusters)[1].
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU in the order of €1.50 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
Results should contribute to a greater involvement of all stakeholders in R&I, a better and more sustainable engagement with citizens and society as a whole, and a more scientifically interested and literate society. Consortia are expected to contribute to one or more of the MoRRI indicators, in particular PE5, PE7, PE8, GOV2 & GOV3[2], and to the Sustainable Development Goals (for instance goals 4, 5, 9, 12, 16 or 17)[3] . The expected number of institutional changes, including their quality and sustainability, will be taken into account in evaluation. As such, it is expected that the topic will support a significant number of impactful and sustainable institutional changes in partner organisations.

The ICT centred research methodologies is changing the way research is organised, proposed and conducted. The untapped potential of Social media for example is fast becoming a new arena of research activities, also generating new challenges for the existing ethical and legal framework. Of paramount importance in this area is the balance between the use of ICT technologies to collect massive amounts of data (including personal data) and the principles of fundamental rights. As evidenced by the opinion of the European Group on ""Ethics of Security and Surveillance Technologies"", the actual and potential impact of ICT technologies on our daily life is high and rapidly growing. This raises multidimensional questions related to how to effectively implement the Charter of Fundamental Rights in our e-society while balancing the interest of all socio-economic stakeholders, promoting innovation, enabling high quality job creation and ensuring a high level of privacy and cyber security.
Scope:
The work undertaken shall analyse the existing and future possible ethical tensions between the technological evolution in the ICT field and the protection of human rights, in particular as regards privacy and personal data. Such analysis shall take into account the increasing number and unprecedented intensity of threats to public and private cyber security and the responses given by the competent international, European and national bodies.
The possibility to improve the regulatory framework at EU level in order to reduce the identified ethical tensions shall be reviewed. On the basis of an extensive dialogue with the concerned scientific, economic, security and political stakeholders and the involvement of civil society organisations, a set of ethical standards and guidelines for research and innovation activities should also be proposed. The practical operationalisation of the proposals made shall be examined taking into account the international economic and political dimension. The guidelines for research ethics committees and the research community shall facilitate the incorporation of the highest ethical standards into research protocols without jeopardising the innovative nature of the research and its potential socioeconomic impact. The above balance must be adequately analysed and measures to address it must be proposed.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of the order of EUR 2.8 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts
This action allows for the provision of financial support to third parties in line with the conditions set out in Part K of the General Annexes.
Expected Impact:
The action will actively contribute to the reduction of the ethical tensions existing between the potential of ICT technologies and the protection of human rights notably by elaborating operational standards and guidelines as well as suggesting possible concrete improvements of the current regulatory framework, in the spirit of the EU commitment to better regulation.

The EU currently has nine Outermost Regions (ORs), which are an integral part of its territory: Guadeloupe, French Guiana, Martinique, Saint Martin, Réunion, Mayotte (France); the Canary Islands (Spain); and the Azores and Madeira (Portugal). Article 349 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) recognises that the Outermost Regions differ from the rest of the EU in a number of ways that constrain their economic and social development: their remoteness, their insularity, their small size, their adverse topographical and climatic conditions and their dependence on a limited number of local industries. Under European law this Article allows the adoption of specific measures appropriate for the real situations of the ORs. As well as specific constraints, the ORs also have unique potential and assets which can benefit the Union. They provide a European presence in strategic areas of the world, and have exceptional geographical and geological characteristics which make them useful laboratories for research and innovation in scientific domains relevant of the future such as biodiversity, terrestrial and marine ecosystems, pharmacology, renewable energies, and the space sciences.
However, participation in Horizon 2020 is inhibited by the fragmentation of the research community in the OR due to the geographic isolation but also lack of commitment of research institutions and missing connectivity with excellent partners in Europe and internationally beyond the traditional links with the European mainland of the same country. Therefore, the potential for excellent research activities based on the above described assets remains largely unexploited. ORs of different countries face similar problems and assets but do not co-operate sufficiently among each other and with European and international partners. Geographical remoteness is an obstacle for visibility and integration into the global and international research communities. In particular improved linkages with neighbouring international co-operation partners outside the EU would facilitate the international dimension of Horizon 2020 in line with the 'Open to the World' strategic goal.
Scope:
Proposals should aim to support the OR in preparing their research and innovation actors to participate in the Research Framework Programmes through:
a mapping of their research and innovation fields of expertise including complementarities with their neighbouring countries' and regions expertise and capacities;
a mapping of potential partners in the EU and third countries, in particular those in proximity with OR;
an inventory of their needs to increase their research and innovation capacity;
an identification of the means to maintain and attract researchers in the OR and to foster the OR R&I ecosystems, as and further development of their smart specialisation strategies.
The above information could also be used to define OR's friendly topics in the future Framework Programme.
Proposals are also expected to include:
organisation of events with potential identified partners;
workshops and networking of research and business innovation partners in view of forming consortia for project proposals;
awareness raising actions targeting the EU and international research community on the OR expertise and capacities.
The Commission considers that a proven track record of on-the-field experience in OR R&I systems will be an asset and contribute positively to the impact of the project.
The duration of the project should be up to three years.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution up to EUR four million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately.
Expected Impact:
- Increasing the participation of the outermost regions (OR) in the Framework Programmes.
- Reinforce the visibility and recognition of the OR research and innovation expertise and capacities.
- Set up of consortia to prepare research proposals, including European and/or third country researchers.
- Facilitate the identification of future research issues and challenges/missions that are relevant for the needs and innovation potentials of OR and their smart specialisation priorities
- Develop concepts for considering ORs specificities in the future Framework Programme, in line with Article 349 TFEU.
- Strengthened links with European and international research centres.
- Improvement of research capacities in the OR and their participation in research projects.
- Emergence of sustainable R&I ecosystems in the OR.
- In order to ensure maximum impact of the initiative, participants are expected to build on their a proven track record of on-the-field experience in OR R&Is systems

","Research and Innovation action
","10 December 2019
","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
The objectives of the SwafS part of Horizon 2020 are to build effective co-operation between science and society, foster the recruitment of new talent for science, and to pair scientific excellence with social awareness and responsibility. There are eight lines of actions (science careers, gender equality, public engagement, science education, open access/open data, governance and ethics, the precautionary principle, science communication), all of which are pertinent to reaching the SwafS’ objectives.
The SwafS Work Programmes have included a range of topics that may be characterised as being relatively open (‘bottom-up’) or closed (‘prescriptive’), the choice of which has depended on the area of activity, the policy/research demands, and awareness of the need to open up space for creativity and good ideas to flow from applicants on transdisciplinary issues of concern. Even with this balance of open and closed topics, it is necessary to create space for ideas that fill gaps, ‘connect the dots’ between projects, activities and objectives, or focus on innovative or emerging issues that have so far not been broached.
Scope:
This topic is completely bottom-up (“open”), and therefore a challenge to applicants to propose innovative research and innovation actions that are needed to help meet SwafS objectives.
To respond this specific challenge, applicants could choose to consider: how societal actors, including young people, behave, understand, react to and interact with science and scientific developments, and their motives for engaging in science-related activities; how digital technologies can lead to new forms of science-based advocacy, and how science and technology studies and different disciplines (e.g. behavioural sciences, communication studies, gender studies, linguistics, and social anthropology) – and multi/transdisciplinary approaches – can help explain interactions between science and society; research and innovation gaps in relation to people's needs and concerns and in any of the areas or dimensions covered by RRI; RRI achievement rewards to highlight the organisations that are more RRI aware (answering questions such as how such a reward could work and based on which criteria);the implications of deep changes in science and innovation and their interactions with society and the economy, such as the transition to open science and open innovation, and resultant changes in the relationships between science and society.
Applicants should demonstrate that they aim to fill important gaps in the evidence base, how they will fill these gaps, and how they will deepen the evidence base. Scientific and other types of publication should be foreseen. Activities to involve stakeholders from all parts of the quadruple helix within the research and innovation activities will be favoured.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU between EUR 0.90 million and EUR 1.10 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
Consortia should choose a basket of indicators to measure the impact of their work. In particular, consortia are expected to contribute to one or more of the MoRRI indicators [1]. R&I outcomes should help build effective cooperation between science and society, foster the recruitment of new talent for science, and pair scientific excellence with social awareness and responsibility. Scientific and other types of publication should be foreseen.

Deadline date","Scope:
The Union Civil Protection Knowledge Network was established under the revised Union Civil Protection Mechanism (UCPM) legislation (Decision No 1313/2013/EU) as UCPM’s key tool for better flow of information, boosted innovation, improved knowledge, enhanced expertise and skills and consolidated scientific evidence through cooperation, exchange, partnership and networking.
The Knowledge Network’s vision is to strengthen the effectiveness and the efficiency of the collective civil protection and disaster management efforts in all phases of the disaster cycle of the UCPM. Its mission is to bring together civil protection and disaster management actors and institutions to improve the overall knowledge situation within the UCPM and foster the EU’s ability and capacity to deal with disasters.
The 2021 Call for Proposals on Knowledge Network Partnerships aims to directly contribute to the consolidation and operationalisation of the Union Civil Protection Knowledge Network through financing of projects that will directly support the development of key elements of the Knowledge Network’s governance structure.
Projects under the Call for Proposals will establish thematic communities/centres of expertise that will generate, promote, test, exchange and disseminate knowledge, skills, expertise, innovation and scientific evidence in support of the Capacity-Development and Science Pillars of the Knowledge Network.
The thematic communities/centres of expertise will be multinational and multidisciplinary specialised groups with organisational environments that strive for developing high standards of conduct in the fields of capacity-development, learning, research and innovation in civil protection and disaster risk management. The thematic communities will bring together individuals (practitioners, researchers and experts) from institutions (national and local civil protection authorities, research centres, policy institutes, centres of excellence etc.) engaged in disaster prevention, preparedness and response.
Thematic communities/centres of expertise will pull together, develop, disseminate and exchange state-of-the-art knowledge and expertise; encourage scientific excellence; stimulate technological innovation; gear educational and learning goals; and support policy and decision-making in civil protection and disaster management. To achieve this, thematic communities/centres of expertise will focus on a specific natural or human-induced hazard (earthquakes, forest/wildfires, floods, medical emergencies/pandemics, CBRN threats etc.), cluster of hazards (meteorological, geophysical, hydrological, climatological, technological etc.), or a particular preparedness and response scenario (emergency medical response, search and rescue operations etc.) Focus is placed on common risks and joint priorities identified by the UCPM Member States, Participating States and the EU.
Objectives:
Design, develop and implement multi-disciplinary, risk-based thematic communities/centres of expertise for civil protection and disaster management stakeholders.
Design, develop and implement capacity-development and applied science activities that contribute to building and sharing of knowledge, expertise and skills in civil protection and disaster management.
Expected impact:

Thematic communities/centres of expertise will be established and operate under the Knowledge Network, which will play a central role in providing the space, creating the rules of engagement and allowing stakeholders to own and lead their communities. Thematic communities/centres of expertise will serve both primary and secondary project beneficiaries, they will be integrated into the organisational and operational structure of the Knowledge Network and they will contribute to strengthening the UCPM’s decision-making, prevention, preparedness and response activities.
Once established, the thematic communities/centres of expertise should be able to link to each other and form a network of thematic communities/centres of expertise, whereby civil protection and disaster management actors come together and team up to exchange good practices, knowledge and expertise under more complex disaster and risk scenarios.
Using scenarios the thematic communities/centres of expertise will generate test and share knowledge at individual, organisational and systemic levels against critical common risks and emerging ones as well as facilitate the transfer of research, evidence-based practices and innovation outcomes into civil protection and disaster management planning and operations. Through the design, development and implementation of capacity-development and science activities, the thematic communities/centres of expertise will be able to convene and leverage a wide, multi-sectoral and multi-disciplinary basis of knowledge and expertise.
In addition, the thematic communities/centres of expertise will enable the engagement and involvement of civil protection and disaster management stakeholders with focus and expertise across various themes and disciplines to encourage the establishment of agile, sustainable and scalable partnerships."

Topic: Prevention and Preparedness for Cross-border Risks
Disasters know no borders. The risks posed by natural and man-made hazards are cross-border due to their spatial dimension (earthquakes, fires, severe weather, floods and space weather), as well as the volatility and scale of their impacts (pandemics, livestock epidemics, nuclear/industrial accidents). The human, economic and environmental impacts - including the impact on cultural heritage – triggered by these hazards, as well as their likelihood of occurrence exist irrespective of national borders. In fact, the EU can benefit from tackling cross-border risks beyond its borders, particularly in IPA beneficiaries and in the Southern and Eastern Neighbourhoods[1].
The increasing occurence and inter-dependence of new threats require a strong cross-sectoral and cross-border cooperation in prevention, preparedness and response.
Various EU legislative acts already call for a collaborative approach to disaster risk assessment and disaster management: for example, for flood risks or cross-border threats in the health sector. The revised UCPM legislation also aims at stepping up the collaboration at cross-border level and between Member States and Participating States prone to the same types of disasters.
While cross-border cooperation is relatively well-established in the area of emergency response, cross-border cooperation during the prevention and preparedness phases can be further enhanced. Notwithstanding, the response phase could also benefit from streamlined communication protocols and interoperable systems that overcome language barriers in emergency situations.
By focussing on countries that share a border, this Call for Proposals aims to foster a more sustained cooperation in cross-border regions.
This topic aims to enhance cross-border disaster risk management through prevention and preparedness in Europe, IPA beneficiaries and EU Neighbourhood countries.
Scope:
Applicants are invited to focus on one of the following call priorities (specific objectives):
Priority 1: Developing cross-border risk assessments
Without an assessment that takes into account cross-border risks, disaster risk management strategies will only partially address the risks a country faces. An analysis of national risk assessments submitted to the European Commission in 2018/2019 revealed that, while cross-sectoral interdependencies of risks are tackled to some extent in risk assessments, a cross-border (ie. regional/international) dimension is still mostly missing. A few good practices exist: the joint cross-border Benelux risk assessment, the Baltic Sea Region risk assessment or the Nordic Forum for Risk Analysis and Strategic Foresight.
Priority 2: Enhancing cross-border emergency management
The need for cross-border collaboration in disaster management arises when the response capacity of an affected region is surpassed and assistance from bordering communities is required.
Mutual understanding of civil protection and emergency management structures, work procedures and culture is essential for effective cross-border collaborations. Such cooperation can be of particular value when preparing for risks with a potential high impact but a low likelihood of occurrence (Hi-Lo risks). In these cases a joint preparation with neighbouring regions using one common planning instead of several separate plans is often more efficient.
Some regions have a long tradition of cross-border collaboration in disaster risk management and this has led to a structured exchange of knowledge and good practices over the years. This wealth of knowledge provides a solid base for cross-border collaboration that the UCPM can help disseminate and apply in other regions across Europe and its Neighbours.
Activities that can be funded
Under Priority 1, this Call for Proposals will co-finance activities that aim to assess/quantify risks with cross-border impacts, either building on/expanding existing cross-border risk assessments or developing one through the project. End-users will be civil protection authorities and stakeholders in Member States, Participating States, IPA beneficiaries not participating in the Mechanism, and/or European Neighbourhood Policy countries that share a border.
Under Priority 2, this Call for Proposals will co-finance activities that aim to enhance cross-border disaster preparedness. End-users will be civil protection authorities and stakeholders in Member States, Participating States, IPA beneficiaries not participating in the Mechanism, and/or European Neighbourhood Policy countries that share a border.

Topic: Prevention and Preparedness for Marine Pollution At Sea and On Shore
Over the past decades, regional, EU and international regulatory framework, preventive measures and technical cooperation helped to decrease the rates of marine and coastal pollution. However, such environmental risks from shipping or offshore accidents and from illegal discharges, cannot be completely eliminated. Moreover, as experienced in the past years, those risks have become more complex in terms of variety of pollutants and uncertainties about their impact, behaviour, as well as effectiveness of available recovery measures. They call for an increased operational knowledge and capability and for a more coordinated and holistic approach to marine pollution incident management at sea and on shore among different sectors involved.
This topic aims to enhance prevention of and protection from the effects of maritime disasters.
Scope:
Applicants are invited to focus on one of the following call priorities (specific objectives):
Priority 1: Developing response capacity for marine pollution incidents
Increasing complexity of maritime risks due to changes in maritime transport, fuels and hazardous cargos, requires a review and step-up of the capacity of responders as well as improved monitoring, detection and response tools to different pollutants. It is important that such capacity development takes into account a variety of pressures for marine environment and their current management, and aims towards more flexible and versatile capabilities that can serve across multiple areas.
Priority 2: Enhancing regional and cross-sectoral coordination
European regional coordination in the area of marine pollution disaster risk management is mainly built and undertaken in the Regional Sea Conventions, to most of which EU is a Contracting Party. Therefore, this call particularly supports strategic prevention and preparedness goals and actions endorsed or initiated under these Conventions, when regional resources are not sufficient for their implementation. Furthermore, the ongoing regional work does not always sufficiently involve other relevant sectors, leaving room for fragmentation or lack of coordination. The call aims to address these gaps.
Activities that can be funded
Under Priority 1, this Call for Proposals will co-finance activities that aim to increase capacity of responders, including development of advanced methodologies supporting training and exercises as well as improving technology and tools for better monitoring, detection and response to at-sea and coastal pollution. Such tools and methodologies should take into account different response functions and their interactions, integrate lessons identified in incidents and exercises and support recent or new strategic initiatives undertaken at European or regional level.
Under Priority 2, this Call will co-finance activities that aim to strengthen joint prevention and preparedness actions within the European regional sea areas as well as inter-regional initiatives when more efficiency or effectiveness can be achieved. The call will also co-finance activities aiming to strengthen operational links between at-sea and shoreline pollution responders as well as other relevant sectors for a more integrated and coordinated approach.

Topic: Prevention and Preparedness for Marine Pollution At-See and On-Shore
Marine pollution risk management is an integral part of the Union Civil Protection Mechanism. It covers at-sea and on-shore implications of deliberate and accidental spills of oil and other harmful substances.
Although shipping has become safer over the past decades, the current trend shows a considerable increase in ship size, increase in the overall maritime traffic and variety of possible pollutants transported as well as a reduced navigational space due to other maritime activities and demand for space, such as energy generation and marine protected areas. The reported number of small and ’’unknown’’ spills has also risen significantly. These and other developments require further risk reduction and preparedness measures, including the use of advanced and innovative technologies as well as the evaluation and reinforcement of existing capacities. Furthermore, prevention, preparedness and response to marine and coastal pollution is often a responsibility of multiple authorities and specialised organisations within a country, making the overall pollution risk management rather challenging. Therefore, better ways of cross-sectoral cooperation of different authorities and actors involved should be explored and developped.
Finally, cooperation in combating marine pollution is deeply rooted in the cross-border and regional approach. While it is already well-advanced in some of the regional European seas, other regions have not yet established a strong framework for joint activities. Moreover, inter-regional cooperation on common priorities, sharing good practice, training and exercising could be strengthened.
This topic aims to enhance prevention of and protection from the effects of maritime disasters.
Aplicants are invited to focus on one of the following call priorities (specific objectives):
Priority 1: Developing response capacity for marine pollution incidents

","single-stage
Deadline date","Scope:
Specific challenge: Advances in many complex products and buildings, such as energy efficient buildings, electrical and electronic equipment (EEE), (electric) vehicles, airplanes, multi-material packaging solutions, bring to the society benefits in the form of a better performance, reduced transport weight, decreased energy consumption etc. Complex products contain many different raw materials and their reuse, recycling and recovery schemes are also complex and imply different steps, ranging from collection and logistics to refining and purification of materials.
New solutions are needed for the extraction of the raw materials from more complex products and buildings containing a multitude of minerals and metals (including Critical Raw Materials and other technology metals), wood-fibre based materials, polymers and plastics etc.
This specific challenge is identified in the Action area on Recycling of raw materials from products and buildings of the European Innovation Partnership (EIP) on Raw Materials.
Scope: All proposals should facilitate the market uptake of solutions developed through industrially-driven multidisciplinary consortia. Proposals shall address only one of the following issues of sustainable recycling and recovery of raw materials:
         developing innovative technological solutions, including pre-processing technologies, comprehensive metallurgical recovery and advanced information and communication technologies, for the recovery of minerals and metals (including Critical Raw Materials), polymers and plastics, and wood-fibre based materials from complex end-of-life products;
           developing solutions for a better recovery of raw materials (metals, aggregates, concrete, bricks, plasterboard, glass, polymers and plasctics and wood) from construction and demolition (C&D) waste, particularly from the most promising objects, such as deconstruction of non-residential buildings.
The proposals should develop the solutions proving the concept and feasibility at the level of Technology Readiness Levels (TRL) 5-6; please see part G of the General Annex.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 6 and 8 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected impact: In the medium to longer term unlocking a significant volume of various raw materials within EU28 through conversion of wastes or raw materials not currently exploited into valuable resources. In the shorter term measurable increase in the efficiency of exploitation of secondary raw materials’ deposits ('urban mines') against the state of the art. Increased range and yields of recovered materials and energy efficiency, reduced environmental footprint measured by qualitative and quantitative indicators. Contribution to achieving the objectives of the EIP on Raw Materials.

Specific Challenge: The complexity and heterogeneity of waste streams require coordination and networking between researchers, entrepreneurs and public authorities to harmonise technologies, processes and services, to profit from benchmarking, sharing best practices, and gender mainstreaming, and to use or develop standards. Insufficient cooperation between different value chain players in several raw materials sectors results in lower recycling rates or suboptimal use of raw materials from an environmental and socio-economic point of view. Improved cooperation within or along different value chains and among stakeholders, including a participatory role of citizens, representing the wider society, and civil society organisations, can lead to more efficient use of raw materials and to waste reduction.
The global nature of the waste management challenge requires coordination, pooling of resources and support to the definition of global objectives and strategies, and holds a potential for export of eco-innovative solutions and seizing new markets. Dissemination at international level of knowledge on waste management, including environmental regulations and standards, can contribute to turning waste into a resource at global level and to setting up resource efficient waste management systems and technologies and services, particularly in developing countries and emerging economies. To this end, enhanced forms of participatory processes for all stakeholders are needed.
Scope: Proposals shall address the following issue:
Raw materials partnerships: Creation of a common multi-stakeholder platform focused on a limited number of key raw materials across their whole value chain. This should involve partners from across the value chain, including mining, processing, recycling, application, public sectors (national/regional/local) and civil society, while respecting the conditions of each value chain. The action shall support implementation of the European Innovation Partnership (EIP) on Raw Materials.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of up to EUR 1.5 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected impact:
In the medium term, better-informed decision-making at EU and national level as well as by industry. Increased EU raw materials knowledge and transparency of EU raw materials information, for the benefit of various stakeholders. Boosting the raw material sector through an interdisciplinary and transnational cooperation allowing matching the supply and demand from the EU downstream industries. In the longer term, improving availability of key raw materials, while creating greater added value to the economy and more jobs. Facilitation of exchange of information and increased knowledge and use of the most advanced, economically effective and innovative technologies in the whole value chain of raw materials. Contribution to the implementation of the EIP on Raw Materials.

Specific Challenge:Through innovation-oriented public procurement, the public sector can foster lead markets and generate critical mass of demand for eco-innovative solutions, thus providing an important boost to resource efficiency and to waste prevention, reuse and recycling. Public purchasing of innovative solutions for resource efficiency and waste management and prevention has not yet been deployed on a large scale. It can lead to a sharing of the additional risks and costs involved in buying and using eco-innovative solutions and to a more rapid market uptake of such solutions. Barriers to public procurement of innovative solutions include the absence of cross-border coordination and lack of access to best practices and to knowledge of close-to-market innovative solutions. 
Scope:Proposals should lead to the establishment of a buyers' group of public procurers to overcome the fragmentation of demand for eco-innovative solutions for resource efficiency and waste management and prevention in the EU and to reinforce their early deployment. The buyers' group will be responsible for drawing common specifications (including needs assessment, financial modelling of different approaches market consultation involving the supply chain, drafting of specifications, risk management plan), and should prepare for a joint or coordinated procurement. The feasibility of launching a joint or coordinatedpublic procurement of innovation (PPI) should be assessed and tested. Preparation activities for the joint or coordinated PPI will be supported, not the costs of the procurement resulting from any PPI procedures.
Expected impact:Creation of a critical mass of procurers of eco-innovative solutions that would not otherwise be able to penetrate the market. Leverage of additional investment in research and innovation. Demonstrable contribution of public sector innovation and increased mobilisation of SMEs and industrial partners to promoting resource efficient products and services. Creation of new markets in the area of resource efficiency in the short and medium term. Movement from product purchase to service delivery.

[2014]Proposals should pool the necessary financial resources from the participating national (or regional) research programmes with a view to implementing a joint call for proposals resulting in grants to third parties with EU co-funding to support the priorities identified in the Strategic Research Agenda of the Water Joint Programming Initiative (JPI). Proposers should also consider implementing other joint activities including additional joint calls without EU co-funding. In 2014, this call should support research and innovation developing technological solutions and services to support the implementation of EU water policy, in particular for water distribution and measurement, waste water treatment and reuse, desalination, floods and droughts etc.
[2015] Proposals should pool the necessary financial resources from the participating national (or regional) research programmes with a view to implementing a joint call for proposals resulting in grants to third parties with EU co-funding to support the priorities identified in the Strategic Research Agenda of the Water JPI. In line with the EU's strategy for international cooperation in research and innovation[1] international cooperation with international partners is encouraged. Proposers should also consider implementing other joint activities including additional joint calls without EU co-funding. In 2015 the call should support research and innovation to support the implementation of EU water policy, in particular on sustainable water use in agriculture, to increase water use efficiency and reduce soil and water pollution.
Expected impact: Better use of scarce human and financial resources in the area of water R&I. Reduced fragmentation of water research and innovation efforts across Europe. Improved synergy, coordination and coherence between national and EU funding in the relevant research fields through transnational collaboration. Improved implementation of research and innovation programmes in these fields through exchange of good practices. Contribution to the implementation of the JPI on Water.

Specific challenge: Effective use and market exploitation of water research results is often limited by the lack of adequate knowledge exchange practices and mechanisms. The same applies for research that gives answers to policy implementation, like achieving good status under the Water Framework Directive (WFD) or good environmental status under the Marine Strategy Framework Directive and achieving the objectives of other EU water legislation. This is exacerbated by the fact that water research and innovation faces several multidisciplinary challenges and involves a wide variety of policy sectors, decision makers, public and private users and stakeholders at various levels.
Critical mass is needed for knowledge exchange, to ensure wide applicability of research results, facilitate the translation of knowledge into use by various stakeholders, reduce unnecessary duplication of efforts, raise public awareness of water-related issues and promote innovation and business development.
Scope: Proposals should aim to address only one of the following issues:
         promote the dissemination and exploitation of EU funded activities, including  relevant ICT-based tools and platforms and their integration for market leadership in many fragmented areas, develop appropriate policy briefs, and foster knowledge sharing and continuous benchmarking across the EU and Associated Countries to ensure wider application of innovative solutions and further demonstrate their potential to solve water-related challenges, including through river basin networks and River Basin Districts; or
         take stock of existing practical and scientific knowledge in the various sectors and identify research gaps with a view to avoiding overlaps between key regional, national, European and international activities, taking into account the implementation of the WFD; or
         promote water-related innovation and business development, help cluster eco-innovative companies and develop innovative financial instruments; or
         develop a coordinated approach to the integration of the water and waste sectors in the 'Smart Cities and Communities' EIP[1], identifying research and innovation needs which could lead to future actions, promoting exchange of best practice between public authorities and stakeholders involved, and increasing preparedness and planning capacities of all the relevant actors.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU in the range of EUR 1 million for sub-topic a) would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected impact:
Enhanced science- and evidence-based decision making in the field of water. Application of best management practices and new developments to address needs and opportunities in the water field. Enhanced interface between water and innovation policies. Rapid market uptake of research results in line with the priority areas of the EIP 'Water'[2]. A more integrated community of researchers and users extending across disciplines, countries, organisations and sectors. Improved public engagement in research and improved public understanding of the dynamic nature of water systems and the role of innovation in the water sector. Integration of the water and waste sectors into the Smart Cities EIP, reinforcing its ultimate goal of contributing to achieving the 3 bottom line objectives (20-20-20).

Specific challenge: Sustainable water supply and sanitation is fundamental to the food security, health, survival, societal well-being and economic growth in developing countries, especially in Africa. Developing countries are also particularly vulnerable to water-related problems which are expected to be exacerbated in the future by more frequent and severe floods and droughts due to climate change. A prerequisite for tackling these challenges is a profound analysis of water resources at cross-boundary catchment scales, pressures on water resources and conflicts in water use that require sound approaches to water management, taking into consideration broader socio-economic factors and greater gender balance in decision making. International cooperation can play an important role in mitigating negative effects. 
At the same time, the EU should aim to strengthen international cooperation also with emerging economies, especially China and India, through strategic partnerships in the field of water. This will allow for joint development of technological solutions that, capitalising on the mutual knowledge and experience of the water industry in EU Member States and these countries, have a great potential for further replication and market uptake. Building on its leadership in international water-related negotiations, the EU will promote its experience in water policy and river management in order to share best practices.
Scope: Proposals shall address the following issue:
Strategic cooperation partnerships[1] for water research and innovation between Europe and the rest of the world, promoting the creation of networks of companies (including SMEs), entrepreneurs, not for profit organisations, policy makers, regulators and funding bodies to create business and social opportunities. In line with the EU’s strategy for international cooperation in research and innovation[2] proposals contributing to implementing on-going international activities and partnerships where the EU Member States are jointly committed to providing a more coherent approach to research and innovation (e.g. EU/Member States-India research and innovation partnership on water, China-Europe Water Platform) that aim at establishing a shared strategic research and innovation agenda will be given priority.
Expected impacts: 
Creation of market opportunities for European water innovations outside Europe, thus supporting the implementation of the EIP 'Water' and its priority areas. Support to the implementation of the objectives set by the Strategic Forum for International Science and Technology Cooperation[3].

Europe urgently needs more innovators to stay competitive in the coming decades and to spur economic growth. The large number of well-educated women who, for various reasons, including lack of awareness, do not consider entrepreneurship as an option, represents a tremendous untapped pool of innovation.
Awards have a strong potential to drive innovation through the recognition of achievements and the promotion of role models. Therefore, the European Commission created in 2011 a Prize for Women Innovators to increase public awareness of this issue and to encourage women to exploit the commercial and business opportunities and become entrepreneurs.
After the success of the forerunners of the contest in 2011, 2014 and 2016, the Commission intends to continue its drive to spotlight women researchers who have brought outstanding innovations to the market.
For the 4th the EC wants to highlight the outstanding achievements of women innovators who have (co-) founded a successful company and brought an innovation to market and benefitted from Research and Innovation funding from the public or private sector.
The Commission will award up to three ""EU Prize for Women Innovators"" and one ""Rising Innovator Award"" following a European-wide contest. New in this edition, female innovators (aged 30 years or under) at the start of their careers can win the new prize for the Rising Innovator 2017!

Specific challenge:Facilitate trans-national co-operation between NCPs within the ‘Spreading Excellence and Widening Participation’ part with a view to identifying and sharing good practices and raising the general standard of support to programme applicants, taking into account the diversity of actors that make up the constituency of this ‘Spreading Excellence and Widening Participation’ part.
 Scope:Support will be given to a consortium of formally nominated NCPs in the area of the ‘Spreading Excellence and Widening Participation’ part. The activities will be tailored according to the nature of the area, and the priorities of the NCPs concerned. Various mechanisms may be included, such as benchmarking, joint workshops, enhanced cross-border brokerage events, specific training linked to this ‘Spreading Excellence and Widening Participation’ part as well as to gender dimension of Research and Innovation and twinning schemes.  Special attention will be given to enhance the competence of NCPs, including helping less experienced NCPs rapidly acquire the know-how accumulated in other countries. 
 The focus throughout should be on issues specific to the ‘Spreading Excellence and Widening Participation’ part and should not duplicate actions foreseen in the NCP network for quality standards and horizontal issues under ‘Spreading Excellence and Widening Participation’.
 Only NCPs from EU Member States and Associated Countries, and which have been officially appointed by the relevant national authorities are eligible to participate in and receive funding for this action.
 The consortium should have a good representation of experienced and less experienced NCPs.
 Submission of a single proposal is encouraged. NCPs from EU Member States or Associated Countries choosing not to participate as a member of the consortium should be identified and the reason explained in the proposal. These NCPs are nevertheless invited and encouraged to participate in the project activities (e.g. workshops), and the costs incurred by the consortium for such participation (e.g. travel costs paid by the consortium) may be included in the estimated budget and be eligible for funding by the Commission.
  The Commission will only fund one proposal under this topic.

Objectives pursued
Europe urgently needs more innovators to stay competitive in the coming decades and to spur economic growth. The large number of well-educated women researchers who, for various reasons, including lack of awareness, do not consider entrepreneurship as an option, represents a tremendous untapped pool of innovation.
Awards have a strong potential to drive innovation through the recognition of achievements and the promotion of role models. Therefore, the European Commission created in 2011 a Prize for Women Innovators to increase public awareness of this issue and to encourage women to exploit the commercial and business opportunities offered by their research projects and become entrepreneurs. After the success of the forerunners of the competition in 2011 and 2014, the Commission intends to continue its drive to spotlight women researchers who have brought outstanding innovations to the market. The prizes will boost the public awareness of the, potential, importance and contribution of women researchers to entrepreneurship and will encourage entrepreneurial women to become innovators. Although women are more and more active in research, there are still too few women creating innovative enterprises. This represents an untapped potential for Europe which needs all resources to remain competitive and find solutions to our societal challenges. The prizes will therefore help to achieve the objectives of the Europe 2020 strategy.
Expected results
The Commission plans to award up to three ""EU Prize for Women Innovators 2016"" following a European-wide contest. The prizes are addressed to women who have founded or co-founded a company and who themselves or their company have benefitted from EU funding related to Research and Innovation. The prizes will not reward research or innovation proposed for the future, but only achievements that have been already obtained by the candidate
The contest will target women who have benefited from EU research and innovation programmes and who have combined their scientific excellence with an aptitude for business in setting up innovative enterprises. Entries will have to clearly state the involvement of the contestants in the research and innovation activities and the potential of their product or service to access the market, also highlighting the relevant economic and societal impact."

","single-stage
Deadline date","ExpectedOutcome:
The European Universities initiative, currently piloted under Erasmus+ and supported through Horizon 2020 has created enormous dynamism across higher education sector to jointly create critical mass and implement institutional transformation strategies towards universities of the future, involving also surrounding ecosystems. The European Universities will be drivers of a European Excellence Initiative in the future with a distinct widening module.
Through the European Excellence Initiative, Horizon Europe’s support aims at the transformation of higher education sector and their surrounding ecosystems, including non-university research centres. The Excellence Initiative would thereby mobilise local and regional government’s investments in higher education sector (in its broadest sense). It will also include research activities in strategically relevant domains with a centre of gravity in widening countries. The widening dimension and relevance will be closely monitored on the grounds of an overall distribution KPI.
Pending the evaluation of the European Universities pilot portfolio in 2021-2022, the European Excellence Initiative in 2021 will focus on capacity building for networks of higher education institutions and partners in the local ecosystem, with a view of preparing the networks towards the full roll-out of the European Universities initiative in the years to come as announced in the European Skills Agenda adopted by the Commission on 1 July 2020.
Further to its proposals adopted on 30 September 2020 for the new ERA for Research and Innovation and the European Education Area, supported by the Council in its Conclusions, the Commission will engage further with the sector towards developing a higher education transformation agenda.
Projects are expected to contribute to the following outcomes:
Integrated and longer term cooperation between the partner higher education institutions (HEI) in the network, and with actors in surrounding ecosystems, jointly creating critical mass to contribute better to major societal challenges;
Tangible progress towards institutional transformation / modernisation of HEI (in its broadest sense), including through pilots or study cases, with a particular emphasis on the entities located in widening countries;
Strengthened cooperation with a view to raising excellence, global competitiveness, and general attractiveness for international talents and investments, including gender equality provisions; this includes preparations to embark onto the potential future European Universities initiative;
Contribute to a portfolio of successful cooperation models for modernisation/ transformation at research and innovation level, in synergy with HEI’s education dimension; identify remaining barriers at regional/national/EU level hampering cooperation between HEI and modernisation of HEI; act as a regional role model of successful transformation;
Facilitate future synergies between the European Education Area and the European Research Area, in particular in relation to the European Universities alliances.
Scope:
The capacity building towards the European Excellence Initiative aims to significantly strengthening cooperation between at least two organisations from higher education sector in a Widening country (or different Widening countries), by linking it with at least two internationally-leading institutions from two different Member States or Associated Countries.
Enhance the scientific and technological capacity of the linked institutions with a principal focus on the entities from the Widening Country/-ies;
Help raise the excellence profile of the HEI from the Widening country as well as the excellence profile of its staff;
Strengthen considerably the networks towards realising integrated cooperation between the participating entities in the research and innovation dimension, in synergy with the entities’ education and training dimensions.
Proposals are expected to clearly outline the cooperation and strategy for stepping up and stimulating scientific excellence and innovation capacity in defined areas of research and innovation as well as the scientific quality of the partners involved in the exercise. This strategy should include arrangements for institutional transformation according to a shared agenda that could include (a) developing shared research & innovation strategies and roadmaps to create directional and interdisciplinary critical mass, in order to more effectively create impact for society; (b) sharing capacity and resources, through collaborative settings preparing the network towards the establishment of a European Universities alliance or similar long-term network, (c) strengthening attractiveness of researchers’ careers, towards a pipeline of talents crucial for an effective European Research Area, including reform in career assessment; (d) co-operation with surrounding ecosystem actors for the transmission of knowledge and talents, e.g. through creation or reinforcing of technology transfer offices and cooperation platforms; (e) transition to knowledge- and digitally-driven universities, conducting Open Science; (f) creating proximity to and engaging citizens for solving societal challenges; (g) supporting institutional change through inclusive gender equality plans. Where relevant, any links with sustainable development objectives are to be outlined.
The way forward with and within the different priority areas for transformation of universities remains the choice of the beneficiaries. For all areas listed above, where appropriate, legal, regulatory, and financial barriers hampering cooperation among HEI in research and innovation as well as recommendations on the way forward should be identified. More detailed information, including examples of activities that can be supported within these different priority areas can be found in the accompanying information document [1], which is published together with this work programme.
The common strategy should include a comprehensive set of activities to be supported. These should include at least a number of the following: short term staff exchanges; expert visits and short-term on-site or virtual training; workshops; conference attendance; organisation of joint summer school type activities; dissemination and outreach activities; research management and administration; capacity building for research management and technology transfer; explorative research projects (led by widening partners) to develop new research strands etc.; capacity building for the application of open science practices.
Proposals should target the higher education sector; this may include any type of university, research organisations, academies of science, polytechnic universities, universities of applied science, and specialised public laboratories. HEI partners in surrounding ecosystems, such as businesses, societal actors or other non-academic entities are encouraged to be involved as partner organisations.

Deadline date","ExpectedOutcome:
This topic aims at supporting activities that are enabling or contributing to one or several expected impacts of destination 2 ‘Living and working in a health-promoting environment’. To that end, the proposal under this topic should aim for delivering results that are directed, tailored towards and contributing to all of the following expected outcomes:
The EU is reinforced as an internationally recognised driver of innovation in chemicals risk assessment and thereby substantially contributing to the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals related to chemicals;
EU and national chemicals risk assessment and management authorities rely on a sustainable Europe-wide research and innovation platform for chemicals risk assessment, as identified in the Council Conclusions[1] of June 2019 ‘Towards a Sustainable Chemicals Policy Strategy of the Union’ and in the ‘Chemicals Strategy for Sustainability’[2], to provide joint new knowledge and innovate risk assessment processes;
EU and national chemical risk assessment agencies and the scientific community enhance their collaboration and move towards ‘one substance – one assessment’ with shared evidence, tools and methodologies cutting across sectors;
The Common European Green Deal Data Space is empowered, by providing it with reliable, relevant, curated and FAIR[3] data on chemicals in line with the European Strategy for Data[4];
Synergies are established with relevant activities derived from other European Green Deal policy areas, such as the ‘Farm to Fork strategy’, the ‘Biodiversity Strategy for 2030’, the ‘8th Environment Action Programme’ and the ‘Zero Pollution Action Plan for Air, Water and Soil’, to understand and address their needs for research and innovation in chemicals risk assessment and ensure a better protection of the environment and human health from hazardous chemical exposures;
Public authorities and industry engaged in developing a circular economy, including better waste management, as defined in the EU’s ‘Industrial Strategy’[5] and the ‘New Circular Economy Action Plan’[6], are supported with innovation in chemicals risk assessment.
Workers are better protected from chemical risks as set out in the ‘EU Strategic Framework on Health and Safety at Work 2014-2020’[7] through better insight into exposures and health impacts and improved safety measures.
Scope:
Chemicals risk assessors and managers are faced with data and knowledge gaps and lack of tools and methods, to speed up and prioritise risk assessments and capture risks from existing and emerging substances across regulatory domains. The lack of available or accessible information increases the risk of ‘regrettable’ substitutions and slows down the design of safer chemicals. A diverse landscape of regulatory frameworks and actors carrying out risk assessment of chemicals for their specific purpose has resulted in a fragmented approach. Risks to human and environmental health are still in certain cases considered separately, while in most cases they are inherently interrelated.
To enable risk assessors and risk managers to respond to current and future challenges, the Partnership[8] should stimulate research and innovation in chemicals risk assessment by developing a collaborative network with public research entities. A common research and innovation programme should be established by national and EU risk assessors and risk managers in consultation with relevant stakeholders (academia, industry, associations and others).
Activities of the Partnership should be complementary and subsidiary to obligations under existing regulatory frameworks, and should coordinate with these as relevant. The Partnership should become a reference centre for research questions related to chemicals risk assessment, including those emerging from other Horizon Europe partnerships or missions. The Partnership is expected to establish relevant collaborations with other Horizon Europe partnerships and missions as set out in the working document on ‘Coherence and Synergies of candidate European partnerships under Horizon Europe’[9] as well as to explore collaborations with other relevant activities at EU and international level. The Partnership should align with EU-wide initiatives on open access and FAIR data[10].
The Partnership’s governance structure should engage upfront risk managers and risk assessors to coordinate, steer and frame the research and innovation activities, facilitate the use and uptake of the results in a regulatory context and contribute to a science based communication of the risk of chemicals. The Partnership’s governance and operational structures should also foster a dialogue on sustainability, beyond funding from EU research and innovation framework programmes, with political decision-makers and risk assessors.
Main blocks of activity:
1. Set-up and operate an EU-wide cross-disciplinary network to identify and agree on research and innovation needs and support research uptake into regulatory chemical risk assessment.
A dialogue and priority-setting process should be established, bringing together European regulatory entities and risk assessment agencies to develop a strategic research and innovation agenda for chemicals risk assessment in collaboration with the scientific community. This process should also facilitate access and uptake of new scientific knowledge that can contribute to regulatory science by policy-makers and risk assessors.
Relevant synergies should be fostered with other initiatives at national, EU or international level and targeted communication and dissemination should be implemented to ensure openness and transparency of this Partnership towards all concerned stakeholders. The Partnership should build on and extend the concept of National Hubs developed under the European Joint Programme on Human Biomonitoring, HBM4EU[11]. Targeted citizen actions should be envisaged to increase their understanding of risks related to exposure to chemicals and reinforce their trust in risk assessment and risk management processes.
2. Carry out joint EU research and innovation activities on identified priorities to support the current regulatory risk assessment processes and respond to emerging challenges.
The Partnership should drive innovation in environmental and human exposure assessment. . New tools and methods for environmental and human exposure monitoring, including in occupational settings, and to gather data on lifestyle and consumption behaviour, should be developed, validated and their harmonised use promoted. Biomarkers of effects in environment and in human should be developed as a proxy of environmental and health outcomes. Collaborations with existing programmes should be fostered; however, when required and relevant, the partnership can carry out monitoring and exposure assessment activities. This could entail monitoring of environmental media and human exposure to chemicals from various sources and exposure routes. For human biomonitoring, the Partnership should build on the results of HBM4EU and further exploit these as well as perform new studies for prioritised chemicals and regulatory questions. Moreover, human biomonitoring activities should be integrated in the wider exposure assessment and risk assessment contexts.
Toxicological or eco-toxicological studies to generate new data for chemical substances and mixtures relevant to public health (mechanistic, in silico, in vitro or in vivo), beyond the data required from industry under REACH or by other regulations, should be designed and performed, taking into account the Reduce-Refine-Replace (3Rs) principle and any regulatory requirements for their relevance. Novel methods for toxicological hazard assessment aligned with identified needs should be developed, and existing methods improved, including methods that can reliably screen (groups of) substances allowing to select the substances for which a full safety assessment is required. New Approach Methodologies (NAMs) should be integrated with classical experimental designs to improve hazard characterization and their regulatory acceptance promoted through validation or applicability studies.
The performance of current methodologies employed in regulatory risk assessment should be assessed to identify methodological knowledge gaps and R&I needs. Validation and standardisation of results and methods of the Partnership or from collaborating projects should be pursued, e.g. development of OECD Test Guidelines, to encourage their use in regulatory risk assessment. Integrated Approaches to Testing and Assessment (IATA), integrative exposure and exposure reconstruction models and practical approaches for regulatory risk assessment of single, aggregated or combined exposure should be developed and their regulatory uptake fostered. Causal associations between (combined) exposures to chemicals and health outcomes should be investigated.
3. Strengthen existing capacities and build EU-wide, transdisciplinary research and innovation platforms to support chemical risk assessment
A data policy in line with FAIR data principles, taking into account General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) related challenges, should be developed and implemented in the Partnership for data management, harmonisation, interoperability and exchange. Building on accepted data formats and existing data platforms[12], solutions to collect, store, manage and permit access to new data generated by R&I activities in the partnership should be proposed. Access and linkage to existing data collections should be facilitated. Innovative methods for data analysis should be pursued, including uncertainty analysis, data mining, and machine learning.
Innovative approaches in chemical risk assessment should be investigated and, if validated, promoted including at least the following: 1) supporting the European Commission’s work on defining the Safe-and-Sustainable-by-Design concept and implementation criteria and proposing a toolbox to support the application of these criteria; 2) investigating how to further support the initial pilot study on an EU Early Warning System launched by the European Commission in 2019; and 3) making models and modelling approaches accessible and compliant with FAIR principles via an open source repository.
The Partnership should, in cooperation with appropriate EU and National reference laboratory networks, identify, and, when needed, enhance existing networks and develop new networks. These networks should aim at standardising methods, making available Quality Assurance/Quality Control (QA/QC) schemes and promoting the uptake of new methods and tools through training and peer-to-peer learning. In addition, specific training should be undertaken for different groups of stakeholders, including own partners, to ensure a wide use of data, methods, tools and models promoted by the Partnership.
Partner composition, geographical coverage and funding conditions:
The Partnership is open to all EU Member States as well as countries associated to Horizon Europe and will remain open to those wanting to join during the Partnership’s lifetime.
Beneficiaries should preferably be:
National institutions in charge of chemical risk assessment and carrying out related research and innovation activities.
Exceptionally, if the national risk assessors prefer not to participate as beneficiaries and manage a network of affiliated entities, other solutions can be envisaged but must be duly justified and, when to conditions for participating as affiliated entities exists, the national risk assessor may participate under such status.
To encourage national coordination, participation as beneficiary should be limited to two entities per country; the use of affiliated entities is thus strongly encouraged, when the conditions for participating as affiliated entity exist.
Affiliated entities are defined under the Horizon Europe Model Grant Agreement and, in this specific topic, should be:
Academia and research organisations that are part of the national networks on research for chemicals risk assessment and have established links to the risk-assessing institutions.
National risk assessors or government agencies in the exceptional case they will not be beneficiaries as mentioned above.
Depending on their individual legal and operational frameworks and in agreement with the relevant services of the European Commission (partner DGs), EU Agencies involved in chemicals risk assessment and/or producing knowledge on chemicals’ safety may also join the Partnership, e.g. as beneficiaries.
Collaboration with the European Commission's Joint Research Centre (JRC) should be considered to facilitate the sharing of chemical monitoring data in IPCHEM[13], and in other areas of mutual interest, such as (bio)monitoring, novel approaches for risk assessment including non-animal approaches, safe and sustainable design of chemicals, training and capacity building.
The expected duration of the partnership is seven years.
The Horizon Europe contribution will be limited to a maximum of 50% of the total eligible costs of the action with a maximum of EUR 200 million of EU contribution.

","19 December 2017
","single-stage
Deadline date","Scope:
The present Call for Proposals aims at funding projects of information and awareness-raising campaigns in the area of migration in Algeria, The Gambia, Guinea Conakry, Ivory Coast, Niger, Mali, Morocco, Senegal or Tunisia [1], aiming at preventing irregular migration and, in particular, migrant smuggling and trafficking of human beings, as defined in the AMIF Annual Work Programme for 2017 [2].
The general objective of the present Call for Proposal is to contribute to the change of perceptions and behaviour of third country nationals pondering irregularly migrating to the EU and key influencers of their decisions.
The goal of this Call for Proposals is to support projects that pursue the following specific objectives:
to provide trusted, factual, balanced information on the risks of irregular migration – during the journey (dangers of migrating irregularly) and after arrival (hardship of living in the EU irregularly and return), as well as on relevant legal alternatives of migration and on economic opportunities of staying in the country of origin;
to empower credible voices in countering migrant smugglers' narratives on irregular migration and the diasporas' narratives on living irregularly in the EU;
to strengthen multi-stakeholder cooperation between actors such as civil society organisations, researchers, media outlets, local state actors, diaspora and where relevant other stakeholders;
to enhance the sustainability of communication activities and results of the campaign.
Project proposals submitted under the present Call for Proposals should build on the lessons learnt from the past and on-going information and awareness-raising campaigns and activities, including those implemented by the EU, Member States and International Organisations in third countries [3]. The projects should seek synergies with communication activities being implemented under actions funded by the EU, like the relevant projects co-funded by AMIF [4], and projects funded by the EU Trust Fund for Africa [5], as well as, where relevant, with those implemented by EU Member States, International Organizations and other partners.
Project proposals should consist of the following key elements:
Preparatory research, in view of developing a tailored communication strategy, in particular to identify target audience(s) of the communication activities, its(their) characteristics, motivations, information needs and gaps as well as media access and consumption, as to design the most effective approach to influence its(their) behaviour. The preparatory research should take into account results and lessons learnt of previous campaigns and communication activities carried out in the same country and should use available primary and secondary data and own analysis.
A tailored communication strategy based on the outcome of the preparatory research, in particular to define:
the geographical scope of the campaign (which country and which part of that country in particular) and the specific migratory context (country of origin vs transit);
the target audience and its segmentation (gender, age, education, profession, etc.);
a comprehensive concept, including the overarching idea for the campaign structure, the key messages to be used throughout the period of implementation of the activities and the key visual elements;
a creative approach allowing for participation and feedback from the target audience, e.g. by fostering use of smartphone apps and text messaging for both multiplication and monitoring/feedback purposes;
the communication channels to be used ensuring a mix of traditional and social media, including media-buying plan where appropriate, as well as local level outreach, and taking into account the habits of each segment of the target audience in terms of media access and consumption and access and use of trusted information;
alternative communication tools where appropriate, such as theatre plays, community-led debates, contests (e.g. photo, song, video) and awards (e.g. for journalists), school visits, testimonials, involvement of celebrities etc., adapting them to the habits and characteristics of each context and segment of the target audience;
key performance indicators (KPIs), both qualitative and quantitative, with baseline and targets to be used to monitor the implementation and to assess the result of the campaign.
detailed plan for the roll-out and management of the campaign;
3. The production and implementation of the communication campaign, in particular:
pre-testing of concepts and content of the campaign on sample groups of identified target audience;
production of content of the campaign;
rolling-out of the communication activities;
4. Monitoring and evaluation of the results and impact of the campaign, in particular:
collecting and analysing of the key performance indicators (KPIs) defined in the communication strategy;
providing for adjustments of the on-going campaign if necessary;
allowing for lessons learnt and good practices for future campaigns;
5. A strategy for the sustainability of the campaign activities, in particular:
engaging with state and non-state actors, throughout the campaign, with a view to sharing know-how and best practices, raising their awareness and building ownership;

","AMIF Action Grant
","21 November 2017
","single-stage
Deadline date","Scope:
In the current context characterised by negative perceptions on migration among some segments of the public opinion, the integration of third-country nationals can be facilitated by communication activities promoting a positive narrative on migration and presenting the contribution that third-country nationals can make to societies in different areas. Considering that such communication and awareness raising activities will be all the more effective if promoted by a variety of stakeholders, it is particularly relevant to promote partnerships among local, regional and national authorities as well as civil society organisations with the aim to develop and implement such initiatives.
The objectives of this priority are to:
Support awareness raising projects aiming at highlighting the positive contribution of migrants to our societies;
Communicating real facts about migration and integration;
Combating stereotypes against third-country nationals;
Contribute to giving a voice to third-country nationals in the public debate on migration and integration.
Projects applications submitted under the present call for proposals under priority 1 can include the following activities (this list is non-exhaustive):
projects in schools, sport clubs or youth clubs – targeting youth in particular;
creation of audio-visual campaigns, also to be distributed to the public at large through the use of social media, which can include testimonies from third-country nationals and EU citizens on their personal experiences related to migration and integration;
training for media professionals on how to find and communicate real facts about migration and the contribution of migrants to society;
public communication campaigns by local or regional authorities.
Projects should in particular aim at providing clearer facts on migration and integration as there is a knowledge gap among EU citizens (for instance people tend to overestimate the size of migration). Communication activities should be evidence-based (facts and figures) in order to build a positive narrative on migration and integration and contribute to change perceptions in that respect, even if the use of anecdotal evidence and story-telling can also play a role. Existing information and data on public perceptions on migration should be taken into account, for instance the data made available by the recently created Observatory of Public Attitudes to Migration[1].
Effective ways of communicating on migration/integration should be proposed through the projects including by adapting key messages to specific audiences which have negative preconceived attitudes towards migration/integration.

Integration happens first and foremost at local level and will only succeed if exchanges between third-country nationals and host-country nationals are fostered and encouraged from the very early stages through different activities such as cultural, sport or other activities. Volunteering can be a particularly effective way to foster the interaction between EU citizens and third country nationals at the local level. Therefore, projects submitted under this priority might include a volunteering component, involving both EU citizens and the third-country nationals. Synergies with the ""European Solidarity Corps""[https://europa.eu/youth/SOLiDARIty_en.] can be created in this regard. The objective is to support local communities making efforts to promote these exchanges and replicate this experience in other communities.
The objectives of this priority are to:
Support community building activities aiming at the integration of third country nationals at local level;
Promote exchanges between third-country and host-country nationals at local level;
Build partnerships and cooperation among all the actors involved in promoting integration at community level.
Projects applications submitted under the present call for proposals under priority 2 can include the following activities (this list is non-exhaustive):
cultural exchanges, in particular to promote culture and values of the receiving society, European values and the culture of the country of origin, including in the context of the 2018 European Year for Cultural Heritage;

","AMIF Action Grant
","21 November 2017
","single-stage
Deadline date","Scope:
Resettlement of third-country nationals or stateless persons is one of the avenues that can be offered to displaced persons in need of international protection to enable them to arrive to the EU legally and safely and receive protection. Success or failure of resettlement largely depends on durable integration of resettled persons, many of whom have survived trauma or have one or more vulnerabilities as a result of their personal condition or displacement.
While several Member States have been engaged in resettlement for many years, common and coordinated EU efforts have also been developed in the past two years through the implementation of Council Conclusions of 20 July 2015 and the implementation of the EU-Turkey Statement of 18 March 2016. As part of the regular pledging which enables Member States to benefit from the EU funding support to their resettlement efforts, the Commission launched a new pledging exercise to support Member States' resettlement efforts also in 2018. In parallel, resettlement via private or community sponsorship schemes is increasingly being piloted in Member States.
To enable full, efficient and sustainable integration of resettled persons, integration measures in the pre- and post-arrival phases should be properly linked and co-ordinated, and different stakeholders should work together in order to address and meet the resettled people's needs as well as ensure the engagement of the host communities. Citizens in host communities can play an important role in welcoming and supporting refugees, also through volunteering activities, thus contributing to a faster and fuller integration process.
The objectives of this priority are to support:
– Pre-departure activities aimed at preparing resettled third country nationals for their life in the new country and managing their expectations; as a first step in the integration process, these should serve as a basis for subsequent post-arrival activities.
– Post-arrival activities, especially building on and deepening pre-departure activities, ensuring first reception, and enabling effective integration of resettled people; and
– Capacity-building in the receiving communities, including through the promotion of structured co-operation and partnership among national, regional and local actors, ranging from national administrations to NGOs, associations, refugee organisations, religious institutions, municipalities, volunteer networks, schools, universities, service-providers, potential employers and others.
Projects applications submitted under the present call for proposals under priority 3 can include the following activities (this list is non-exhaustive):
Pre-departure activities could include:
- identifying the specific needs of people to be resettled;
- providing general information on the receiving society, managing expectations and countering myths;
- language training;
- step-by-step guidance through the resettlement, reception and integration process;
- providing information on the receiving society’s legal framework, systems and social and cultural norms, rights and responsibilities;
- workshops on living in a multicultural and multi-religious environment;
- guidance on access to services, money management, etc.;
- first assessment and recognition of skills and qualifications – information on access to the labour market in the host country;
Post-arrival activities could include:
- language training;
- continuing the socio-cultural orientation provided in pre-departure activities;
- continuing the orientation on the receiving society's legal framework, rights, responsibilities and institutions;
- skills training;
- referral to appropriate services, including psychological counselling;
- concrete initiatives fostering the active participation of resettled persons in the receiving society;
- facilitating contacts and exchanges with the host community;
- facilitating contacts with diaspora and refugee organisations
- training officials, volunteers and service-providers on working with resettled people (e.g. sensitising them to vulnerability and experience of trauma);
Activities to prepare host communities for the arrival of resettled people could include:
- identifying the specific needs of resettled people upon arrival;
- preparing the relevant administrative bodies (schools, etc.);
- securing appropriate housing;
- socio-cultural orientation (e.g. information about countries of origin);
- countering myths;
- workshops on living in a multicultural and multi-religious environment;
- direct exchanges between the resettled people and host communities, e.g. through social-cultural activities, the arts, volunteering opportunities, etc;
- creating volunteering opportunities for resettled persons to help them enter in contact with the local community.
While all newcomers to a country face similar challenges, the experiences of resettled refugees are particular and are therefore specifically targeted through this priority. A special attention should be paid to the gender dimension, rights of the child, and vulnerabilities of resettled persons. Activities aimed at asylum seekers and refugees not arriving via resettlement, humanitarian admission, or private/community sponsorship schemes will not be considered for funding under priority 3 of this Call for Proposals."

","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Sources of finance for innovative SMEs should be as diverse as possible in order to cater for their varying needs at different stages of the firm life-cycle and the innovation process. However, more needs to be done to improve such SMEs' access to alternative forms of finance[1] such as peer-to-peer lending, venture debt and convertible loans, equity finance provided by crowdfunding or business angels, and factoring and trade finance. In particular, there is a need to:
Sensitise and improve capacity of financial suppliers such as National Promotional Institutions [2], Banks and enablers, such as National Central Banks, national innovation agencies providing finance about the potential of alternative finance.
Facilitate the exchange of best practices amongst Member States and Associated Countries about regulatory and other measures aiming to make it easier for innovative SMEs to diversify their sources of finance.
Make it easier for niche and specialist providers of alternative finance to market themselves to innovative SMEs seeking such forms of finance.
Develop ways of matching such SMEs to alternative finance schemes and their providers.In particular, developing information architectures across the European Union taking into consideration the potential of technology innovation in finance.
Improve the availability of financial and credit information about innovative SMEs to alternative lenders and investors.
Improve innovative SMEs' awareness and understanding [3] of the types of alternative finance available according to their circumstances and development phase.
Scope:
Proposals should take account of a) the diverse levels of development of the provision of information on access by innovative SMEs to alternative sources of finance across the Member States and Associated Countries; b) target countries where the potential for improvement is highest; c) harness the potential of innovative financial technology; d) take account of best practices with a view to their eventual replication. They should:
Develop a capacity-building strategy and consequent implementation plan that makes use of techniques (tailored for both women and men) such as awareness raising campaigns, coaching, mentoring, workshops, courses, training materials (in particular through social media) as well as knowledge transfer of best practices.
Validate the implementation plan by stakeholders including innovative SMEs, alternative finance providers and public authorities.
Execute the implementation plan.
Review the impact of the implementation plan and possibly adapt the scheme in the light of experience.
The approach taken must complement and build on existing initiatives in this area at EU, national and regional levels, working with them where possible. The proposals must also address how to ensure the continuity of the action beyond the implementation period of the call. Proposers must have and must demonstrate deep knowledge of the issues around access to risk finance by innovative SMEs, have proven experience in this field, and significant experience of capacity-building.
The selected proposal should contribute to the Pilot European Innovation Council [4].
The project duration should be a maximum period of 24 months.
The Commission expects to fund between 1 and 3 proposals.
Expected Impact:
Increased use of alternative forms of finance by innovative SMEs.
Emergence and growth of alternative finance options available to innovative SMEs in Member States and Associated Countries where such options are less available or developed at present.
More cooperation between different suppliers of finance in order to crowd in existing EU, national and regional financing structures targeting innovative SMEs.
Replication in Member States and Associated Countries of successful approaches to encouraging the take-up of alternative finance by innovative SMEs.

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Identify and accelerate the deployment of breakthrough technology routes for almost zero CO2 steel production commercial demonstration by 2030 in Europe.
Scope:
Although the pilot project primarily addresses the steel sector, it should not limit its scope to this sector or to other energy intensive industries only. It should also look at technology solutions stemming from other sectors, identifying technology spill overs from non-related sectors. The pilot project will require close collaboration with relevant European think-tanks, technology and research centres, industrial associations, steel producers, private investors and civil society organisations, as well as with the European institutions (European Parliament, European Council and European Commission), national and regional public bodies.
The activities carried out by the pilot project must include:
1) Analysis and summary of promising technology routes, resulting from research projects globally (EU projects, national or regional funding, third country funding).
Prioritization of the most promising technology routes adjusted to the main steel plants in Europe[1], complemented by a technology roadmap describing the milestones, timing and value chains needed to produce clean steel in Europe[2].
Identification of decarbonisation pathways by 2030 and 2050 in consultation with industry and stakeholders to ensure private sector’s commitment. In addition, non-financial barriers to investments in low-carbon technologies have to be identified and analysed.
2) Identification of investments and of innovative funding mechanisms[3] needed to achieve the reductions specified at point (1).
3) Assessment of the impacts of technologies to be implemented, the optimal industrial sites and of the needed investments. The Assessment shall be structured in accordance with the EU Better Regulation guidelines[4].
The Assessment will include a cost-benefit analysis exploring the three following options: no use[5] of the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC) assets, partial use of the ECSC assets and full use of these assets. In addition, the analysis has to assess if, how and why the EU should take action (including the costs of non-action).
4) Organization of two interactive workshops with external stakeholders and one large final public event to present and disseminate the project’s results.
[1][1] Covering at least 80% of emissions.
[2][2] The technology roadmap should build, among others, on the VUB/IES’ study ‘Industrial Value Chain: A bridge Towards a Carbon Neutral Europe’ (https://www.ies.be/node/4758) and the ‘Decarbonisation Pathways’ produced by Eurelectric (https://www.eurelectric.org/decarbonisation-pathways/). The technology roadmap should advance critical comments and further improvements of the studies developed insofar, focusing on those abovementioned.
[3][3] This also includes exploring synergy of EU funding programmes (as the Research Fund for Coal and Steel (RFCS), the assets of the European Coal and Steel Community i.L (ECSC), Horizon Europe, the EU Innovation Fund, the Fuel Cells and Hydrogen Joint Undertaking, the Bio-Based Industries Joint Undertaking, EU Invest).
[4][4] See, for example, “Better Regulation: guidelines and toolbox”: https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-making-process/planning-and-proposing-law/better-regulation-why-and-how/better-regulation-guidelines-and-toolbox_en .
The Impact Assessment has the main aim to gather evidence in order to support policy-making. In so doing, it verifies the existence of a possible problem and its scale, analysing its causes and consequences. Thereafter, it sets the objectives to be achieved. It also identifies and consults all the affected actors. Finally, it presents solutions and multiple options to achieve the set objectives, comparing these options with regard to their effectiveness, efficiency, coherence, relevance and EU added value.
[5][5] In accordance with Art. 1 of Protocol 37 on the Financial Consequences of the Expiry of the ECSC Treaty and on the RFCS, the use of the assets of the ECSC are intended to finance ‘research in the sectors related to the coal and steel industry’."

The present Call for Proposals aims at funding projects in the area of Integration of third-country nationals.
Project applications submitted under the present Call for Proposals must address at least one of the following priorities:
1. Promoting active participation in society overall
Integration goes beyond having a job. Active participation in other aspects of society is equally important, in particular in educational activities and social activities, including for children. Not only does this contribute to the smooth integration of third-country nationals, it also helps to promote a positive image of migration, combat stereotypes, communicate real facts and change the ‘narrative’ on migration.
Projects applicants could involve volunteers from the European solidarity corps in their projects. In this case, project beneficiaries should make sure they include an insurance for volunteers of the European solidarity corps in their project proposal.
In the evaluation of projects, the inclusion of the gender dimension through specific action empowering women or creating conditions for their active participation will be considered favourably. This needs to be clearly demonstrated through specific objectives and targets.
The objectives are to:
promote the development and implementation of innovative actions to increase third country nationals’ participation in educational and social activities, cultural life, the volunteering sector, media professions, decision‑making/consultation and representation frameworks; and
foster knowledge- and experience‑sharing and capacity‑building on successful action to increase third country nationals’ participation in society, with a particular focus on social activities, cultural life, sport, the volunteering sector, media professions, decision‑making/consultation and representation frameworks.
2. Pre-departure and post-arrival support for the integration of persons in need of international protection who are being relocated within the EU or resettled from a third country
Funding will be available for the following activities to integrate persons in need of international protection who have been relocated from another Member State or resettled from outside the EU:
for people resettled from outside the EU – clearly linked pre-departure and post‑arrival activities;
for people relocated from another Member State – post‑arrival activities building on pre‑departure information activities; and
activities to prepare host communities for the arrival of relocated or resettled people.
Integrated multi-stakeholder partnerships should be sought, ideally between national, regional and local authorities (municipalities) and civil society organisations. Projects could focus on exchanges and mutual learning between stakeholders in Member States with varying degrees of experience of resettlement or relocation.
Projects applicants could involve volunteers from the European Solidarity Corps in their projects. In this case, project beneficiaries should make sure they include an insurance for volunteers of the European Solidarity Corps in their project proposal.
In the evaluation of the projects, the inclusion of the gender dimension will be considered favourably. This needs to be clearly demonstrated through specific objectives and targets.
The objectives are to support:
pre-departure activities aimed at preparing resettled third country nationals for their life in the EU; these should serve as a basis for subsequent post-arrival activities.
specific post-arrival activities, especially building on/deepening pre‑departure activities and enabling effective integration of resettled and relocated people; and
capacity‑building in the receiving communities, in particular for service‑providers and potential employers.
These activities should inter alia address vulnerable groups (e.g. women, children).
Gender mainstreaming
Projects should seek to promote gender equality. Where relevant, applicants should ensure that gender equality issues are taken into account by paying attention to the situation and particular needs of women and men.
Rights of the child mainstreaming
Projects should seek to promote the respect of the rights of the child. Where relevant, applicants should ensure that rights of the child issues are taken into account by paying attention to the situation and particular needs of children.
Equal employment opportunities
The Commission encourages applicants to promote equal employment opportunities for all their staff and team, and to employ an appropriately diverse mix of people.
Applicants should take these objectives into account when planning their project and preparing their application, and demonstrate in their proposal how they will achieve them.
Any action under this Call for Proposals shall respect and shall be implemented in line with the rights and principles enshrined in the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union. Applications should pay appropriate attention to the effects of the project on individual rights and freedoms, as well as to possible remedies. In addition, any action under this Call for Proposals should comply with all relevant ethical principles and all applicable international, EU and national law on ethical issues while carrying out the project.
Scope:
Scope:
The European Union’s objective to constitute an area of freedom, security and justice should be achieved, inter alia, through common measures framing a policy on asylum and immigration, based on solidarity between Member States, which is fair towards third countries and their nationals.
In order to contribute to the development of the common Union policy on asylum and immigration and to the strengthening of the area of freedom, security and justice in the light of the application of the principles of solidarity and responsibility-sharing between the Member States and cooperation with third countries, the Asylum, Migration and Integration Fund (AMIF) was set up. It aims at supporting actions to contribute to the efficient management of migration flows and the implementation, strengthening and development of a common Union approach to asylum and immigration.
In May 2015 the European Commission adopted the European Agenda on Migration (EAM), which brings together the different steps the European Union should take now, and in the coming years, to build up a coherent and comprehensive approach to reap the benefits and address the challenges deriving from migration. Building on the European Agenda on migration and as announced in the communication of 6 April 2016 on the reform of the common European Asylum system and enhancing legal avenues to Europe, the Commission adopted an Action Plan on the integration of third-country nationals on 7 June 2016. The Plan is a general policy framework for integration and includes actions to support Member States across all the policy areas that are crucial for integration:
Pre-departure and pre-arrival measures: including actions to prepare migrants and the local communities for the integration process.
Education: including actions to promote language training, participation of migrant children to Early Childhood Education and Care, teacher training and civic education
Employment and vocational training: including actions to facilitation recognition of qualifications and skills, promote early integration into the labour market and migrants entrepreneurship
Access to basic services: such as housing and healthcare
Active participation and social inclusion: including actions to support exchanges with the receiving society, migrants' participation to cultural life and fighting discrimination.
Legal basis of AMIF are the following regulations:
Regulation (EU) No 516/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 April 2014 establishing the Asylum, Migration and Integration Fund (OJ L 150, 20.05.2014, p. 168)
Regulation (EU) No 514/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 April 2014 laying down general provisions on the Asylum, Migration and Integration Fund and on the instrument for financial support for police cooperation, preventing and combating crime, and crisis management (OJ L 150, 20.05.2014, p. 112).
The AMIF Regulation sets out four specific objectives, respectively to:
(i) strengthen and develop all aspects of the Common European Asylum System, including its external dimension;
(ii) support legal migration to the Member States in accordance with their economic and social needs, such as labour market needs, while safeguarding the integrity of the immigration systems of Member States, and to promote the effective integration of third-country nationals;
(iii) enhance fair and effective return strategies in the Member States which contribute to combating illegal immigration, with an emphasis on sustainability of return and effective readmission in the countries of origin and transit;
(iv) enhance solidarity and responsibility-sharing between the Member States, in particular towards those most affected by migration and asylum flows, including through practical cooperation.
In conformity with Regulation (EU) No 514/2014 Article 6(2), in order to implement the AMIF, the Commission has adopted, on 20 July 2016, the 2016 Annual Work Programme for the financing of Union Actions, which includes this Call for Proposals.
Actions included in the AMIF 2016 AWP will contribute to priorities identified in a Communication on the reform of the Common European Asylum System and enhancing legal avenues to Europe of 6 April 2016 and in the Action Plan on the integration of third country nationals of 7 June 2016
As already announced in the Action Plan on the integration of third-country nationals, the 2016 AMIF Commission Work Programme included 2 priorities for action in the field of integration: promoting active participation in society overall, linked to the policy priority area 5 of the Action Plan on the integration of third country nationals, and pre-departure and post-arrival support for the integration of persons in need of international protection who are being relocated within the EU or resettled from a third country linked to the policy priority area 1 of the Action Plan on the integration of third country nationals."

","single-stage
Deadline date","Scope:
In line with the Partnership Framework approach to promote a coordinated, systematic and structured approach to maximise the synergies and leverages of the Union's internal and external policies, in September 2017 the Commission launched the idea of legal migration pilot projects (Communication on the Delivery of the European Agenda on Migration, COM(2017) 558 final). The main objective of the pilot projects is to promote the role that legal migration can play in the overall management of migratory flows, by encouraging and promoting the development of concrete projects by Member States in the area of legal migration, with a particular focus on labour migration (including opportunities for traineeships).
On 16 April 2018 the Commission launched a call for proposal – managed by the International Centre for Migration Policy Development (ICMPD) - in the framework of the Mobility Partnership Facility (MPF), addressed to EU Member States' public bodies.
This call is complementary to the MPF call to the extent that its purpose is to cover the development of projects on legal migration with third-countries developed by non-public bodies and actors.
The provision of legal migration pathways to the EU is part of a more comprehensive strategy to manage orderly migration flows. Host societies, countries of origin and the migrants themselves stand to benefit from increased share of legal migration in overall flows at the expense of irregular migration. Establishing legal pathways with third countries can also help the EU to address labour and skills' shortages across the labour markets of EU Member States. The scope for more legal pathways could be improved by identifying appropriate mechanisms that could facilitate matching demand and offers for jobs. This includes both temporary/circular and long term mobility, depending on EU Member States' labour market needs.
The involvement of a wide variety of stakeholders, in particular economic actors, is key to the successful implementation of this Priority.
Objectives
Concretely, the objectives of this priority are:
Promotion of specific labour and training-related migration pathways between third-countries and EU Member States, involving employers, other economic and social partners and civil society
Development of actions to achieve a better match between skills and demands in the EU's labour markets, in close cooperation with all relevant labour market actors, including employers, chambers of commerce and industry, national business organizations, trade unions, education and training institutions, including universities, and networks delivering work-related training, and civil society
Knowledge- and experience-sharing on successful actions to promote legal migration to the EU, taking into account the needs of migrants, the host societies as well as countries of origin
Actions
Analysis and design of concrete steps on how to set up and/or facilitate mobility between third countries and EU Member States;
Support measures during the pre-departure phase, including language training, vocational training, skills enhancement and work-place awareness training;
Support measures during the mobility phase, including further language training in the host Member State, access to cultural mediators, workplace training and mentoring, skills' enhancement and entrepreneurship training.
Support measures during the re-integration phase, including supporting diaspora in enhancing the developmental impact of labour migrants returning to their country of origin, mentoring in association with the relevant local agencies, recruitment to workplace by matching demand-offer skills upon return, as well as support (e.g. provision of advice, coaching) to the setting up of a business in the country of origin.
Outcomes
The projects financed under this priority should achieve the following outcomes:
Development of specific labour and training-related migration projects, involving the actual mobility of the third-country nationals concerned to one or more EU Member States, benefitting the migrant worker, the countries of origin and the (EU) destination country or countries.
Applicants are also invited to take note of, to avoid duplication with, and to build on projects previously funded by the EU in relation to third countries. You may find additional information at:

","single-stage
Deadline date","Scope:
Providing better access to and realising the rights of the victims of trafficking in human beings is a priority under the 2017 Communication on stepping up EU action to address trafficking in human beings.
Data from the EU Member States indicates that around 35 % of victims registered in the EU are non-EU nationals from, amongst others, Nigeria, China, Albania, Vietnam and Morocco. Traffickers are taking advantage of irregular migration routes, and increases have been reported in particular in the number of women and girls trafficked to the EU for the purpose of sexual exploitation from, amongst others: Nigeria, Cameroon, Ghana, Guinea, Côte d’Ivoire and Sierra Leone.
In order to support the integration of third country nationals who are victims of trafficking in human beings, it is important to strengthen relevant stakeholders in implementing the EU Anti-trafficking Directive, with respect to provisions on assistance and support for victims (Art. 11, 13 and 14 of the Directive). At the same time, this contributes to the implementation the 2017 Communication, namely by supporting anti-trafficking objectives and priorities for third country national victims of trafficking through transnational projects. Such projects must ensure that they take into consideration the gender specific nature of this phenomenon as well as the high-risk groups and sectors it affects.
Objectives
Concretely, the objectives of this priority are to:
Improving the integration of third country national victims of trafficking in the host society, taking into account the individual needs of the victims and in view of finding durable solutions and preventing re-trafficking
Facilitating the safe and sustainable, voluntary return of third country national victims of trafficking, with a view to finding durable solutions and preventing their re-trafficking
Ensure durable solutions for third country national child victims of trafficking and prevent re-trafficking
Actions
Measures aiming at improving the early and proactive identification of third country national victims of trafficking in human beings, including enabling them to understand and have access to their rights
Measures aiming at assisting and supporting third country national victims of trafficking and preventing the risk of re-trafficking, catering for the individual needs of the victims
Assistance and support measures taking into account the gender, age and consequences of the form of exploitation victims have been subjected to (amongst others: pregnancy, psychological trauma, physical injuries), including with respect to health and psychological support, aiming at enabling and facilitating the integration of victims in society
Measures directed for the benefit of third country national victims of trafficking, including, amongst others: education, language training, vocational training, apprenticeship programmes; job placement services, skills enhancement, workplace training and mentoring, and entrepreneurship training
Setting up and improvement of transnational cooperation among relevant actors for assisting and supporting third country national victims, aiming at their integration, including in the context of safe and assisted voluntary return when relevant, and implement durable solutions for child victims
Sharing and exchanging experiences, information, knowledge and best practices on integration of third country national victims of trafficking in human beings, for their voluntary and safe return, and for durable solutions for child victims, aiming at achieving concrete impact and benefits on the lives of the victims, in cooperation with relevant authorities and civil society and other actors and disseminate the results
Outcomes
The projects financed under this priority should achieve the following outcomes:
Improve the situation, integration, of third country national victims of trafficking in human beings in cities/regions/rural areas involved in the projects and/or demonstrate and evaluate how the national/transnational actions contributed in this regard
Improve transnational cooperation between local and regional authorities and civil society for the integration, as well as voluntary and safe return of third-country national victims of trafficking and durable solutions for child victims;
Develop practical approaches, tools and guidelines, building on results of past projects when relevant and appropriate.
Project proposals must clearly focus on third country nationals who are victims of trafficking in human beings, and demonstrate how a comprehensive, victim-centred approach will be adopted, concretely presenting the foreseen gender-specific and child-sensitive elements of the implementation at all stages. Project proposals must demonstrate their links with the policy priorities set forth in the 2017 Communication, and take into account the outcomes of the relevant published Studies under the EU Strategy towards the Eradication of trafficking in human beings 2012-2016. In particular project proposals should take into account: Study on Comprehensive Policy Review of anti-trafficking projects funded by the European Commission; Study on High risk groups for trafficking in human beings and Study on gender dimension of trafficking in human beings as well as the 2016 Commission Progress report on trafficking in human beings[1] (Report on the progress made in the fight against trafficking in human beings ('First Progress report') and Commission Staff Working Document accompanying the First Progress report. This includes, but is not limited to, focusing on trafficking for sexual exploitation and especially women and children who are disproportionately affected.
Proposals should be justified taking into account the Communication Reporting on the follow-up to the EU Strategy towards the Eradication of trafficking in human beings and identifying further concrete actions[1] and other documents available on the EU Anti-trafficking website. Creating appropriate links with victims’ countries of origin is not excluded.
Applicants are also invited to take note of, to avoid duplication with, and to build on previous projects:
Comprehensive policy review of EU funded anti-trafficking projects
Past and on-going projects’ descriptions can be found on the EU anti-trafficking website.
In this context, applicants must explain how proposals take note of, and build on, results of existing projects and, where relevant, ensure synergies and complementarities with other programmes implemented in countries of origin and transit in a view to avoiding duplication.

","single-stage
Deadline date","Scope:
According to the Convention on the Rights of the Child, a child should grow up in a family environment, and children who are temporarily deprived of their family environment, including migrant children, are entitled to special protection and assistance.
In line with the requirements of Article 24(2) of the Reception Conditions Directive, unaccompanied children seeking to obtain international protection in the EU must be provided suitable and safe reception conditions, which include placement with a foster family, accommodation centres with special provision for children, or other suitable accommodation, such as supervised independent living arrangements for older children. The UN Guidelines for the Alternative Care of Children constitute relevant standards in this respect.
The Communication on the protection of children in migration identified gaps in the protection offered to migrant children along the entire migratory route, and set out detailed actions to address the gaps identified. The Communication recommended to the Member States to (1) ensure that a range of alternative care options for unaccompanied children are provided; and (2) ensure and monitor the availability and accessibility of a viable range of alternatives to the administrative detention of children in migration. It has also emphasised that there is a wealth of knowledge and good practices in the Member States on the protection of children in migration, including as regards alternative care systems and methods and alternatives to detention, which needs to be shared at local and national level.
Alternative care systems (see article 29 of the of the 2010 UN Guidelines for the alternative care of children), including family-based care, foster care, and supervised independent living arrangements, have expanded in recent years in the EU. Such non-institutionalised systems have proven to be successful, cost-effective, less harmful and more beneficial for the development of the children than institutionalised care. However, family-based care systems are still under-utilised for the migrant children: very often child protection and migration legislation are not aligned, and there is a fragmentation of the relevant procedures among multiple public, private and voluntary bodies. Only a limited number of unaccompanied migrant children have been given access to family-based/foster care, due to an insufficient spread of the knowledge about how to access such systems and of the good practices that exist at local level in different jurisdictions.
Alternatives to the detention of migrant children are foreseen in the legislation of several Member States, yet in practice, the alternatives are either not used or used in a limited way. Furthermore, as flagged in the Communication, in some instances migrant children are detained only due to a shortage of places in suitable and safe accommodation.
In this context, the exchange of good practices and the provision of training on how to access alternative care systems and to support their operation (including by training the families providing the care), and respectively, on the effective use of alternatives to detention, will be highly beneficial.
Objectives
Concretely, the objectives of this priority are to:
Finance projects focusing on the exchange of good practices and/or provision of the necessary training so as to support the implementation/expansion/improvement of alternative care systems (such as family-based care, or foster care, or supervised independent housing arrangements) or of effective alternatives to detention. (Projects with an exclusively national/regional/local focus should seek AMIF funding via the National Programmes, taking account of projects already co-funded in this area.
Actions
Exchange of good practices and/or training and/or logistic support for the implementation/expansion/improvement of alternative care systems for migrant children, such as foster care, family-based care and/or supervised independent living where appropriate.
Exchange of good practices and/or training and/or logistic support for the implementation/expansion/improvement of effective alternatives to detention, such as regular reporting to the authorities (by the appointed representative/family-based care/foster carers), the deposit of a financial guarantee, or an obligation to stay at an assigned place.
Actions that are not eligible for financing under this call are those involving:
Institutionalised care systems
Capacity building for institutional care systems
Operating costs for family-based/foster care systems/supervised independent living/alternatives to detention (such as the cost of staff, buildings, real estate)
Research on foster/family-based/independent living systems or alternatives to detention (there is already ample research available on these subjects – see bibliography below).
Outcomes
The projects financed under this priority should achieve the following outcomes:
Creation/consolidation/expansion and improvement of foster/family-based/independent living alternative care systems that are better adapted to the needs of children and more apt to promote their sound development. Increased/improved use of family-based care/foster care/supervised independent housing for unaccompanied children.
Creation/consolidation/expansion and improvement of effective and viable alternatives to the detention of migrant children, especially when detention is aimed to prevent absconding.
Training and preparation of staff/foster carers/family-based carers for performing all tasks related to promoting the well-being of the children (suitable accommodation, access to basic services and support, pro-integration activities). Preparing the carers for being able to identify and cater for the individual needs of each child and to table a tailored response to meet them.
Exchange of good practices and 'know how' across the Member States, as well as dissemination of the knowledge already accumulated on family-based alternative care systems and alternatives to detention across the national borders and at regional and local levels.
Improved access to of alternative care systems and to effective alternatives to detention for the migrant children, measurable through indicators such as:
o Number of migrant children who will benefit from the projects (Possibly disaggregated by age groups 0-14 and 15-17), and duration (for how long).
o Number of training days that carers benefit from.
o Number of places in alternative care (foster care, family-based care, (semi)-independent living etc.) covered (specifying if new places were created) by the project.
o Number of places in alternatives to detention (specifying if new places were created) covered by the project.
o Description of the services provided to unaccompanied minors (e.g. access to mental health, health and education/vocational training/labour market support) that were improved as a result of the project.
Applicants are also invited to take note of, to avoid duplication with, and to build on previously funded projects:
The 10th European Forum on the rights of the child: the protection of children in migration, held on 29-30 November 2016
The 11th European Forum on the rights of the child: Children deprived of their liberty and alternatives to detention, held on 6-8 November 2017. Under the Rights, Equality and Citizenship Programme, the EU has funded a number of transnational projects aiming at building child protection capacity in the area of alternative care which are also a useful reference for potential applicants for this call.
The Daphne Toolkit
DG Justice Grants
All application under this call should be elaborated in close partnership with and/or be led by appropriate key players (e.g. child protection agencies; ministries/authorities for children or social affairs; social protection; children’s ombudspersons; social services responsible for: housing, labour market integration, higher education and vocational training; health and mental health; counselling and psychosocial support; caregivers' associations, civil society organisations; the judiciary; academia).
At least one public authority from the country/countries where the alternative care or alternatives to detention are implemented must be involved either directly as applicant or co-applicant or indirectly (for example, only as beneficiary of the exchanges of good practices or training). The indirect involvement of the public authority shall be demonstrated at the moment of the signature of the contract through a letter from the public authority confirming its support of the application.
Child protection/safeguarding policy
Where a project involves direct contact with children, the beneficiaries of funding (including partners not directly in contact with children) need to demonstrate in the application that they have set in place an internal child safeguarding policy. An internal child protection policy should include internal standards and rules that cover four broad areas: (1) policy, (2) people, (3) procedures, and (4) accountability.
The continuation or follow-up of successful initiatives, including the scaling up of existing initiatives and/or testing them in a different context, may be funded if it is aligned with the priority. However, the duplication of an initiative will not be funded."

Deadline date","Scope:
The EU Action Plan against migrant smuggling (COM(2015)285) states that raising awareness of the risks of smuggling and of irregular migration is crucial for preventing prospective migrants and asylum seekers, including people in more vulnerable situations such as children, from embarking on hazardous journeys towards the EU. The Action Plan foresees the launch of information and awareness raising campaigns in key countries of origin or transit for migrants. It points to the importance of counter-narrative in the media to oppose misleading information provided by migrant smugglers, including through social media and with the involvement of diaspora communities in the EU.
The objective of the information and awareness raising campaigns and communication activities is to sensitise the target audience and to provide prospective migrants, vulnerable communities, diaspora members and local media with objective information about the perils of migrant smuggling and the legal, social and economic realities of life in Europe, as well as the available legal pathways to Europe. Ultimately, these campaigns seek to enable asylum seekers and migrants to make informed decisions about their movements and plans for the future.
A recent study published by the European Commission showed the important role the Diaspora in conveying messages and information about Europe and migration. Before departure, television influences the aspirations of potential migrants in the country of origin, while word of mouth communication with peers at home and in the diaspora in the EU assists in building plans and encourages moves. Migration plans are often, and perhaps understandably, modelled after the successful journeys of peers already in Europe, and the diaspora continues to be a trusted source of information on the journey. Many migrants seek out new contacts with compatriots based in Europe, predominantly via social media channels.
However, the study has also shown that migrants in the diaspora are unreliable interlocutors. The fast pace of change in transit and destination country policies and contexts, means that the journey and asylum application of one migrant can become unrecognisable just weeks later. Most pertinently, the difficulties irregular migrants face in the host countries are not known by migrants in transit. This seems to indicate that although a great majority of migrants are regularly in contact with the diaspora, they either receive inaccurate information or misinterpret it.
Against this background, the general objective of this action is to engage and empower diaspora communities in EU Member States in raising awareness on the risks of irregular migration and migrant smuggling, and on alternative legal pathways to Europe.
Applications that put forward activities targeting one of the following diasporas will be eligible for this call: Senegal, Gambia, Ghana, Nigeria. Each application shall target a single diaspora community, which should be clearly indicated in the application form.
Objectives
Concretely, the objectives of this priority are to:
Engage with and empower the voice of diaspora communities in the EU in providing information and raising awareness to counter migrant smugglers' narratives on irregular migration and to inform about the opportunities of voluntary return and reintegration programmes
Pilot diaspora-based communication campaigns and activities providing for accurate factual, trusted and balanced information on the risks of irregular migration and migrant smuggling, both during the journey (perils of the voyage when undertaken irregularly) and after arrival (hardships of living irregularly in the EU and return), as well as on alternative legal pathways to Europe
Strengthen multi-stakeholder cooperation between actors such as local governments/councils, civil society organizations, private companies, and where relevant, third countries, on the best ways to engage with diaspora communities as bearers of information to their compatriots planning to come to Europe irregularly
Actions
The following actions and measures may be financed:
Preparatory, fact-funding research to:
o map existing practices, methods and approaches in engaging with diaspora on the topic of prevention of irregular migration and migrant smuggling
o identify the target audience(s), its/their characteristic, motivations, information needs and gaps, and access to media and information sources
o identify communication channels that can be most effectively used by diaspora communities in raising awareness amongst (prospective) irregular migrants in countries of origin or transit
Creation, production, implementation and dissemination of awareness-raising and information campaigns and activities engaging the diaspora communities in the EU, including by partnering with credible diaspora-based social media channels
Monitoring and evaluation of the project to assess its results and to draft recommendations for future engagement with diaspora communities
The involvement of diaspora organisation is key to the successful implementation of this Priority. Applications, which focus only on capacity building for diaspora communities in the EU and in third countries, will not be considered for funding under this call.
Outcomes
The projects financed under this priority should achieve the following outcomes:
Empower the voice of diasporas and strengthen their role as bearers of reliable information for their communities in third countries.
Increase awareness among prospective migrants in origin and transit countries of the risks of irregular migration and migrant smuggling, on alternative legal pathways to Europe as well as about opportunities of voluntary return and reintegration programs

Deadline date","Scope:
Integration in the labour market is a challenge which cannot be tackled by only one actor in isolation. All actors involved must work together to create the conditions for a quick and effective integration of third-country nationals in the labour market. The role of economic and social partners and of public and private employers is key in this area.
In 2017, the Commission launched several initiatives to mobilise economic and social partners and employers to promote labour market integration. On 23 May 2017, at the occasion of the second European Dialogue on Skills and Migration, employers and representatives of economic and social partners discussed the challenges and benefits of the integration of third-country nationals in the labour market and exchanged good practices on how to effectively promote integration [http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-17-1386_en.htm]. On the same day, the initiative ""Employers together for integration"" [https://ec.europa.eu/home-affairs/what-we-do/policies/legal-migration/european-dialogue-skills-and-migration/integration-pact_en] was launched in order to give visibility to the activities put in place by employers to support integration of refugees and other migrants in their workforce and beyond.
In order to continue this process, and considering the different levels of experience and of engagement across the EU on this issue, it is particularly relevant to promote transnational projects and partnerships to foster the integration of third-country nationals in the labour market and to promote employers' and social partners' engagement on this topic.
The objectives are to:
- Promote early and effective integration in the labour market of third-country nationals, by creating effective transnational partnerships with all actors concerned and in particular social and economic partners, employers, public and private employment services and national and local authorities to foster the development of tools, methods, capacity building and experience exchanges;
- Raise awareness about the conditions for early and effective labour market integration of third-country nationals, as well as of its economic and social benefits and mobilise employers and other key actors to become active on this topic.
Projects applications submitted under the present call for proposals under priority 4 should be designed to include in particular one or more of the following activities (non-exhaustive list):
a. Developing measures or design schemes aiming to facilitate the labour market integration of third-country nationals and in particular refugees through, for example:
• the promotion of the use of the EU Skills Profile Tool for Third Country Nationals [http://ec.europa.eu/migrantskills];
• the provision of skills assessment/validation to inform the delivery of tailored learning offers, along the lines of the Upskilling Pathways Council Recommendation [http://ec.europa.eu/social/main.jsp?catId=1224];
• the organisation of mentoring programmes that support third-country nationals to integrate into the workplace and/or support their skills development;
• the provision of pre-recruitment and on-the-job training, including apprenticeships, accelerated training, etc.;
• the provision of information and advice to third-country nationals on rights and duties concerning their access to the labour market and at the workplace, in accordance with national law and practices;
• support to employers in hiring third-country nationals, e.g. through providing training, information on legal framework, support matching etc.;
• the provision of support to trainers in adapting training to refugees’ and other migrants needs, for example in the context of vocational training while taking into account employers’ skills needs;
• the provision of post-placement support to third-country nationals after they start employment, and to their employers, to ensure sustainability of employment;
• the promotion of diversity and non-discrimination at the workplace.
b. Exchanging methods and practices on the different above-mentioned actions and promoting capacity building related to labour market integration of third-country nationals among employers, employers' organisations, chambers of commerce and industries, trade unions and migrants’ associations.
c. Promoting the ""Employers together for integration"" [https://ec.europa.eu/home-affairs/what-we-do/policies/legal-migration/european-dialogue-skills-and-migration/integration-pact_en] initiative and mobilising employers to actively promote integration in their workforce and beyond.
Projects applications that would include at least 3 of the following entities in their applications will be assessed as being particularly relevant:
- European or national associations of employers,
- European, national or regional Chambers of commerce and industry,
- European, national or regional skilled craft Chambers,
- European, national or regional Trade unions organizations
- Vocational education and training providers
- Public or private employment services
- National, regional and local authorities with responsibility for integration into the labour market
Social partners organization (employers or trade union organizations) could be cross-industry or sectoral organizations.
In addition, applicants can include other relevant entities such as non-governmental organisations active in the field of labour market integration.
When proposals aim at reaching out and involving employers, both private and public, a clear and well defined strategy should be included in the proposal (which employers to be involved, kind of activities to be implemented, expected outcomes from the cooperation with them).
Projects will have to represent a clear added value vis-à-vis existing actions and networks which could be active in the same field or target same type of activities.

Deadline date","Scope:
According to the 2016 Report on the progress made in the fight against trafficking in human beings, there is strong evidence that the migration crisis has been exploited by criminal networks involved in trafficking in human beings to target the most vulnerable, in particular women and children. As an example, recent IOM estimates show a sharp increase by 600% since 2014 in the number of potential victims of trafficking for sexual exploitation arriving to Italy through the Central Mediterranean route. Victims are predominantly Nigerian women and girls. In this context, there is a clear need to support the integration of victims of trafficking who are third-country nationals and who are residing legally in a Member State or, where appropriate, who are in the process of acquiring legal residence in a Member State, including beneficiaries of international protection.
The provision of assistance and support for the victims of trafficking in human beings under this call assists the Member States to meet their obligations under Articles 11-14 of Directive 2011/36/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council on preventing and combating trafficking in human beings and protecting its victims[1]. Priority 5 of this call addresses the findings of the Commission Report on the progress made in the fight against trafficking in human beings (2016) as required under Article 20 of Directive 2011/36/EU on preventing and combating trafficking in human beings and protecting its victims and Directive 2011/36/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 5 April 2011 on preventing and combating trafficking in human beings and protecting its victims, and replacing Council Framework Decision 2002/629/JHA [OJ L 101, 15.4.2011, p. 1].
Projects applications submitted under the present call for proposals under priority 5 should be designed to include in particular one or more of the following activities (non-exhaustive list):
1. In the context of delivering individual risk assessments in view of finding durable solutions, actions on assistance and support measures should address the needs of third country nationals, especially women and children, including unaccompanied children, who are victims of trafficking and have specific needs (pregnancy, psychological trauma, physical injuries and age). It is crucial that the measures incorporate a gender-specific approach. Actions should address: support during procedures before national authorities; legal and medical assistance (including psychological support); psychosocial support; accommodation and other relevant assistance and support measures.
2. Actions related to the integration of third country nationals who are victims of trafficking should, in particular, address the perspective of the victims, with a view to assisting their integration in the host society. This should include, but not be limited to, possibilities for education, vocational training and apprenticeship programmes; job placement services; income generating activities; and specialized family or dependant support. A gender-specific approach to such actions is considered important.
Proposals must take a victim-centred approach, and be gender-specific as relevant. Projects should target, but not be limited to, trafficking for the purpose of sexual exploitation as per the results of the Comprehensive Policy Review (see above), the statistical data available (see above), and in line with the decision of the Commission of designating 2017 as the year of focused action to address violence against women and girls [The aforementioned Study found that whilst 14 % and 12 % of funded projects are on sexual exploitation and labour exploitation respectively, 14 % of EC funding is on labour exploitation projects and only 7 % is on sexual exploitation projects. Only between 2-3 % of funded projects are on trafficking of women and children, and trafficking of women.].
The projects under priority 5 must be aiming at achieving one or more of the following outcomes:
Improve the situation of third country national victims of trafficking in human beings and/or demonstrate and evaluate how the national/transnational actions contributed in this regard
Set up and improve transnational cooperation networks for assistance and support of victims and their integration
Share, exchange experiences and information and best practices related to the ground work for integrating victims of trafficking in human beings in cooperation with relevant authorities and civil society and disseminate the results
Develop practical approaches, tools and guidelines.

Deadline date","Scope:
Background
Upon arrival and in the very early stages of the integration process, migrants often encounter difficulties in their social orientation, i.e. in adapting to a new local, social and administrative environment, building a social network, as well as in dealing with authorities, public and private services or handling paperwork. These difficulties can slow down the integration process and affect its outcome. The involvement of the local community can facilitate overcoming these difficulties through, for example, mentoring programmes and/or volunteering activities to provide support to third-country nationals in areas such as knowledge of the new local environment, “ways, customs and habits” of the new society, basic language skills, dealing with administrative procedures in the field of health, housing, education, etc.
Objectives
Develop activities involving local communities, including mentoring and/or volunteering, to facilitate the social orientation and active participation of migrants;
Support the social orientation of both migrant women and men, including through provision of information about all the aspects of daily life;
Strengthen the sense of belonging to the new society and foster an active role in the community at local, regional, national and/or EU level;
Promote meaningful interactions between the local population and newly arrived migrants;
Facilitate the transfer of experience, knowledge and practices between the partners of the project to develop more effective actions;
Facilitate the dissemination of experience, knowledge and practices beyond the partners of the project to develop more effective actions, including by evaluating the impact of the actions developed.
Actions
Activities should aim at facilitating the early integration steps of newly arrived migrants and also foster exchanges between migrants and the receiving society, thus contributing to mutual understanding, knowledge and building of a more cohesive community. Activities should involve the local community (individuals and/or families) and may also support them.
Activities to support the social orientation of newly arrived, through the involvement of local communities including mentoring and/or volunteering activities, designed on an equal basis, for the benefit of all involved. Migrants, especially when already settled in the local community, can also be involved in the activities.
Activities to strengthen the sense of belonging to the new society and foster an active role in the community at local, regional, national and/or EU level;
Activities to promote meaningful interactions between migrants and the receiving society;
Trainings, workshops, mutual learning activities aiming at transferring and sharing knowledge on supporting the social orientation of both women and men newly arrived, strengthening their sense of belonging and promoting exchanges and interactions between the receiving society and migrants facilitating the integration of newcomers as well as developing and sharing the knowledge on how to pursue these objectives in an effective manner, e.g. by evaluating the impact of the actions developed.
The projects and activities need to cover a significant range of relevant areas of daily life for the participants, such as:
everyday problem solving;
access to basic services, including health services and housing;
education and training for children (early care and childhood education, schools, school or pupils’ clubs or events, non-formal education institutions such as youth clubs, sports clubs, or cultural groups for children) and adults (classes, cultural groups);
participation to local community, to social, cultural or sports activities (e.g. taking part, coaching or going to watch), including environmental activities (e.g. national organisations, local conservation groups, preservation societies, local recycling practices).
building a social network and making friends.
The projects and activities need to take into account the specific situation of groups of special concern, such as children, parents with children, women, the elderly, illiterate or semi-literate persons, refugees, people arriving in the context of family migration, or victims of violence who need specific information tailored to their needs.
Outcomes
Improve the social orientation of both women and men newly arrived involved in the projects and/or show and evaluate how the support provided through the project contributed to this objective;
Strengthen the sense of belonging to the new society and support their active role in the community at local, regional, national and/or EU level and/or show and evaluate how the national/transnational actions contributed in this regard;
Promote exchanges and interactions between the receiving society and newly arrived migrants facilitating the integration of newcomers;
Improve transnational cooperation to facilitate the transfer of experience, knowledge and practices (good and bad) related to the social orientation of third-country nationals within the partners of the project, and achieve more effective practices and initiatives;
Facilitate the dissemination of experience, knowledge and practices beyond the partners of the project;
Improve knowledge on how to support the social orientation of both women and men newly arrived;
Improve knowledge on whether and how the facilitation of interactions between the native population and migrants is associated with more positive attitudes towards migrants and improved social integration
Further considerations applicable to this topic
Applicants should consider and clearly detail in their application how the different domains and relevant actors are to be involved. To attain the objectives of this call, it is necessary to:
cover all relevant aspects of daily life across areas such as transport, administrative issues, education, training, counselling, leisure, social networks, well-being and mental health, and
collaborate with all relevant actors (through a “multi-stakeholder approach”), i.e. by developing activities with and engaging various actors, for example: local authorities and communities, private and public stakeholders, educational institutions, non-formal education actors, migrant organisations (including self-led organisations), experienced migrants already living in the host country, social workers, health professionals and above all: migrant women and men and natives who will participate to the project activities.
Furthermore, applicants should also give specific attention to people in a potentially vulnerable situation, including victims of gender-based violence, or who belong to a religious or ethnic minority who could face discrimination or disproportionate obstacles.

Deadline date","Scope:
In May 2015 the European Commission adopted the European Agenda on Migration (EAM), which brings together the different steps the European Union should take now, and in the coming years, to build up a coherent and comprehensive approach to reap the benefits and address the challenges deriving from migration. Building on the European Agenda on Migration and as announced in the Communication of 6 April 2016 on the reform of the common European asylum system and enhancing legal avenues to Europe, the Commission adopted an Action Plan on the integration of third-country nationals on 7 June 2016. The Action Plan is a general policy framework for integration and includes actions to support Member States across all the policy areas that are crucial for integration.
As stressed by the Action Plan on the integration of third-country nationals, the role of local and regional authorities in the integration process is crucial as most of integration measures are implemented at local level. Confronted with several challenges (inter alia lack of experience and knowledge in the field, lack of human and financial resources, political and societal environment not favourable to migrant integration), while facing direct demands to ensure the social and economic well-being of immigrants, the support of the EU can prove essential to help local governments rise to the challenge of integration and contributing to building inclusive and cohesive societies.
Due to the large influx of asylum seekers in 2015 and 2016, local and regional authorities in Europe are now facing several challenges relating to the different areas of integration such as education, housing, integration in the labour market, participation, health, etc. Many cities and regions are confronted with these challenges for the first time, with none or little prior experience in the field. Experience and knowledge on integration varies a lot between Member States and between local and regional authorities within each Member State.
In that respect, a recent study carried out by the OECD on the local integration of migrants and refugees has highlighted the need to share good practices between local authorities. The existing networks involve generally large cities and regions having a long experience on integration. The Commission considers it very valuable to give the possibility to local authorities having less experience in the field, and having been confronted with this issue only recently, to benefit from the knowledge and practices developed by experienced local authorities in that field.
Therefore, in order to promote the exchange of experiences on this topic at EU level, the Commission intends to finance transnational projects setting-up network of regions and cities to work together on integration. These projects, which will be implemented over a relatively long time-scale (up to 3 years), will allow transfer of knowledge, exchange of practices and experiences at local and regional level across Member States.
Partnerships should, in particular, include local and regional authorities having none or little experience on integration and local and regional authorities having experience in that area through the development of integration policies and measures.
The networks funded under this call should aim at exchanging and transferring knowledge and best practices in all relevant areas of integration, and in particular:
Setting-up of local or regional strategies and policies in the field of integration
Setting up of ""one-stop-shop"" structures for integration or local integration centres
Education and training
Housing
Access to basic services, including health services
Integration in the labour market
Promoting active participation and social inclusion
Favouring exchanges between migrants and the host society as well as raise awareness on the benefits of integration
Considering the potential EU added value of large networks, projects involving more Member States than the minimum number identified in the eligibility criteria (see section 5.2.) would be particularly welcome.
Objectives
Concretely, the objectives of this priority are to:
Facilitate the transfer of experience and knowledge on integration between local and regional authorities at EU level through setting up networks of local and regional authorities at EU level
In the context of the network, develop concrete projects and activities on integration at local or regional level (particularly in the areas indicated above), for which a support by a local or regional authority having experience on similar project might be useful, especially in the setting–up and the development of the first phase
With the support of the network, promote exchanges, between the host society and migrants on the topic of integration
Facilitate the dissemination of know-how and best practices beyond the partners of the network.
Although the networks should be mostly made of local and regional authorities where relevant and useful for the implementation of the projects and activities the partnerships could also involve NGOs, social and economic partners, employers as well as national authorities.
Actions
Trainings, workshops, mutual learning activities aiming at transferring and sharing knowledge on integration
Technical assistance from members of the network for setting up and implementing projects to local and regional authorities in the field of integration
Transfer of knowledge between members of the network, implementation of projects in the field of integration
Awareness raising activities and events organised at local level to facilitate integration (e.g. presenting success stories of integration, fighting prejudices).
Create tools or platforms to facilitate the dissemination of know-how and best practices
Outcomes
The projects financed under this priority should achieve the following outcomes:
Improve transnational cooperation between local and regional authorities for the integration of third-country nationals;
Improve the situation and integration of third country nationals in cities/regions involved in the projects and/or demonstrate and evaluate how the national/transnational actions contributed in this regard;
Share and exchange experiences, information and best practices on integration at local level;
Develop and implement concrete integration projects and measures at local level following the exchange of information and experience between members of the network
Applicants are also invited to take note of, to avoid duplication with, and to build on projects previously funded by the EU in relation to legal integration. You may find additional information at:

Background
As part of the EU efforts to provide more legal channels for the growing number of displaced persons in need of international protection, the European Commission[1] invited Member States to explore ways to establish private sponsorship schemes where civil society organisations provide support for the settlement and integration for persons in need of protection. In line with the conclusions of a study recently carried out for the European Commission[2] on private sponsorship, the European Commission proposes to provide funding for fostering the integration of persons in need of protection through private sponsorship schemes.
The concept of private sponsorship is not clearly and easily defined. The above-mentioned study identified a wide range of definitions of private sponsorship and an equally varied array of practices. The number of different sponsorship schemes has proliferated across the EU and they have a wide variety of characteristics in the eligibility criteria of the sponsor and beneficiary, responsibilities of the sponsor, and in the status granted and associated rights. Private sponsorship schemes implemented to date in Europe can be divided into four main categories: humanitarian corridors; ad-hoc schemes for specific religious groups; specific family reunification schemes; and community-based sponsorship. Given the diverse range of admission schemes that have operated in Member States with a sponsorship component, sponsorship is best described as a way of admitting persons for humanitarian reasons, rather than as a separate channel itself. Private sponsorship schemes share one common characteristic: they involve a transfer of responsibility from government agencies to private actors for some elements of the identification, pre-departure, reception, or integration process of beneficiaries. With a strong involvement of local communities and civil society organisations, these schemes allow strengthened capacities at local level to provide adequate support for integration and usually lead to better integration outcomes of the persons concerned.
The use of private sponsorship is expanding within the territory of the European Union, and over the period 2013-2018 the number of persons admitted under private sponsorship in the EU exceeded 30,000, with over three quarters admitted by Germany alone (the other Member States include the United Kingdom, Portugal, Italy, Ireland, France, Czech Republic, Slovak Republic, Poland, and Belgium).
This Topic focuses on one of the key objectives of private sponsorship schemes: enabling better integration prospects for private sponsorship beneficiaries.
Objectives
The objectives of this Topic are to support transnational projects that:
In Member States that operate private sponsorship schemes, provide support and enhance capacity building for sponsor organisations, including new sponsor organisations, and their members (individual mentors), which take part in private sponsorship schemes and are entrusted with facilitating the integration of the beneficiaries of such schemes;
In Member States that do not yet operate private sponsorship schemes, support the design and implementation of pilot schemes on private sponsorship.
Proposals should indicate whether they relate to objective a) or b) mentioned above.
Actions:
Technical assistance, trainings, workshops, mutual learning activities aiming at transferring and sharing knowledge on successful refugee integration through private sponsorship schemes between experienced and new sponsor organisations;
Create tools or platforms to facilitate the implementation of private sponsorship and the dissemination of know-how and best practices among sponsor organisations;
For proposals relating to objective B only: Providing technical, legal and operational support for designing and implementing a private sponsorship pilot project in a Member State that does not yet operate private sponsorship schemes, aiming at successful integration outcomes for the beneficiaries. Such support may include actions related to the development of an agreement with the Member State’s authorities in charge, the selection of the beneficiaries and of the sponsor, the preparation of the departure of third-country nationals to that Member State, their transfer and their integration measures at arrival and afterwards, as well as monitoring and evaluation of the private sponsorship scheme.
Outcomes
Achieving more efficient private sponsorship schemes with better integration situation for their beneficiaries through capacity building and peer learning across borders.
For proposals relating to objective A only: Scaling up existing private sponsorship schemes through capacity building and peer learning across borders – and potentially new sponsor organisations.
Involving more Member States in private sponsorship through promoting pilot schemes in close cooperation between the Member States and sponsor organisations.
Successful integration situation through well trained and informed sponsor organisations and individual mentors, aware of the roles and responsibilities entailed in private sponsorship;
Improved transnational cooperation on private sponsorship schemes between experienced and new sponsor organisations;
Improved private sponsorship schemes following the exchange of information and experience between organisations participating to the project;
Improved knowledge on the impact of private sponsorship on the integration of third-country nationals (especially in comparison with the situation of third-country nationals not benefitting from private sponsorship schemes);
Best practices on private sponsorship schemes shared and peer learning facilitated;
For proposals relating to objective B only: New private sponsorship pilot schemes created in Member States that have so far not been engaged in private sponsorship.
Further considerations applicable to this topic
Future projects should take into account the work to be undertaken by EASO building on their first pilot project on private sponsorship programmes which started in December 2017.
In case proposals address objective (b) above (i.e. supporting the design and implementation of new pilot schemes on private sponsorship), their focus should not be only on pre-departure measures. Proposals submitted under this objective by a NGO or international organisation as lead applicant/coordinator should involve directly (as member of the consortium) or indirectly Member State’s authorities concerned.
Given the potential overlap with AMIF-2019-AG-CALL-02 in relation to integration measures through involvement of local communities (see below), potential applicants should take into account the specificities of AMIF-2019-AG-CALL-01, which focuses only on integration of persons in need of protection through (existing or to be developed) private sponsorship schemes, while AMIF-2019-AG-CALL-02 relates to third-country nationals in general.
The Commission would welcome large or small projects in terms of budget and number of partners. The Commission considers also valuable that organisations representing migrants are involved in the project.
Moreover, the Commission considers positively that applicants build on the experience of private sponsorship already in place in other countries, for example through mutual learning activities, including from some organisations based in non-EU countries, such as Switzerland and Canada, given the relevant experience in terms of resettlement and private sponsorship.
Applicants are also invited to take note of, to avoid duplication with, and to build on projects previously funded by the EU in relation to integration and to take into account the study on the feasibility and added-value of sponsorship schemes as a possible pathway to safe channels for admission to the EU, including resettlement[3].

Background
In the area of asylum and migration, the national administrations of EU Member States are confronted with a wide range of different tasks and activities requiring high level of expertise. Continued training and learning opportunities for personnel are key to strengthen their knowledge and skills and ensure they will perform their job at a satisfactory level. Enhanced quality within the Member States’ national asylum and migration services also contributes to the effective implementation of the Common European Asylum System.
With regard to the asylum procedure, for example, Member States shall ensure that the personnel of the national authorities that receive applications for international protection or are responsible for their examination have the appropriate knowledge and receive the necessary appropriate training. In this respect, Member States shall take into account the relevant training established and developed by the European Asylum Support Office (EASO)[1].
In accordance with its mandate[2], EASO supports practical cooperation among Member States, including by establishing and developing training opportunities available to members of national administrations and national authorities responsible for asylum and reception matters. EASO’s Training and Learning Strategy contributes to strengthen the implementation of the Common European Asylum System, mainly through three categories of programs: the Training Curriculum (which covers core aspects of the asylum procedure through interactive models), the Operational Training (to support Member States subject to particular pressure on their asylum and reception systems) and other relevant training initiatives, such as the development of specific training resources.
Information about the training and learning activities of EASO is available on EASO’s website at: https://easo.europa.eu/training-quality.
Objectives
This topic aims at supporting transnational projects that foster practical cooperation among national authorities responsible for asylum and migration matters from EU Member States, which, in the framework of the implementation of the Common European Asylum System, have similar specific training/learning needs or wish to exchange practices and experiences on training initiatives.
Funded projects should liaise with EASO at all the appropriate levels to ensure complementarity and consistency with EASO’s Training and Learning Strategy and its training modules and tools.
Actions
- Mapping of current training and learning needs of personnel dealing with asylum and reception related matters, within Member States’ national asylum and reception administrations, courts and tribunals, national services which are not entirely covered by EASO training and learning activities. The mapping should take into consideration the European Sectoral Qualification Framework for asylum and reception officials developed by EASO;
- Identification of future training and learning needs within the context of continuing professional development in Member States’ national asylum and reception administrations and courts and tribunals;
- Exploring /identifying tailored solutions for induction training, relevant for personnel not having deep knowledge/skills on asylum and reception matters within Member States’ national administrations, with a view to complement the operational training provided by EASO in view of their potential deployment on the ground.
Outcomes
Analysis of training and learning needs and other carried out activities;
enhanced cooperation on training activities in the area of asylum and reception among EU Member States;
promotion of high quality training and learning standards in the practical implementation of the Common European Asylum System.

Background
Providing better access to and realising the rights of the victims of trafficking in human beings is a priority under the 2017 Communication ‘Reporting on the follow-up to the EU Strategy towards the eradication of trafficking in human beings and identifying further concrete actions[1] (‘2017 Communication’). The European Commission has been supporting transnational projects contributing to the early identification, assistance, support, referral and integration of third country national victims of trafficking in human beings. Ensuring that funding matches anti-trafficking policy aims is a cross cutting priority of the 2017 Communication.
The European Commission second progress report (2018)[2] indicates that Member States reported on victims of trafficking found in asylum application systems; on organised criminal groups abusing asylum procedures. In this respect, Europol[3] has warned that ‘OCGs involved in trafficking in human beings also continue to exploit asylum provisions in order to traffic non-EU nationals into the EU. In many occasions, victims are provided with fraudulent documents to conceal their real identity and age’. EU Member States and other sources[4] reported concerns on criminal networks involved in trafficking in human beings taking advantage of the irregular migration routes. In the report, the European Commission notes that trafficking in human beings should be addressed in the context of migration, taking into account the disproportionate targeting of women and girls trafficked for the purpose of sexual exploitation. Efforts should continue to ensure that all victims are identified and provided with assistance and protection appropriate to their gender, age and the form of exploitation. Data from EU Member States for years 2015-2016[5] indicate that 56% of registered victims of trafficking in human beings within the EU are non-EU citizens,. Non-EU citizen victims of trafficking in human beings are exploited for sexual (51%) purposes, for labour (32%) or for other (17%) purposes. Females were over three quarters of the victims among non-EU citizens (76%). Girls were over half (54%) of victims within non-EU citizenship.
Based on the 2017 Communication, and on the findings and identified patterns of the European Commission second progress report, which includes information from the member states, relevant EU Agencies, civil society and relevant reports by international organisations[6], this topic aims at strengthening relevant stakeholders in transnational context with regard to the implementation of the EU Anti-trafficking Directive.
Objectives
Transnational proposals should aim to contribute to the objectives of the 2017 Communication and ensure that they take into consideration the findings and identified patterns highlighted in the European Commission Second progress report[2] (2018) and accompanying Staff Working Document[8], and the Study on data collection on trafficking in human beings in the EU,[5] in particular trafficking for sexual exploitation as well as the high-risk groups and high risk sectors concerned.
Concretely, the objectives of this topic are to:
Facilitate the early identification of third country national victims of trafficking in human beings including in the context of asylum procedures
Provide assistance and support to victims of trafficking in human beings, taking into account the specific needs of the victims; these should be appropriate for victims’ age, sex and specific consequences of the form of exploitation they have been subjected to;
Facilitate the integration of third country national victims of trafficking in the host society, taking into account the individual needs of the victims and in view of finding durable solutions and preventing re-trafficking
Facilitate the safe and sustainable voluntary return of third country national victims of trafficking, ensuring appropriate risk assessment and with a view to finding durable solutions and preventing their re-trafficking
Ensure durable solutions for third country national child victims of trafficking and prevent re-trafficking.
Actions
Concrete transnational assistance and support measures taking into account the sex and age of the victims and consequences of the form of exploitation they have been subjected to (amongst others: pregnancy, psychological trauma, physical injuries), including with respect to health and psychological support, aiming at enabling and facilitating the integration of victims in society.
Concrete measures directed for the benefit of third country national victims of trafficking, including, amongst others: education, language training, vocational training, apprenticeship programmes; job placement services, skills enhancement, workplace training and mentoring, and entrepreneurship training.
Initiatives for setting up and improvement of transnational cooperation among relevant actors for:
the early identification, assistance, support of third country national victims of trafficking in human beings, for their integration, and within the context of their safe and assisted voluntary return when relevant and in this context to facilitate exchanges of experiences and best practices
facilitating and implementing durable solutions for child victims; and in this context to facilitate exchanges of experiences and best practices.
Sharing and exchanging experiences, information, knowledge and best practices on integration of third country national victims of trafficking in human beings, for their voluntary and safe return, and for durable solutions for child victims, aiming at achieving concrete impact and benefits on the lives of the victims, in cooperation with relevant authorities and civil society and other actors and disseminate the results.
Outcomes
The projects financed under this topic should achieve the following outcomes:
Improved identification, situation, integration of third country national victims of trafficking in human beings in cities/regions/rural areas and in high risk sectors involved in the projects and demonstrate how transnational action contribute in this regard;
Improved transnational cooperation between local and regional authorities and civil society for the identification, integration, as well as voluntary and safe return of third-country national victims of trafficking and for finding durable solutions for child victims;
Develop practical approaches, tools and guidelines, by building on results of past projects when relevant and appropriate.
Further considerations applicable to this topic
Project proposals must clearly focus on third country nationals who are victims of trafficking in human beings. Proposals should demonstrate how a comprehensive, victim-centred approach will be adopted, concretely presenting the foreseen gender-specific and child-sensitive elements of the implementation at all stages (from project design in line with the EU legal and policy framework via the different project activities and in the final outcome and/or impact as relevant).
Project proposals must demonstrate their links with the policy priorities set forth in the 2017 Communication ‘Reporting on the follow-up to the EU Strategy towards the Eradication of trafficking in human beings and identifying further concrete actions’, and take into account the outcomes of the relevant published Studies under the EU Strategy towards the Eradication of trafficking in human beings 2012-2016 as well as the 2016 Commission Progress report on trafficking in human beings and the 2018 Commission Progress report and other documents relevant in the context[10]
Creating appropriate links with victims’ countries of origin is not excluded.
Applicants are invited to take note of, to avoid duplications with and to build on projects previously funded by the EU in relation to trafficking in human beings, on which information is available:
Study on Comprehensive policy review of EU funded anti-trafficking projects[11]
Past and on-going projects’ descriptions can be found on EC anti-trafficking website.
In this context, applicants must explain how proposals take note of, and build on, results of existing projects and, where relevant, ensure synergies and complementarities with other programmes implemented in countries of origin and transit in a view to avoiding duplication.
This topic aims to fund targeted, practical projects ensuring maximum tangible and demonstrable benefits and impacts. The projects should demonstrate a sound methodology and practical implementation measures and outcomes. Activities such as background research and the mapping of existing materials should be very minor components of applications and where they are included a solid justification is needed, unless clearly indicated otherwise. This is not a topic aiming for enhancing the capacity to collect, analyse and disseminate detailed data and statistics; however it is expected that available data is used to justify the need for the foreseen action and as to the impact of the project.
Any training and/or practical tools should have as an overarching objective to make the system work better to improve positive impact on the lives of the victims. Applications should include a clear sustainability plan to ensure that the results of the project are useful in the longer term and after the end of the funding. In this context, applicants are invited to take note of previously funded projects in that area.
The above-mentioned aspects will be taken into account when evaluating the applications.

Background
Migrant children continue to arrive to the EU in relatively large numbers. From the 34,376 irregular migrants who arrived to the EU by land or sea or land in the first half of 2019, 23% are children.[1] According to EASO, in 2018, children lodged 159,000 asylum applications in the EU+.[2] The number of unaccompanied migrant children arriving to the EU frontline Member States is notable: in Spain, 13,500 estimated to be present on the territory at the end of 2018, in Italy 8,500, and in Greece 3,700.
The 2017 Communication on the protection of children in migration[3] is still actual. The Communication identified serious gaps in the protection offered to migrant children in different areas, and set out recommendations on how to address the gaps identified. The Communication had highlighted the need to provide adequate reception and support to the migrant children, including in terms of accommodation, access to basic services, and specialised support for the most vulnerable, and the negative impact that detention measures may have on children, especially when detention is the consequence of an irregular migration status. The Communication thus recommended to work towards ensuring the availability of alternative care systems and of effective alternatives to administrative detention on migration grounds.
According to the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child (‘UNCRC’), a child should grow up in a family environment, and children temporarily deprived of their family environment, including migrant children, are entitled to special protection and assistance. In line with the requirements of Art. 24(2) of the Reception Conditions Directive (2013/33/EU), unaccompanied children seeking to obtain international protection in the EU must be provided suitable and safe reception conditions, which include placement with a foster family, accommodation centres with special provision for children, or other suitable accommodation, such as supervised independent living arrangements for older children. The UN Guidelines for the Alternative Care of Children (2010) constitute relevant standards in this respect.[4]
The notion of “alternative care” in this context is not only about offering suitable accommodation outside the traditional reception institutions, but also about providing suitable assistance to the children - which should be tailored to their individual needs, besides facilitating access to education and healthcare.
Nowadays there is consensus amongst EU stakeholders that well-managed alternative care systems are more beneficial to the well-being and harmonious development of the unaccompanied migrant children. Notably so, alternative care systems are also less costly than institutional reception facilities. Yet, for a variety of reasons – of legal, cultural, socio-economic nature - at present only a small number of unaccompanied and separated migrant children arriving to the EU have the opportunity to benefit from quality alternative care, while the majority are still placed in institutional reception facilities. Nonetheless, there is a growing wealth of knowledge and expertise on how to provide quality alternative care, which needs however to be shared and spread across the Member States.
Alternatives to the detention of migrant children are foreseen by the legislation of several Member States, yet in practice, the alternatives are either not used or used in a limited way. Furthermore, as flagged in the Communication, in some instances migrant children are being detained only due to a shortage of places in suitable and safe accommodation.
The 2018 AMIF Call for Proposals has already proposed as a priority to finance projects facilitating the exchange of good practices and the provision of training on how to access alternative care systems and to support their operation (including by training the families providing the care), and respectively, on the effective use of alternatives to detention. In view of the importance and topicality of the two subjects – i.e., alternative care systems and alternatives to detention, the present Call shall continue the financing of projects on the same subjects.
Objectives
Concretely, the objective of this topic is to fund :
Projects focusing on the exchange of good practices and/or the provision of the necessary training across the Member States so as to support the implementation/expansion/improvement of alternative/non-institutionalised care systems for the migrant children (such as family-based care, or foster care, or supervised independent housing arrangements, etc.) and/or of effective alternatives to the detention of children on grounds related to migration.
Actions
Exchange of good practices and/or training and/or provision of logistic support for the implementation/expansion/improvement of alternative care systems for migrant children, such as foster care, family-based care and/or supervised independent living where appropriate.
Exchange of good practices and/or provision of training and/or logistic support for the implementation/expansion/improvement of effective alternatives to detention, such as regular reporting to the authorities (by the appointed representative/family-based care/foster carers), the deposit of a financial guarantee, or an obligation to stay at an assigned place.
This topic does not aim to fund applications with an exclusive national/regional/local focus [5] and applications involving :
Institutionalised care systems
Capacity-building for institutional care systems
Operating costs for family-based/foster care systems/supervised independent living/alternatives to detention (such as the cost of hiring staff, rental of buildings, purchase of real estate etc.)
Research on foster/family-based/independent living systems or alternatives to detention (there is already ample research available on these subjects – see bibliography below).
Outcomes
The projects financed under this topic should achieve the following outcomes:
Creation/consolidation/expansion/improvement of foster/family-based/independent living alternative care systems that are better adapted to the needs of children and more apt to promote their sound development. Increased/improved use of family-based care/foster care/supervised independent housing for unaccompanied children.
Creation/consolidation/expansion/improvement of effective and viable alternatives to the detention of migrant children, especially when detention is aimed to prevent absconding.
Training and preparation of staff/foster carers/family-based carers for performing all tasks related to promoting the well-being of the children (suitable accommodation, access to basic services and support, pro-integration activities). Preparing the carers for being able to identify and cater for the individual needs of each child and to table a tailored response to meet them.
Exchange of good practices and 'know how' across the Member States, as well as dissemination of the knowledge already accumulated on family-based alternative care systems and alternatives to detention across the national borders and at regional and local levels.
Improved access to alternative care systems and/or to effective alternatives to detention for the migrant children, measurable through indicators such as:
Number of migrant children who will benefit from the projects (Possibly disaggregated by age groups 0-14 and 15-17), and duration (for how long).
Number of training days that carers benefit from.
Number of places in alternative care (foster care, family-based care, (semi)-independent living etc.) covered (specifying if new places were created) by the project.
Number of places in alternatives to detention (specifying if new places were created) covered by the project.
Description of the services provided to unaccompanied minors (e.g. access to mental health, health and education/vocational training/labour market support) that were improved as a result of the project.
Further considerations applicable to this topic
To avoid duplication, applicants are also invited to take note of and to avoid duplication with, and to build on previously funded projects, such as the following:
The 10th European Forum on the rights of the child: the protection of children in migration, held on 29-30 November 2016.
The 11th European Forum on the rights of the child: Children deprived of their liberty and alternatives to detention, held on 6-8 November 2017. Under the Rights, Equality and Citizenship Programme, the EU has funded a number of transnational projects aiming at building child protection capacity in the area of alternative care[6] which are also a useful reference for potential applicants for this call.
The 12th European Forum on the Rights of the Child – and in particular the Workshop on the protection of children in migration.
The Daphne Toolkit
DG Justice Grants
Projects financed by DG JUSTICE on the rights of the child
DG HOME Funded projects under the 2018 AMIF Call
Applications for this topic should be elaborated in close partnership with and/or be led by appropriate key players (e.g. child protection agencies; ministries/authorities for children or social affairs; social protection; children’s ombudspersons; social services responsible for: housing, labour market integration, higher education and vocational training; health and mental health; counselling and psychosocial support; caregivers' associations, civil society organisations; the judiciary; academia).
At least one public authority from the country/countries where the alternative care or alternatives to detention are implemented must be involved either directly as applicant or co-applicant or indirectly (for example, only as beneficiary of the exchanges of good practices or training).
The continuation or follow-up of successful initiatives, including the scaling up of existing initiatives and/or testing them in a different context, may be funded if it is aligned with the topic. However, the duplication of an already-implemented initiative without adding new elements will not be funded.

Background
Women can be crucial facilitators in the integration process. When they have children, they are often multipliers in the areas of education and employment and play an important role as agents for the transfer of values. The positive impact of migrant women’ employment on the social outcomes of their children is well documented.[1]
Still, data and research show that migrant women face multiple disadvantages in comparison with migrant men and native-born women; in particular they have lower activity and employment rates, a higher risk of poverty or social exclusion and are more likely to be in lower skilled/valued occupations.[2] This is true even though migrant women have on average a similar, or slightly better, level of education than migrant men. More adverse integration outcomes in turn can undermine their personal as well as economic independence, increase the risk of vulnerability and social isolation, as well as the risk of suffering mental health issues and low self-esteem. Women perceived as Muslim or of African descent face particular difficulties, in particular due to discrimination in access to the labour market.[3]
Therefore, it is essential to support migrant women and girls to participate in all spheres of society and to promote gender equality. An effective social integration of women in the receiving society, in particular the capacity to interact and feel at ease with the new social environment, can contribute to improved social cohesion and facilitate their integration in the labour market.
Research carried out by the OECD and evaluations of previous AMIF projects supporting migrant women allow drawing some elements that contribute to the success of projects. Availability of childcare, even if informal, during the activities enhances the participation of migrant women. Confidence building, especially for new arrivals, is key and can be provided in a variety of ways, including mentoring schemes or engaging with participants and their families. Experienced migrant women already well established in a community can play a role, for example as mentors, facilitators, or role models.
Objectives
Support the economic and social integration of migrant women; more specifically:
support the capacity of migrant women to interact and feel at ease in their social environment and their participation to social and political life at local level and/ or
support migrant women moving into work and facilitate their sustainable labour market integration.
In addition, the projects should:
raise awareness among migrant women of their rights, including access to education and work, participation in social, economic and cultural life, protection against gender based violence and access to justice;
raise awareness among public officials and professionals of specific needs and situation of migrant women in access to services;
facilitate the transfer of experience, knowledge and practices within the partners of the project to develop effective actions;
facilitate the dissemination of experience, knowledge and practices beyond the partners of the project, in particular at local and regional level, to develop more effective action targeting migrant women, including those from vulnerable groups;
improve knowledge on how to better support the social and economic integration of migrant women.
Actions
Activities for migrant women co-designed with them to best meet their needs, and designed in a flexible way to facilitate continued participation.[4]
Practical trainings, workshops, mutual learning activities, mentoring schemes, peer group activities aiming at improving social and economic integration of migrant women and transferring and sharing knowledge on successful approaches to support the integration of women.
Outreach and empowering of particularly vulnerable groups of migrant women, for example women with low educational attainment, with limited or no work experience and paying specific attention to how several forms of discrimination can reinforce each other and affect migrant women.
Activities to support integration into the labour market of migrant women should be developed to fit local labour market needs and explore less traditional job opportunities. They should also be organised in places easily accessible by migrant women, in particular by public transport. Linking work experience with training and language learning (for example half day each) is beneficial, as well as migrant women participation in activities lasting at least 6 months.
Examples of activities could include:
Specific language and orientation courses, in particular actions mixing language classes with other activities to consolidate language acquisition and improve other skills, competences or work experiences, such as vocational training or volunteering activities;
Activities developing job-related skills and competences, preparing for entry into labour market, (e.g. by providing support in drafting CVs and preparing for a job interview, helping in developing social and professional networks), upskilling or specific actions to support that skills and qualifications of women are properly assessed, validated and recognised; labour market integration measures specifically geared towards women;
Activities fostering confidence building and improving self-esteem, advancing social, political, cultural and/or sport participation;
Activities mixing local and migrant population to increase knowledge and awareness;
Activities tackling gender stereotypes and developing specific support programmes for migrant women;
Trainings for professionals and public officials working with migrant women / involved in the elaboration and implementation of integration programmes and activities to sensitise them to issues of gender equality and particular needs of migrant women.
Outcomes
Increased capacity of migrant women to interact and feel at ease in their social environment and to participate to social and political life at local level;
improved preparation of migrant women for entering labour market and active social participation;
improved independence and self-esteem of migrant women;
better level of knowledge of women rights, increasing migrant women self-confidence, opening of horizons of participating women on how they see their role in society;
better understanding by professionals and public official working with migrant women of their specific needs and gender issues.
Further considerations applicable to this topic
Applicants should consider and clearly detail it in their application how various policy areas and actors are to be involved. To attain the objective of this topic, it is necessary to build collaboration with and engage various actors (through a “multi-stakeholder approach”), such as local authorities and communities, private and public stakeholders, educational institutions, non-formal education actors, civil society organisations including migrant-led organisations, experienced migrant women living already in the host country for a longer time, social workers, health professionals. Migrant women – main target group of this topic - need to be directly involved in the design and implementation of the actions. The project proposals should specify the design/ methods of such involvement.
Migrant women are the target group. Migrant men may also be included in some specific activities, to raise the awareness of content and purpose of the activities and support the continued participation by migrant women in the activities and enhance the understanding of Union values of equality and in particular equality between women and men, and attitudes to gender equality.[5]
Furthermore, applicants should also consider specific attention to migrant women in a potentially vulnerable situation, including victims of gender-based violence, or who belong to a religious or ethnic minority who could face discrimination or disproportionate obstacles.
The Commission would welcome the diversity of large or small projects in terms of budget and number of partners. The Commission considers also valuable that migrant organisations are involved in the projects, be it as applicant, co-applicant or in a different way.
The Commission considers it valuable to give the possibility to organisations having less experience in the field of integration or having been confronted with this issue only recently, to benefit from the knowledge and practices developed by experienced organisations in that field. Partnerships should, where possible, include organisations having little experience on integration and organisations having experience in that area through the development of integration policies and measures.
Applicants are also invited to take note of, to avoid duplication with, and to build on projects previously funded by the EU in relation to integration. Applicants may find additional information and useful documents at:

[2]A number of factors may explain gender differences in outcomes: education level and sills, reason for migration (in particular family versus other categories), proficiency in host-country language, access to integration programmes, access to social support (employment services, childcare) and gender stereotypes. Those who come to the EU for family reasons do not always benefit from integration programmes, skills assessment, re-training and other activation measures available for other immigrants and therefore face large obstacles to overcome their social isolation and integrate in the labour market.

Background
The EU Action plan against migrant smuggling (COM(2015)285)[1] states that raising awareness of the risks of smuggling and irregular migration is crucial for preventing prospective migrants and asylum seekers, including people in more vulnerable situations such as children, from embarking on hazardous journeys towards the EU. To this end, the Action Plan foresees the launch of information and awareness raising campaigns in key countries of origin or transit for migrants. It points to the importance of creating a counter-narrative in the media to oppose misleading information provided by migrant smugglers, including through social media and with the involvement of diaspora communities in the EU.
The Asylum, Migration and Integration Fund has already awarded several grants for information and awareness raising activities following previous Calls for Proposals. In 2018, following the Call for Proposals AMIF-2017-AG-INFO, six projects have been awarded and are being implemented in third countries of origin and transit of irregular migration. The grants to be awarded following the AMIF-2018-AG-INTE-05 Call for Proposals are engaging and empowering the voice of diaspora communities within the EU to provide information and raise awareness to counter migrant smugglers' narratives for prospective migrant in third countries. This Call for Proposals aims to build on the results and expertise gathered over the last few years, in order to improve effectiveness of outreach to the target audiences.
The decision to embark on an irregular journey to Europe is often characterised by the fact of overlooking the risks for the potential reward. Potential migrants might either overestimate the likelihood of a successful outcome, fail to make a conscious assessment based on evidence or disregard the likely risks altogether. Shortcomings in past information and awareness raising activities have often pointed to the following:
Few potential migrants receive information or consider it useful;
Migrants did not trust certain information channels and while there was an abundance of reporting on the migratory situation, resorting to and trusting reliable news and information was still scarce;
Negative information presented in campaigns was either not believed, or was insufficient to overcome the appeal of the alternative positive information presented by friends, family or smugglers;
Some migrants chose to disregard the information presented, as they felt that they had no other choice than to migrate.
A recent study published by the European Commission[2] as well as analysis done for the Dutch Ministry of Justice and Security[3], the implementation of communication campaigns with components targeted at origin, transit and destination countries could influence and reduce irregular migrant flows to Europe. The key challenge is in delivering this information through sources the target audience trusts. It also finds that communication campaigns should consider the following elements for better outcomes:
The need to separate the sources of information that influence and encourage the aspiration to migrate from the sources of information that lead to departure, and determine the smuggling process and route;
The need to address aspirations to migrate irregularly, by seeking to counterbalance the not always realistic views of Europe;
The need to engage more directly in the migrants' decision-making process by providing timely information, which would help migrants assess properly the likely rewards of risky behaviour, rather than just focusing on the risks themselves;
The need to use communication channels tailored to the specific groups of the target audience (e.g. internet, television, social media, print etc.);
The need to nuance communication targeting migrants in transit, by helping them to assess and weigh up the known costs of remaining or the stigma around the ‘failure’ of being returned on the one hand, against the unknown risks, costs and/or rewards of migrating irregularly onwards to Europe on the other hand;
The need to work with communities in countries of origin to soften the stigma of return, to change perspectives on returnees and to support the re-integration processes and reconciliation with families;
The role of network connections, such as family and friends in the transit or destination country in determining destination choices, for both regular and irregular migration journeys.
The general objective of the information and awareness raising campaigns is to communicate objective information about the perils and difficulties of voyages and about the legal, social and economic realities of life in Europe, to prospective migrants, vulnerable communities, diaspora members and local media outlets. Ultimately, these campaigns should enable asylum seekers and migrants to make informed decisions about their movements and plans for the future. In addition, information campaigns should also emphasise the option/alternative of voluntarily returning to countries of origin for those not in need of international protection, who feel their expectations do not match the reality either on route or in Europe.
Objectives
This topic aims at funding projects of information and awareness raising campaigns in the area of migration in the following third countries: Algeria, Morocco, Senegal, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kosovo[4], Montenegro, North Macedonia, Serbia (with a focus on preventing irregular migration and, in particular, migrant smuggling, as defined in the AMIF work programme for 2019. The campaigns in third countries may be complemented by components in Europe that focus on engaging the target audiences’ network connections.
The general objective of this topic is to contribute to the change of perceptions and behaviour of third country nationals pondering irregularly migrating to the EU and key influencers of their decisions.
The goal of this topic is to support actions that pursue the following specific objectives:
to provide trusted, factual, balanced information on the risks of irregular migration – during the journey (dangers of migrating irregularly) and after arrival (hardship of living in the EU irregularly and return), as well as on relevant legal alternatives of migration and on available economic opportunities in the country or region of origin;
to empower credible voices in countering migrant smugglers' narratives on irregular migration and the diasporas' narratives on living irregularly in the EU;
to strengthen multi-stakeholder cooperation between actors such as civil society organisations, researchers, media outlets, local state actors, diaspora and where relevant other stakeholders;
to enhance the sustainability of communication activities and results of the campaign.
Project proposals submitted under this topic should build on the lessons learnt from the past and on-going information and awareness raising campaigns and activities in the area of preventing irregular migration and migrant smuggling, including those implemented by the EU, Member States and International Organisations. The projects should seek synergies with ongoing communication activities being implemented under actions funded by the EU, such as the relevant projects co-funded by AMIF[5], and projects funded by the EU Trust Fund for Africa, as well as, where relevant, with those implemented by EU Member States, International Organisations and other partners.
Each project proposal should target a single third country, unless the target communities are established in or transiting across several countries. The reasons behind these choices should be clearly explained and justified in the application.
This topic does not aim to fund information and awareness raising campaigns targeting only diaspora within EU Member States and lacking engagement with third country stakeholders.
Actions
Project proposals should include all the following components:
Preparatory research, in view of developing a tailored communication strategy for the project, in particular to identify the migration context, target audience(s) of the communication activities, its (their) characteristics, motivations, information needs and gaps as well as communication channels and tools, as to design the most effective approach to influence its (their) behaviour. The preparatory research should also rely on results and lessons learnt from previous campaigns and communication activities carried out in the same country and should use available primary and secondary data and own analysis.
A tailored communication strategy based on the outcome of the preparatory research, in particular to define:
the target audience and its segmentation (gender, age, education, profession, etc.);
the geographical scope of the campaign based on the target audience identified (which country/region and which part of that country in particular) and the specific migratory context (country of origin vs transit or destination);
a comprehensive concept, including the overarching idea for the campaign structure, the key messages to be used throughout the period of implementation of the activities and the key visual elements;
a creative approach allowing for participation and feedback from the target audience, e.g. by fostering use of smartphone apps and text messaging for both multiplication and monitoring/feedback purposes;
the communication channels to be used depending on the target audience, ensuring a mix of traditional and social media, including media-buying plan where appropriate, as well as local or community level outreach, and taking into account the habits of each segment of the target audience in terms of media access and consumption as well as access and use of trusted information;
alternative communication tools where appropriate, such as theatre plays, community-led debates, contests (e.g. photo, song, video) and awards (e.g. for journalists), school visits, testimonials, involvement of celebrities etc., adapting them to the habits and characteristics of each context and segment of the target audience;
detailed plan for the roll-out and management of the campaign;
key performance indicators (KPIs), both qualitative and quantitative, with baseline and targets to be used to monitor the implementation and to assess the result of the campaign from the outset.
The production and implementation of the communication campaign, in particular:
pre-testing of concepts and content of the campaign on sample/focus groups of identified target audience;
production of content of the campaign;
rolling-out of the communication activities;
Monitoring and evaluation of the results and impact of the campaign, in particular:
collecting and analysing of the key performance indicators (KPIs) defined in the communication strategy;
providing for adjustments of the on-going campaign if necessary;
allowing for lessons learnt and good practices for future campaigns;
A strategy for the sustainability of the campaign activities, in particular:
engaging with state and non-state actors, throughout the campaign, with a view to sharing know-how and best practices, raising their awareness and building ownership;
Further considerations applicable to this topic
The campaigns should seek to directly address both prospective migrants and their key influencers, such as families, religious or community leaders, teachers, diaspora in main countries of transit and destination, returning migrants, social contacts, providers of services facilitating migration, etc.
To ensure the viability of the campaigns, applicants should organise consultations with relevant authorities of the country subject of the proposal throughout the different phases of the project (conception, implementation, evaluation and sustainability).
Applicants should develop country-specific and audience-tailored messages for the proposed campaign. However, these messages should in general address the following:
Irregular migration often entails unbearable physical and mental suffering along the journey, as a consequence of engaging with and being misled by migrant smugglers. The risks for children, especially unaccompanied, and for women are particularly high;
The cost of migration is often much higher than expected and often leads to loss of money and accumulation of debts which are not compensated for upon arrival (if arrived at all);
Those who enter the EU irregularly and are not in need of protection will be returned; voluntary returns is possible from transit countries;
While success stories are possible, living in the EU irregularly is very often much harder than expected; diaspora may depict a bright scenario, ashamed to unveil the hardships faced in reality;
If relevant, communicate the legal pathways that exist for both those who migrate for work/education and for those who seek protection;
Alternatives to migration exist in countries of origin or neighbouring countries/region and are supported financially by the EU and EU Member States that help to build the local economy and address the root causes of irregular migration;
Soften the stigma of return in countries of origin, to change perspectives on returnees and to promote success stories of re-integration support and reconciliation with families;
Given the significance of behavioural change in the context of information and awareness raising campaigns, insights from psychology, sociology and behavioural economics could help to target and design communication activities and to measure their effects. Behavioural sciences seek to understand how people make decisions in practice; how their behaviour is influenced by the context in which their decisions are made and how they are likely to respond to specific policy initiatives. Applicants are encouraged to embed a behavioural approach to their proposals by:
identifying the potential behavioural element (i.e. the cause) of the action;
proposing behavioural levers that can be used to induce behavioural change (e.g. by adapting content of messages, using reference to social norms, addressing misconceptions, raising knowledge, acting upon individual responsibility, perceived norms and loss aversion, framing of the message or adapting the source of the message);
introducing behavioural element as an indicator for measuring the expected and actual impact of the initiatives.
The projects should lead to the following key deliverables for the corresponding components:
report from the targeted preparatory research carried out in order to develop the tailored communication strategy;
tailored communication strategy document, including definition of the geographical scope (e.g. if target communities established or transiting across several countries), audience segmentation, selection of topics and messages, plan for the use of tailored media and alternative communication channels, detailed plan for the roll-out of the campaign, etc.;
monitoring and evaluation methodology document[6], including credible baseline and targets for key performance indicators (KPIs) for all elements of the campaign covering inputs, outputs, outcomes and impact of the communication activities;
content of the information and awareness raising campaign, including products and services designed, produced and disseminated during the campaign;
quarterly monitoring reports, including on implementation, contingencies and adjustment measures and progress towards achieving the proposed key performance indicators;
a mid-term progress report using the standard form that will be available on the Participant Portal;
a final report including the results, as well as the observations from the monitoring and evaluation of the project.
Outcomes
The projects financed under this topic should achieve the following outcomes:
Increased awareness among prospective migrants on the risks of irregular migration and migrant smuggling, the relevant legal alternatives of migration and economic opportunities in the country or region of origin; as well as opportunities of voluntary return and reintegration programs from countries of transit;
empower credible voices in countering migrant smugglers' narratives on irregular migration and the diasporas' narratives on living irregularly in the EU;
strengthen multi-stakeholder cooperation between actors such as civil society organisations, researchers, media outlets, local state actors, diaspora and where relevant other stakeholders;
enhance the sustainability of communication activities and provide a sound evaluation of results of the campaign.

Background
One of the priorities under the 2017 Communication ”Reporting on the follow-up to the EU Strategy towards the eradication of trafficking in human beings and identifying further concrete actions”[1] (”2017 Communication”) is to provide better access to and realise the rights of the victims of trafficking in human beings. Ensuring that funding matches anti-trafficking policy is a cross-cutting priority, taking particular account of the gender dimension of the phenomenon, high-risk groups, as well as high-risk sectors.
Victims of trafficking in human beings are found in asylum application systems and organised criminal groups abuse asylum procedures, notably ”to legalise both theirs and their victims’ status”[2]. Other documents relevant in that context should also be considered, such as reports published by the EU agencies, in particular those addressing trafficking for sexual exploitation, as well as the high-risk groups and sectors concerned[3]. These reports include Frontex Risk Analysis 2018[4], Europol 2018 report on child trafficking[5], Fundamental Rights Agency 2019 guide to enhance child protection focusing on victims of trafficking[6], European Institute for Gender Equality (EIGE) 2018 report on Gender-specific measures in anti-trafficking actions[7].
The outcomes and findings of the upcoming European Commission Third progress report, the results of the latest EU-wide data collection, as well as the Study on Reviewing the Functioning of National and Transnational Referral Mechanisms, which is one of the key actions of the 2017 Communication (all expected to be published in last quarter of 2020) are also relevant for the objectives of this topic.
COVID-19 pandemic has created challenges affecting disproportionately the most vulnerable. The crisis has exacerbated people’s vulnerability to trafficking in human beings, including women and children[8].
Objectives
Under the EU legal and policy framework addressing trafficking in human beings, this topic aims at strengthening the actions of relevant stakeholders in the context of the implementation of the EU Anti-trafficking Directive[9].
Consequently, the topic aims to contribute to the enhanced integration of the third-country nationals (TCN) victims of trafficking in human beings and to the objectives of the 2017 Communication and particularly to the following ones:
Facilitating the early identification of third-country national victims of trafficking in human beings, including in the context of asylum procedures;
Providing appropriate assistance and support to victims of trafficking in human beings considering their specific needs based on their personal circumstances and such as their age and sex, and the physical and psychological consequences of the form/s of exploitation they have been subjected to;
Facilitating durable solutions for the integration of third-country national victims of trafficking, including children, in the host society, that take into account the individual needs of the victims and prevent re-trafficking;
Facilitating durable solutions for the safe and sustainable voluntary return of third-country national victims of trafficking that build upon appropriate risk assessments and prevent their re-trafficking.
In the context of theCOVID-19 pandemic, the proposals should duly take into account the impact of the pandemic on the integration of TCN victims of trafficking in human beings, including in relation to their early identification, assistance and support, especially in relation to the special needs of the victims.
The main objective of this topic does not include undertaking research as a key action.
Actions
Actions are expected to be justified in relation to the integration of TCN victims of trafficking in human beings.
Concrete transnational assistance and support measures, including with respect to health and psychological support, to victims of trafficking in human beings, taking into account their personal circumstances such as whether they are pregnant, their health status, their sex, age or a disability that they may have, as well as the physical or psychological consequences of the form of exploitation they have been subjected to (e.g. pregnancy, psychological trauma, physical injuries), while aiming at enabling and facilitating their integration in the host society.
As part of the abovementioned transnational assistance and support measures, actions can include more specific measures directed for the benefit of TCN victims of trafficking, including, amongst others: education, language training, vocational training, apprenticeship programmes; job placement services, skills enhancement, workplace training and mentoring, and entrepreneurship training.
Initiatives for setting up and improving transnational cooperation by facilitating exchanges of experiences and best practices among relevant actors, such as law enforcement, judiciary, immigration and asylum authorities, civil society organisations and other services, or international organisations for:
The early identification, assistance, support of thirdcountry national victims of trafficking in human beings, for their integration, and within the context of their safe and assisted voluntary return when relevant;
Facilitating and implementing durable solutions for child victims.
Sharing and exchanging experiences, information, knowledge and best practices on integration of TCN victims of trafficking in human beings and disseminate the results.
Taking into account the challenges in responding to the Covid-19 pandemic and its impact on the assistance, support and integration of TCN victims of trafficking in human beings, actions can include initiatives via online or other technological means, to the extent that they contribute to the objectives of the call.
Proposals should clearly focus on TCNs who are victims of trafficking in human beings[10].
Proposals should demonstrate how a comprehensive, victim-centred approach will be adopted, concretely presenting the foreseen gender-specific and child-sensitive elements of the implementation at all stages (from project design in line with the EU legal and policy framework via the different project activities and in the final outcome and/or impact as relevant).
Proposals should demonstrate a sound methodology and practical implementation measures.
Activities such as background research and the mapping of existing materials should be very minor components of the proposals and where they are included a solid justification is needed, unless clearly indicated otherwise.
As this topic does not aim to enhance the capacity to collect, analyse and disseminate detailed data and statistics, the scope of data collection should be limited to the sole purpose of justifying the need for the foreseen actions and presenting the expected impact of the project.
Any training and/or practical tools should have as an overarching objective to make the system work better to improve positive impact on the lives of the victims.
Whenever relevant, proposals can include the creation of links with victims’ countries of origin, with a view for example to facilitate durable solutions for the safe and sustainable voluntary return of TCN victims of trafficking and prevent their re-trafficking.
Outcomes
Proposals should focus on contributing to the achievement of the following outcomes:
Improved identification, situation and integration of TCN victims of trafficking in human beings in those contexts, e.g. cities/regions/rural areas, and high-risk sectors, such as agriculture and hospitality, addressed by the proposal;
Improved transnational cooperation between local and regional authorities and civil society for the identification, integration, as well as voluntary and safe return of third-country national victims of trafficking and for finding durable solutions for child victims;
Developing practical approaches, tools and guidelines, by building on results of past projects when relevant and appropriate.
Further considerations applicable to this topic
This topic aims to fund targeted, practical projects ensuring maximum tangible and demonstrable benefits and impacts, including aiming at achieving concrete and direct impact and benefits on the lives of the victims, in cooperation with relevant authorities and civil society and other actors.
Proposals are expected to take into account the results of previously EU funded projects in relation to trafficking in human beings, such as those for which information is available:
Study on Comprehensive policy review of EU funded anti-trafficking projects;
Past and ongoing projects’ descriptions can be found on EC anti-trafficking website.
Where relevant proposals should ensure synergies and complementarities with other programmes implemented in countries of origin and transit in a view to avoiding duplication.

[2]https://www.europol.europa.eu/publications-documents/emsc-4th-annual-activity-report-–-2019 . In this respect, Europol has warned that ”OCGs involved in trafficking in human beings also continue to exploit asylum provisions in order to traffic non-EU nationals into the EU. In many occasions, victims are provided with fraudulent documents to conceal their real identity and age”. EU Member States and other sources reported concerns on criminal networks involved in trafficking in human beings taking advantage of the irregular migration routes. Trafficking in human beings in the context of migration needs to take into account the disproportionate targeting of women and girls trafficked for the purpose of sexual exploitation. Efforts should continue to ensure that all victims of trafficking in human beings are identified and provided with assistance and protection appropriate to their gender, age and the form of exploitation they are subjected to.
Proposals under this topic should take into account and explain their relevance in relation to the outcomes of relevant findings in documents published in connection with the EU Strategy towards the Eradication of trafficking in human beings 2012-2016 and the 2017 Commission Communication[[In particular, project proposals should take into account: Study on Comprehensive Policy Review of anti- trafficking projects funded by the European Commission (2016), available at: https://ec.europa.eu/antitrafficking/sites/antitrafficking/files/study_on_comprehensive_policy_review.pdf; Study on High risk groups for trafficking in human beings (2015), available at: https://ec.europa.eu/anti-trafficking/eu-policy/study-high-riskgroups-trafficking-human-beings_en; Study on gender dimension of trafficking in human beings (2016), available at: https://ec.europa.eu/anti-trafficking/eu-policy/study-gender-dimension-trafficking-human-beings_en; EU Anti-trafficking Action 2012-2016 at a glance, https://ec.europa.eu/anti-trafficking/sites/antitrafficking/files/eu_anti-trafficking_action_20122016_at_a_glance.pdf and EU Anti-trafficking action 2017-2019 at a glance, https://ec.europa.eu/anti-trafficking/sites/antitrafficking/files/eu_anti-trafficking_action_2017-2019_at_a_glance.pdf; COM(2018) 777 final and SWD(2018) 473 final, https://ec.europa.eu/home-affairs/sites/homeaffairs/files/what-we-do/policies/european-agenda-security/20181204_com-2018-777-report_en.pdf and Study on Data collection on trafficking in human beings in the European Union (2018) https://ec.europa.eu/home-affairs/sites/homeaffairs/files/what-we-do/policies/european-agendasecurity/20181204_data-collection-study.pdf

Background
Integration is a multi-sectoral issue that requires the mobilisation of many stakeholders encompassing different aspects of society. The coordination and timely intervention of these stakeholders is key for an early start of the integration process, as well as for its success. As integration takes place mostly at local level, it is particularly important to coordinate the interventions of different stakeholders through locally focused strategies and plans. The development and implementation of these strategies and of related actions should be based on a comprehensive and integrated approach. It should also encompass an effective consultation and cooperation involving third-country nationals (TCNs) wherever possible, in order to take into account their views and experiences.
In this context, the European Commission has already put in place the Urban Agenda Partnership[1] on the inclusion of migrants and refugees, an innovative multi-level governance platform between cities, national governments and the European Commission, as well as the Urban Academy on Integration, which promotes learning and exchanges between cities, regions and national authorities[2].
Under the 2018 AMIF work programme, the European Commission has also funded eight projects promoting the swift integration of migrants through local and regional networks exchanging knowledge and best practices in all relevant areas of integration[3]. Moreover, other transnational AMIF projects have developed local integration strategies, including in cities, which lacked experience in this area[4].
Objectives
The objective of the topic is to facilitate the development and implementation of multi-stakeholder local integration strategies encompassing different aspects of the integration process. Consequently, proposals should aim at improving socio-economic inclusion and sense of belonging for migrants in local communities. Moreover, as the exchange of good practices and knowledge across the EU serves these particular objectives, proposals that include improving transnational cooperation between relevant stakeholders in the development and implementation of local integration strategies are encouraged.
Actions
Local integration strategies can be developed by local authorities in urban or suburban areas, small towns or rural areas.
The scope of the local integration strategies should be defined on the basis of and taking into account the local needs, context and administrative structure of communities.
Regarding their content, the local integration strategies do not need to cover all aspects relevant to a comprehensive integration policy; however, they should provide for a relevant local integration framework to tackle pertinent integration challenges, such as housing, integration in the labour market, exchanges between newcomers and the local population, sport and culture.
The proposals should include one or more of the following actions (non-exhaustive list):
Consultation activities for the design of the local integration strategy;
Trainings, workshops and mutual learning activities;
Technical assistance and peer review from members of the partnership for setting up and implementing a local integration strategy;
Transfer of knowledge activities between members of the partnership;
Awareness raising activities and events;
Creation of tools or platforms to facilitate the dissemination of know-how and best practices.
Proposals may include other actions beyond those listed above; however, they should clearly demonstrate how actions would serve to achieve the objectives outlined above.
Development of the strategies and implementation of the related actions should be based on a comprehensive approach through effective consultation and cooperation with relevant stakeholders, such as local and regional authorities, national public authorities, economic and social partners, employers, social economy actors and civil society organisations, including migrant associations and local communities for the benefit of their views and experiences.
It is not required that all actions foreseen in the local integration strategy are implemented during the lifetime of the project, however, proposals should implement some of them.
Outcomes
Proposals should focus on contributing to the achievement of the following outcomes:
Established sustainable framework at local level for discussion on the development and the implementation of a local integration strategy;
Replicable good practices and a methodology for the development and implementation of a local integration strategy that can inspire other local actors across the EU;
Improved transnational cooperation between active stakeholders in local integration strategy;
Improved socio-economic inclusion and a sense of community at a local level for migrants involved in the project;
Increased exchange of experiences, information and best practices on integration at local level;
Concrete integration projects and measures implemented at a local level as a result of the exchange of information and experiences between partners of the project.

The European Commission would welcome proposals involving applicants from more Member States than the minimum number identified in the eligibility criteria.
The European Commission would welcome proposals with broad geographical scope engaging applicants from diverse regions across the EU.
The proposed consortium should directly involve local and regional authorities as applicants or co-applicants.
The consortium should include relevant key partners such as local and regional authorities, national public authorities, economic and social partners, employers, social economy actors, and civil society organisations, including migrant associations and local communities.
Proposals should devote specific attention to migrant women and children, especially of those in potentially vulnerable situations, as well as to members of religious or ethnic minorities who could face discrimination or disproportionate obstacles to societal integration.

Background
The large number of arrivals of people seeking international protection in the European Union in 2015–2016 led many EU Member States to implement new or enhanced measures for the integration of asylum seekers and beneficiaries of international protection. In this emergency context, the integration measures in most Member States focused on ensuring that basic needs would be met in an unfamiliar country, with an emphasis on language learning and access to employment. Few Member States developed integration measures covering the full social and economic inclusion of all their residents[1]. In this regard, there is still a need to facilitate and provide access to basic services for TCNs, in order to encourage further integration and inclusion. These services should ideally be offered in a “mainstreaming approach” so that migrants can fully access the benefits provided by other social policies, which they would be entitled to.
The inability to communicate effectively in a host country’s language can impede access to services and achieving long-term integration. National government authorities are aware of the importance of supporting language learning, but in many countries there is a clear drop-off in support for intermediate and advanced courses. It is therefore crucial to provide adequate language learning possibilities at various levels for TCNs in order to facilitate their integration into all aspects of society, local labour markets and education systems.
Although language learning for primary and secondary school children is usually provided by their host country in order to permit children to integrate into the school system, further language training for young adults is often not provided. Language courses at various levels, including intermediate (B1-B2) and advanced (C1-C2) levels according to the Common European Framework for Languages[[https://www.coe.int/en/web/common-european-framework-reference-languages/level-descriptions, would be necessary in order to allow adult TCNs, who have not been through the local school system, to access vocational and higher education programmes.
While TCNs generally have access to mainstream public employment services, availability of other services or vocational training opportunities that are tailored specifically to the needs of TCNs are not always ensured throughout the EU. Moreover, it would be useful to promote financial inclusion and literacy of TCNs in order to facilitate their access to financial services, including digital banking, mortgages, loans and investments. Access to health care and housing also requires more attention from policy-makers. To counter the lack of social housing in some countries, specific initiatives should be put into place in order to assist TCNs in finding proper and affordable accommodation.
The global COVID-19 pandemic has disproportionately affected vulnerable communities, including TCNs across the EU[[Analysis on Covid-19’s impact of migrant communities published in EWSI (https://ec.europa.eu/migrant-integration/news/covid-19s-impact-on-migrant-communities).. Health care systems have been overstretched and in many cases, TCNs did not receive proper support nor relevant information in their native language.
Intercultural competence in health care systems is increasingly recognised as an essential element of adequate health care provision. In a majority of countries, it is possible for TCNs to obtain interpretation or cultural mediation services (including via telephone or video), but only a handful of countries make these types of services widely available.
Finally, interpreting services should be of high professional level (both linguistically and ethically) in order to provide sufficient support to TCNs in accessing health care, housing and social service sectors. Currently, interpreters and cultural mediators are not always trained by institutions specialised in interpreting training, providing internationally accepted qualification recognised by professional organisations. Sometimes interpreters do not have any training at all, are trained on the spot or follow short courses organised by NGOs. This results in an unequal quality of interpreting, which can be harmful to both the beneficiary and the provider of the public service involved. Therefore, there is a need to provide systematic and professional training to public service interpreters provided by recognised institutions, based on a framework of minimum standards.
Objectives
The objective of this topic is to improve access to basic services for TCNs, by identifying and reducing obstacles to access services in one or several of the following areas:
Health care, including mental health, psychological support, COVID-19 related information and support,
Labour market, especially access to public employment services and to vocational training,
Social security benefits,
Housing,
Financial literacy and access to financial services,
Continuous education from primary to tertiary levels.
In particular the aim is to improve the quality and availability of information on accessing these services, the capacity of service providers to deal with TCNs, addressing language, cultural and other possible barriers in accessing these services. Consequently, proposals should include a “multi-stakeholder approach” and ensure the involvement of the relevant actors.
Actions
Actions funded under this topic can focus on providing one specific basic service or on a transversal approach to accessing the basic services referred to in the previous section.
Actions can also include the organisation of trainings, conferences, webinars as well as mapping and research.
Proposals should include one or more of the following actions (non-exhaustive list):
The development and testing of local one-stop-shops to provide information and orientation to a wide range of services, e.g. housing, health care, education, etc.;
Mechanisms and/or structures to provide effective access to a specific service, such as health care, education, social housing, provision of training for staff in contact with TCNs, e.g. doctors, nurses, teachers, social assistants, interpreters, and administrative staff;
Setup of cooperation amongst relevant actors relating to innovative tools and/or methods to provide mental health and psychological support to TCNs, especially victims of violence, trauma and/or torture;
Preparation and provision of adequate language and support courses for TCNs who have the necessary qualifications to access vocational or higher education programmes;
Support to access to housing through information mechanisms regarding available properties and mediation between TCNs and landlords to facilitate access to housing, especially concerning private housing, which can supplement social housing if shortages occur;
Actions relating to financial literacy of TCNs and facilitating access to financial services such as creating awareness raising campaigns, organizing trainings, simplifying procedures to open digital accounts and providing incentives for migrants to use digital mediums;
Preparation and provisions of adequate trainings by qualified institutions for interpreters involved in supporting access to basic services for TCNs;
Support capacity building for service providers on intercultural competences;
Promote Public Service Interpreting standard setting, as well as training of interpreters involved in supporting access to basic services for TCNs by qualified institutions;
Support teacher training for TCNs in order to broaden their competencies in dealing with migrant children while streamlining language learning for TCNs and enhancing teachers’ competences;
Set up language learning programmes tailored to the learners’ needs in communicative competence.
Proposals may include other actions beyond those listed above; however, they should clearly demonstrate how actions would serve to achieve the objectives outlined above.
Actions can target TCNs in general or focus on specific groups, such as migrant women, children and/or specifically vulnerable migrants.
The proposed actions should employ a “multi-stakeholder approach” ensuring the involvement of relevant actors, such as public authorities (local, regional or national), economic and social partners, employers, service providers in the relevant areas, e.g. health care, housing, and financial services, civil society organisations, including migrant associations and local communities in the design and implementation of the proposed actions. Applicants should consider and clearly detail in their application how the different domains and relevant actors are to be involved.
Outcomes
Proposals should focus on contributing to the achievement of the following outcomes:
Develop approaches to facilitate access to basic services that can be adapted to local contexts;
Mapping of obstacles to basic services for TCNs, including main obstacles preventing access to basic services;
Improved access to comprehensive health care services for TCNs including mental health, women and children's health, taking into account cultural differences;
Improved access to social security benefits for TCNs as well as to services facilitating labour market integration;
Improved access to financial services for TCNs;
Improved access to housing for TCNs by supporting them in their housing queries and helping to provide them with affordable accommodation based on their needs;
Improved access to education for TCNs at all levels from primary to tertiary;
Replicable methodology/projects/tools:
Improved access to health care services, housing, education, financial services, social welfare rights and/or labour market;
Improved coordination between relevant stakeholders;
Improved transnational coordination and cooperation between the relevant stakeholders following the implementation of the projects’ actions;
Increased awareness of the obstacles faced by TCNs to access those services and the possible solutions by relevant actors across the EU.
Further considerations applicable to this topic
The European Commission would welcome proposals involving applicants from more Member States than the minimum number identified in the eligibility criteria.
The European Commission would welcome proposals with broad geographical scope engaging applicants from diverse regions across the EU.
The proposed consortium should include key actors for the achievement of the proposed objectives, such as public authorities (local, regional and/or national), economic and social partners, employers, service providers in the relevant areas, health care, housing, financial services, etc. civil society organisations, including migrant associations and local communities.
Proposals should also ensure specific attention to migrant women and children, especially if in potentially vulnerable situations as well as to members of religious or ethnic minority who could face discrimination or other disproportionate obstacles to societal integration.

In spite of substantial progress made, many discrepancies still exist across EU Member States concerning the access to basic services for third-country nationals (TCNs). As access to these services, such as health, housing and education, is a prerequisite for TCNs integration, this subject was identified as a priority under the 2016 Action Plan on integration of third-country nationals[[COM(2016) 377, Action Plan on the integration of third-country nationals, https://ec.europa.eu/home-affairs/sites/homeaffairs/files/what-we-do/policies/european-agenda-migration/proposal-implementation-package/docs/20160607/communication_action_plan_integration_third-country_nationals_en.pdf"

Background
The UNHCR estimates that 1.44 million refugees worldwide will be in need of resettlement in 2021. Resettlement places are crucial for vulnerable refugees. The European Commission along with many governments and international organisations recognise the need to increase their resettlement numbers both at the EU level and globally. Nevertheless, current resettlement numbers remain limited worldwide. Only 57 500 places were available in 2020 worldwide, of which almost 30 000 were pledged by EU Member States. Considering the increasing need for durable solutions, it is essential to provide, in addition to resettlement, safe and legal pathways to the EU for people in need of protection.
At the international level, the New York Declaration for Refugees and Migrants, adopted at the General Assembly of the United Nations on 19 September 2016, and the Global Compact for Refugees, adopted in December 2018, called for expanding legal pathways for refugees so that they can become systemic and globally available. The UNHCR Three-Year Strategy (2019-2021) on Resettlement and Complementary Pathways has set ambitious goals to develop complementary pathways in addition to resettlement.
Complementary pathways cover a wide range of programmes that all aim to provide safe and legal admission and lawful stay in any EU Member State for people in need of international protection, taking into account their specific needs and in some cases their skills and competences.
Complementary pathways can be implemented through making existing legal migration channels more accessible to people in need of protection by building on their motivations and talents. They can help families to reunite with their close family members and facilitate labour mobility and student admissions to universities in the EU for people in need of protection.
To develop complementary pathways, NGOs, the private sector and international organisations need to cooperate closely with national authorities of the Member States to make existing legal migration channels more accessible to people in need of international protection. They are also called upon to develop new, innovative humanitarian admission programmes that create additional places for vulnerable refugees.
Swift integration of newcomers into host societies is essential to make complementary pathways a success for all. All relevant stakeholders must work together to achieve this objective. In that respect, community sponsorship models are particularly valuable.
Objectives
The objective of the topic is to lead to the creation of new places for legal admission and an effective integration of people in need of international protection by designing and implementing complementary pathway programmes which would:
Facilitate their enrolment in European universities;
Facilitate access to work-related residence permits for individuals with relevant skills for the EU labour market;
Enable legal and safe family reunification for the beneficiaries of international protection residing in the EU by providing assistance and support;
Promote new initiatives or improve existing ones led by locally-established actors in the receiving country, e.g. civil society organisations, diaspora communities, local authorities, etc. carried out in cooperation with relevant authorities to establish community sponsorship programmes for the purpose of humanitarian admission and other complementary pathways.
The Commission would particularly welcome proposals that design and implement new programmes. Proposals that significantly expand the scope and number of places available under already existing programmes and building on the lessons learned of the initial programme will also be welcome.
Actions
Proposals should include one or more of the following actions (non-exhaustive list):
Activities to address the barriers to legal pathways for people in need of international protection
The development of programmes for the admission and subsequent integration of people in need of international protection in the Member States, including through tailor-made pre-departure and post-arrival measures;
Activities to mobilise local support and build strong partnerships between key stakeholders, such as national and local authorities, local communities, employers, unions, higher education institutions, students, diasporas and other private sponsors.
Taking into account the transnational aspect of the topic, actions should also foster joint activities between partners in different Member States, such as:
Activities to enable peer to peer learning between Member States building on the knowledge of experienced Member States using online activities to limit costs,
Activities to develop or adapt common tools and guidebooks taking into consideration existing material;
Activities to foster joint actions in the country of first asylum where people in need of international protection are identified to benefit from the programme, such as joint outreach activities and common information sessions about legal pathways opportunities;
Activities to develop a transnational European network of practitioners.
To ensure the feasibility of their proposals, applicants should consult relevant national authorities at the proposal preparation stage and report on the results of this consultation process accordingly in their proposals.
Proposals are recommended to involve people in need of international protection in the design, implementation and evaluation of the programme.
Outcomes
Proposals should focus on contributing to the achievement of the following outcomes:
Higher number of people in need of international protection benefiting from a complementary pathway to the EU and benefiting from pre-departure assistance and post-arrival integration measures;
Strengthened support at the local and national level for the development of complementary pathways, particularly though building effective partnerships between relevant stakeholders;
Enhanced dissemination and exchange of experiences, knowledge and practices on complementary pathway programmes across the EU, though the creation of networks where feasible.
Further considerations applicable to this topic
The European Commission would welcome proposals involving applicants from more Member States than the minimum number identified in the eligibility criteria.
The European Commission would welcome proposals with broad geographical scope engaging applicants from diverse regions across the EU.
The proposed consortium should include relevant key partners for the achievement of the proposed objectives such as academic institutions, the private sector, civil society organisations, economic and social partners, international organisations and diaspora communities.
Proposals should describe how they started to engage with relevant public authorities in the Member States concerned in order to gain their support for planned actions. The direct involvement of relevant Member States’ authorities concerned as applicants or co-applicants would be particularly favoured.
Proposals should ensure specific attention to women in need of international protection, especially those in potentially vulnerable situations."

Background
In recent years, the European Commission has opened a space for discussion and consultation of civil society organisations, in particular through the European Migration Forum, as part of the increasing importance of open and inclusive policy and law-making.
Building on the pilot action “European Migrant Advisory Board” (2018-19)[1], the Directorate-General for Migration and Home Affairs of the European Commission set up a European Commission expert group on the views of migrants to advise the European Commission on policies in the field of migration, asylum and integration of migrants[2].
The European Commission Action Plan on the integration of third-country nationals from 2016[3] stresses that the involvement of third-country nationals (TCNs) in the design and implementation of integration policies is essential to improve their participation and their integration outcomes.
Indeed, increasing refugee and migrant participation in the design and implementation of integration policies is crucial for developing effective policies that are tailored to the needs of its main beneficiaries. Actively involving migrants, asylum applicants and refugees and promoting their participation in consultative and decision-making processes that concern them, can contribute to their empowerment and long-term integration into society.
It is thus clear that there is a need to support the establishment of structured and formalised ways to consult migrants regularly on policies that directly concern them. In recent years, consultative bodies of migrants at local, regional and national level have been established in several Member States; even so, important differences in the degree of direct involvement of migrants in the definition and implementation of integration policies still exist across the EU. In some Member States, migrants are involved in the design of migration, asylum and integration policies through consultative bodies at local, regional and national level, while in other Member States formal ways to consult them are still lacking. Therefore, cooperation between countries with different levels of experience can be particularly effective in this area. Furthermore, promoting the active participation of migrants in consultative and decision-making processes can contribute to their empowerment and long-term integration into society.
Objectives
The objective of this topic is to promote refugee and migrant participation in the design and implementation of integration and related policies at local, regional, national and European level.
Actions
Proposals should include one or more of the following actions (non-exhaustive list):
Support the setting up of councils or consultative bodies of migrants at local, regional, national and EU level in close cooperation with public authorities;
Develop innovative consultation mechanisms for migrants in policy areas that concern their inclusion and participation in host societies, e.g. education, health care, employment, housing;
Promote the exchange of experiences between local, regional and/or national public authorities about the involvement of migrants in the design of integration policies and their implementation;
Enhance capacity building for public authorities at local, regional or national level for efficiently consulting and involving migrants in the design and implementation of policy areas that directly affect them.
Proposals may include other actions beyond those listed above; however, they should clearly demonstrate how actions would serve to achieve the objective outlined above.
Outcomes
Proposals should focus on contributing to the achievement of the following outcomes:
Increased participation of migrants in decision-making processes at local, regional, national and European level in the field of integration or in policy areas that are particularly relevant for integration, e.g. education, health care, employment, housing;
Increased involvement of migrants in the implementation of policies in the field of integration or in policy areas that are particularly relevant for integration, e.g. education, health care, employment, housing, etc. at the local, regional and/or national level;
Increased capacity of local, regional and/or national authorities to effectively consult migrants on policies that directly affect them.
Further considerations applicable to this topic
The European Commission would welcome proposals with broad geographical scope engaging applicants from diverse regions across the EU.

Background
Children constitute a large share of the migrants arriving to Europe: in 2019, from 123,700 migrants who arrived to the EU via the Mediterranean routes, 27% were children, often unaccompanied by family or adults responsible for them. 7.1% of children applying for asylum in the EU-27 in 2019 were unaccompanied, standing for 14,100 asylum applications. The majority of unaccompanied children were boys (85%), and two-thirds were aged 16 to 17 (9200 people)[1] about to reach the age of maturity. It is indeed a common feature across the EU that the majority of the unaccompanied children registered as present on their territories are close to reaching the age of 18.
When an asylum applicant, refugee or migrant child reaches the age of 18, several legal protection measures and guarantees offered up until then cease to be available. Very frequently, unaccompanied children who turn 18 must immediately leave the specialised care facility, where they were accommodated as children. They immediately face difficulty in securing proper accommodation, if public support or third-party guarantees are not available for contracting on the real estate market. At the same time, young adults abruptly lose the benefit of guidance and support from their representative or guardian, whose legal mandate is then discontinued. In some jurisdictions, migrant children who have not obtained international or subsidiary protection or a humanitarian permit may have a difficulty to regularize their stay after turning 18. This may in turn impede any continued education or training, and respectively, their access to the labour market.
A 2014 study commissioned by the Council of Europe and the UNHCR[2] identified several specific areas where transition to adulthood requires support, including psychological impact, specific guarantees in the asylum procedure, family reunification, access to education and vocational training, access to accommodation, health care and information.
The 2017 Communication on the protection of children in migration identified serious gaps in the protection offered to migrant children in various areas and set out recommendations on how to address those. The Commission highlighted that migrant children need continued support to facilitate their transition into adulthood – support that should be initiated prior to reaching maturity and continue after turning 18 years old.The 2017 Communication maintains its relevance and importance, particularly in light of the forthcoming Pact on Migration and Asylum and the ongoing reform of the Common European Asylum System.
Applicants are invited to take note of the following publications and further bibliography therein referenced:

Objectives
The objective of the call is to stimulate and support the exchange of good practices and knowledge-sharing amongst various relevant actors - in particular public administrations and institutions, international organisation, private organisations and citizens (non-exhaustive list) - providing support to unaccompanied migrant children during their transition to adulthood.
This topic is not aimed at capacity-building for institutionalised care systems, or research on transition to adulthood and forms of supporting it.
Actions
Proposals should include actions aimed at increasing the exchange amongst relevant actors of good practices, and enhancing knowledge across the EU on supporting the transition of unaccompanied migrant children to adulthood, in particular:
Conferences, workshops, seminars, thematic meetings, study visits,
Exchange programs,
Developing training modules that can be further shared for other similar actions in the future, including outside the scope of the financed program,
Providing training developed under the program or in other contexts to the chosen beneficiaries of the program – public and/or private actors who provide support to unaccompanied minors to ease their transition towards adulthood.
The list above is not exhaustive or cumulative, and proposals may include other actions beyond those listed above. Proposal should clearly lay down how the actions will serve to increase the exchange of good practices and to enhance the knowledge across the EU on supporting the transition of unaccompanied migrant children to adulthood.
Good practices, trainings[3]/and any other relevant activities for supporting the transition of unaccompanied migrant children to adulthood referred under this topic should relate to one or several areas where transition to adulthood requires support, such as for example psychological impact, specific guarantees in the asylum procedure, family reunification, access to information, access to education and/or vocational training, access to accommodation and health care.
Proposals should ensure that the public actors who are relevant for the proposed actions are consulted on the design and implementation of the proposed actions, as to ensure that they will derive the maximum benefit of the actions therein proposed. These actors are in particular child protection agencies, ministries/authorities for children or social affairs; social protection; children’s ombudspersons; social services responsible for: housing, labour market integration, higher education and vocational training; health and mental health; counselling and psychosocial support; caregivers' associations, civil society organisations; academia, etc.
Outcomes
Proposals should focus on contributing to the achievement of the following outcomes:
Increased exchange of good practices and 'know-how' for supporting the transition of unaccompanied migrant children to adulthood;
Reinforced offer of trainings, exchange programs, study visits and other relevant activities on supporting the transition of unaccompanied migrant children to adulthood to the benefit of the relevant public and private actors.
Further considerations applicable to this topic
Proposals should demonstrate adequate design of the monitoring and evaluation component in the project implementation phase. Proposals should present methodologies and metrics that are appropriate for measuring progress of the actions, which should involve quantitative and qualitative indicators.
For the benefit of design, implementation and dissemination of the results the project, proposals are recommended to include in the consortium relevant partners from the national, regional and local levels.
Proposals should build upon the results of previously funded projects where relevant, such as in particular:
The Daphne Toolkit,
Commission grants managed by Directorate-General for Justice and Consumers by and in particular for projects on the rights of the child.

","13 September 2017","Specific Challenge:
As compared to bioeconomy sectors such as food-chain or bioenergy which keep hold of consolidated official statistics, there is a current lack of reliable and uniform ones on bio-based industries and bio-based products. In spite of progress made by the European Bioeconomy Observatory and other initiatives to gather data on the use of biomass for bio-based products, the following hurdles are still laying ahead to reach a widespread data availability: (i) There is lack of a comprehensive database with statistics for industrial uses of biomass from primary and secondary sources, (ii) The flow from raw materials to end products cannot be inferred from existing databases, (iii) There is insufficient comparability between different databases, (iv) Methodologies for data collection are not always transparent and existing data rely to a large extent on industry surveys and estimations of experts. This data gap hinders the development of economic models enabling the quantification of the bioeconomy and its economic, environmental and social effects. In turn, it has a negative effect on the ability of policy-makers to set the most appropriate policies to encourage investment in the bioeconomy in view of factors such as competition/synergies and possible trade-offs between various biomass uses.
Scope:
Proposals shall develop and implement a method for the collection of data on bio-based products, taking into consideration the incorporation of the data in the European statistical infrastructure (Eurostat), building on and contributing to on-going activities on exemplary bio-based products (Bio-based Succinic Acid & 1,4-Butandiol, lubricants). The following aspects will represent the framework for developing the proposals: (1) links with current CEN standardisation work on bio-based products; (2) training support or technical inputs to official customs and competent laboratory staff in Member States and to relevant activities within the existing programmes such as Customs 2020 and European Union Customs Competency Framework (EU Customs CFW); (3) definition of the minimum bio-based carbon and/or bio-based content for some bio-based product groups (except bio-based lubricants); (4) data compatibility with European and international databases (e.g. FAOSTAT, PSD, etc.). Data generated should be fed into economic models, existing or newly developed, enabling the description of the development of the bioeconomy, its interaction with the rest of the economy, and its economic, environmental and social impact. Consortia should include a balanced combination of expertise on bio-based products, statistical reporting from Member States and modelling. Proposals should build upon the existing work of completed and on-going projects, including the current activities of the Bioeconomy Observatory, RRM-Group as well as the Commission study on Biomass Supply and Demand.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of up to EUR 6 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude the submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
As a step forward in setting the most appropriate policies to encourage investment in the bioeconomy and defining possible trade-offs between various biomass uses, proposals will have to achieve:
An implementation of an EU framework for the collection of data pertinent to bio-based products including disaggregated product-level statistics enabling the systematic monitoring of the evolution of bio-based product markets.
The development of statistics and modelling tools providing decision-makers with the capacity to monitor bioeconomy developments and formulate clear targets and consider future impacts of present-day decisions, in particular in relation to establishing an efficient strategy for biomass use in the EU. Contribution to interoperability activities (e.g. bioeconomy related models, database interface specifications).
Demonstrate direct benefits to the bio-based industries in the form of an enhanced capacity to provide evidence of these industries’ economic, environmental and social impact in quantitative terms."

","13 September 2017","Specific Challenge:
Climate change and associated natural disturbances will increasingly influence the current distribution and productivity of tree species, within the constraints of physical barriers, long production cycles and regulations on forest reproductive materials. They will also affect the areas in which trees of different species and provenance could grow, or grow better, in the future. Assisted migration of tree species from one region (or continent) to another has contributed to increased wood production in Europe in recent centuries. Though there are examples of good practice and benefits of genetic variation, there is still limited evidence of the inherent genotypic/phenotypic plasticity of tree species and provenances, and their symbionts, to adapt rapidly enough and survive the current pace of environmental change. To counteract climate-induced decline and maintain/enhance forest productivity and meet the growing needs of society and the bioeconomy, we may enhance the resilience of forests through the selection/development of new genotypes, through traditional methods of genome sequencing and selection of desired traits and/or novel methods of genome improvement.
Scope:
Proposals should aim to develop novel tree breeding strategies and tools aimed at sustained yields (wood and non-wood products), while addressing resilience to climate change and natural disturbances (including pests and disease outbreaks), and considering biodiversity-related aspects. Proposals will aim to identify/develop genotypes with appropriate adaptation profiles for possible extension/change of tree species range, both vertically and horizontally, including those genotypes with potential for use on marginal land. Coniferous and broadleaved species that are of specific importance for forestry and ecosystem services EU-wide should be targeted. Compliance with biosafety and other relevant legislation (e.g. biodiversity and invasive alien species) should be taken into account. Complementarity with previous (FP7/LIFE) projects and COST actions should also be considered.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of up to EUR 6 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude the submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
To counteract climate change, maintain and enhance forest productivity and the sustainability of forestry systems, proposals should show how some, or all, of the following impacts will be achieved:
direct technical support for forest managers on the choice of tree species and provenances to increase stress tolerance to underlying environmental change and meet increasing societal demands on forest goods and services;
better understanding of benefits and risks related to the economic performance of wood-value chains and the environmental effects of the enhanced use of novel biotechnologies."

","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Increasing societal demands and emerging policies relating to forest resources present new challenges for the sector and trigger the need to enhance the multi-functional role of forests in the EU. The quantity and the quality of wood yields depend on site conditions, forest management objectives, silvicultural regime and measures taken from the establishment of forest stands to the end of rotation (for even-aged forests) or the selection harvest (for uneven-aged forests). Managing forests' horizontal and vertical structure is crucially important given the long production cycles involved and the demand to adapt, within the production cycle, to the evolving framework of environmental and societal conditions. It is therefore desirable to develop intelligent (i.e. cost-efficient, productive and environment-friendly) and novel solutions and tools to support sustainable wood production from forests managed on a multifunctional basis.
Scope:
To add value to wood production and enable close-to-market outputs, proposals should aim to develop a series of cutting edge technologies in relation to forestry measures starting from seedling/replanting, through to harvesting. Activities should aim directly at producing plans and arrangements or designs for new, altered or improved products, processes or services. For this purpose they may include prototyping, testing, demonstrating, piloting, large-scale product validation and market replication. SMEs active in the forest-based sector are specifically encouraged to participate in consortia.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of up to EUR 2 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude the submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
With a view to enhancing the multifunctional role of forests, proposals should show how some, or all, of the following impacts will be achieved:
Improved tools for sustainable forest management decisions and operations in primary production systems, marketable within a period of up to three years from the approval, entailing higher efficiency in operation;
Lower environmental impact of forest management and harvesting operations, in order to preserve forests' capacity to provide for non-wood forest products and essential ecosystem services such as carbon sequestration, biodiversity conservation, water regulation, soil and nutrient regulation, and recreation;
Sustainable supply of quality wood for the growth of forestry enterprises in the bioeconomy and the creation of new jobs in SMEs.."

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
A strong bioeconomy requires a diverse biomass feedstock for the bio-based value chains. The bio-based industries are looking into diversification of their feedstock base by adding new sources. Dedicated, purposely grown industrial crops and novel sources of biomass to deliver specific compounds for further processing into chemicals and materials, present an attractive route to high value applications.
These new biomass feedstock sources from dedicated, purposely cultivated industrial crops and novel sources of biomass (cultures), promote the creation of new value chains, utilising the natural properties of the feedstock for new functionalities of the desired products.
The challenge is to demonstrate the sustainability of these new value chains on a larger scale. This includes the upscaling of the processes using the technologies for dedicated biomass production, in order to provide for a sustainable supply of the new feedstock and the conversion into useable products for application in specific market segments.
Demonstrating the benefits for the environment, the economy and the society will contribute to the market-uptake of the end-products and to an improvement of the competitive position of the European bioeconomy.
Scope:
Demonstrate the techno-economic viability and sustainability of complete value chains based on utilisation of dedicated, purposely developed biomass production systems as feedstock for the bio-based industries.
Specifically, this topic focuses on non-food-conflicting biomass production systems:
whose molecular structure or growing conditions are tailored in order to maximise the output of the desired molecules, and/or
that are suitable for cultivation on unused, marginal or contaminated land that is currently not in use. Proposals addressing this point could also contain remediation actions for marginal or contaminated soils in order to convert or return these lands to use for agricultural purposes, and/or
that can be cultivated in novel and highly resource-efficient conditions.
The sustainability of the entire value chain should include the ability to deliver products, meeting safety and quality requirements, at competitive price level versus those from existing value chains.
A sound business model should include the role of all actors in the value chain, from the feedstock supplier to the actors on the end-market. Furthermore, the model should show that the value chain does not interfere with the food chain.
Proposals should achieve technology demonstrated in an industrial environment, or a system prototype demonstration in operational environment. Proposals need to address the whole value chain, from feedstock sourcing to market applications (Technology Readiness Levels 6-7).
Proposals should also include a Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) in order to evaluate the environmental and socio-economic performance of the whole value chain.
It is considered that proposals with a total eligible budget of up to EUR 15 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals with another budget.
Expected Impact:
Reduction of land use in comparison to the current productivity for the same product categories, when obtained from crops or other conventional primary biomass sources.
When dealing with industrial crops, diversification and increase of farmers' revenues through access to new markets.
Reduction of Europe’s dependence on imports of the targeted product, where applicable.
Safety, quality and purity of the (new) products are in line with EU legislation and proven to meet end-market requirements in order to facilitate future market access and commercialisation.
Projects under this topic should result in 1 new building block based on biomass of European origin validated at demonstration scale (KPI 4) and/or at least 1 new bio-based material (KPI 5).

With a foreseen market growing around 300% during the next four years, bio-based plastics are a broad sector with the potential of expanding in virtually all fields presently dominated by fossil-based plastics. However, although the production of several polymers/plastic materials starting from renewable and bio-based sources has already been demonstrated, further improvements are still required in order to:
make bio-based products and the related value chains at least fully competitive in terms of functionalities, costs and sustainability, in comparison with the current fossil-based solutions; and
expand the range of bio-based polymers/plastic materials and of useable feedstock for their production.
The market-pull of bio-based products based on end-users’ needs in different applications, calls for different properties: processability, lightness, flexibility, temperature-resistance and other mechanical features, all of which relate tightly to the purpose/application of each biopolymer and bioplastic. The demand for new and improved functionalities is increasing. The bio-based industries must be able to produce biopolymers and bioplastics with the specific, required functionalities in order to meet their projected high market demand and expand the range of application. The use of bio-based materials in some applications can add new and better properties to the targeted products, due to the inherent chemical structure of bio-based polymers and/or to the possible functionalisation of current polymers with bio-based additives (such as bio-fillers, wood, etc.).
The challenge is to demonstrate efficient production routes to bio-based polymers/plastic materials with identified functionalities that can outperform fossil-based processes and materials.
Scope:
Demonstrate the techno-economic viability of the production of innovative biopolymers/bioplastic materials with functional properties matching the needs and requirements of well-identified applications in the fields of health and medical, construction, automotive, and textile markets.
Each proposal should focus on one of the abovementioned market sectors but can include more than one proposed solution for that market sector. Its subject products and materials need to demonstrate effective improvements in functionalities and savings in terms of operational costs and environmental impact.
Proposals should address a small number of well-focused applications and include the direct involvement of end-users of the developed products and materials, providing clear requirements and KPI’s at the start of the proposal phase.
Proposals should demonstrate the sustainability of feedstock sourcing, material production and end-of-life handling through reusability, recyclability and/or biodegradability of the bio-plastics. The demonstrated sustainability involves the whole value chain, including actors in the supply chain, and costumers and end-users of the developed products.
Proposals should assess the feasibility of a wide application of the developed production solutions, in order to facilitate a relatively rapid scale-up and allowing a fast market deployment.
Safety, quality and purity of the products must be in line with commercial and/or regulatory requirements by actively building upon existing knowledge and standardisation activities.
Proposals should seek complementary to the projects funded under topic H2020 SPIRE-03-2016, to avoid overlaps and promote synergies.
Proposals should achieve technology demonstrated in an industrial environment, or a system prototype demonstration in operational environment. Proposals need to address the whole value chain, from feedstock sourcing to market applications (Technology Readiness Levels 6-7).

Eco-designed product to obtain recyclable material.
Improved life cycle sustainability of products (including end-of-life) by 20% as compared to non bio-based counterparts.

Despite the improvements in sorting and recycling, a large fraction of Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) is still landfilled (31%) or incinerated (26%) across Europe. This practice is posing environmental concerns, as well as wasting potentially useful resources contained in MSW. In particular, the abundance of sugars and other potentially interesting organic matter are identifying MSW as an alternative source of feedstock for the bioeconomy. Differentiating and enlarging the biomass feedstock portfolio are key objectives of the bio-based industries in Europe. Exploiting MSW, one of many residual streams in today’s economic activities, as a biomass feedstock source, contributes to these goals. At the same time, utilizing MSW as a feedstock source for biorefineries helps realising the EU circular economy through industrial symbiosis, i.e. collaboration between producers to use each other’s by-products.
Lab scale technologies have shown feasible treatment and subsequent conversion of the organic fraction of MSW into a number of products or intermediates for further use (fuels, chemical building blocks, polymers, additives, etc.). The challenge is to demonstrate the large-scale, economically competitive deployment of treatment and conversion technologies of the organic fraction of MSW into final or intermediate products for identified further use.
Scope:
Demonstrate the techno-economic viability of the conversion of the organic fraction of MSW into chemical building blocks, polymers or additives. The developed approach should be robust and able to tackle the issues inherent to MSW treatment, such as variability in composition (among others seasonality and geographic location) and presence of inhibitors to downstream biotechnological processes.

Proposals should assess the feasibility of market deployment of the products, taking into account the issues tied to the legislative framework related to waste-to-product applications. A sound business model should be provided. In particular quality and cost of the products must be such to ensure market uptake, and in any case at least comparable with existing comparable products. An accompanying full cost/benefit analysis takes into account the savings associated with avoidance of disposing of waste.

The European bioeconomy starts expanding to include new actors and less developed regions. This expansion is needed to build a bioeconomy at sufficiently large scale to sustain itself, and to fully exploit the European biomass potential. However, it also requires the removal of several hurdles in the development of new business approaches and models to realise the value chain build-up. Among the major challenges in expanding the bioeconomy in new areas is the scale of operation. Many innovative actors like SME’s, spin-offs and start-ups, willing to play their role, do not have the resources to set up large plants even if these may have a high return of investment. Smaller, modular, ready-to-deploy model would be beneficial for unlocking this potential. Also, logistics constraints and supply chain uncertainties play a big role in ensuring the sustainability of new value chains.
The challenge is to design innovative models to enable the build-up of sustainable new, local bio-based value chains involving biomass producers, waste management operators, logistics operators, government administrations and the processing and end-market actors. Where necessary, actions need to compare with ongoing programmes in Horizon 2020 addressing Rural Renaissance to avoid overlap, but seeking synergies.

Demonstrate the techno-economic viability of local deployment of innovative modular and decentralised biorefinery concepts for the build-up of local value chains. A highly efficient, locally (in the close vicinity of the biomass source) deployed value chain model can minimise the impact of feedstock logistics on the economic and environmental sustainability of the value chain.
Proposals can address both the manufacture of end-products in low volume, high added-value applications as well as the production of intermediates to be transported to a central facility for further conversion. In the latter case proposals should demonstrate innovative approaches to logistics, transport and storage that enable the creation of a new value chain that would not have been possible (or competitive) otherwise.
Proposals should present a thorough business case for the new value chain, showing the integration of actors from the supply side through the end-market for the intended materials/products and its cost-competitiveness with existing competing solutions (if any).
Proposals should also include regulatory aspects and the market pull of the targeted chemicals, in order to match legislation requirements and those by costumers and end-users, with technical, environmental and economic aspects linked to the bio-based value chain. These aspects include safety, quality and purity of the products by actively building upon existing knowledge and standardisation activities.
Proposals should achieve technology demonstrated in an industrial environment, or a system prototype demonstration in operational environment. Proposals need to address the whole value chain, from feedstock sourcing to market applications (Technology Readiness Levels 6-7).
Proposals should also include a Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) in order to evaluate the environmental and socio-economic performance of the whole value chain.
It is considered that proposals with a total eligible budget of up to EUR 15 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals with another budget.
Expected Impact:
Diversification and increase of feedstock suppliers’ revenues through access to new markets and increased mobilisation of biomass.
Creation of new green jobs in rural areas.
Reduction of 10% of logistic and transport costs in comparison with current similar value chains.
Projects under this topic should result in 1 new building block based on biomass of European origin validated at demonstration scale (KPI 4) and/or at least 1 new bio-based material (KPI 5).
Contribution to other BBI JU Key Performance Indicators (KPI), specifically:
Creation of at least 1 new cross-sectorial interconnection in bio-based economy clusters (KPI 1), at least 1 new bio-based value chain (KPI 2) and at least 1 new cooperation project involving farmers and biomass suppliers, industrial stakeholders and end-users (KPI 3).

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Plant Molecular Factory is defined here as the use of plants or plant cells to produce high-value products such as proteins, peptides and bioactive secondary metabolites, particularly for pharmaceutical and medical/veterinary, diagnostic, agricultural and industrial applications, including strategies to engineer plants to allow better processing of biomass into such high-value products. The specific challenge consists in increasing the availability to end users, lowering the cost of end products by scaling-up efficient manufacturing and purification process (e.g. high expression yields, the recombinant product authenticity), shortening production cycles for necessary efficacy and achieving high product yield. For the successful implementation market related issues such as regulatory compliance and approval, public acceptance and engagement need to be fully addressed.
Scope:
Project(s) under this topic should be industry driven and focus on the demonstration of innovative technologies for molecular farming approaches. Higher and lower plants or plant cells, or algae can be considered. Bottlenecks such as the optimization of gene expression, use of proper cell lines, and maximizing efficiency of downstream product purification may be considered. Project(s) could also encompass issues related to protein stability and degradation and/or improvements of bioreactor/containment design, and culture parameters. Furthermore, the authenticity challenge may be addressed. The techno-economic viability of the proposed concepts, the overall economic and environmental sustainability issues should also be critical elements and confirmed by LCA. To address properly regulatory compliance and approval and public acceptance issues, involvement and consultation with appropriate regulatory bodies and consumer and civil society groups (NGOs, end-user organisations etc) are necessary. This will create an efficient and cost-effective alternative methodology for the production of high value end-products. A strong participation of industry/SMEs should help contribute to the realization of the expected outcomes.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of an indicative amount of EUR 9 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
The project(s) shall contribute to the objective of improved competitiveness of European bioindustry, and be of benefit to users by allowing development of end-products with superior safety and economic parameters. This will be achieved by upgrading plant-based protein production platforms to the level of currently used and more advanced microbial or animal cell systems, opening thus full range of additional benefits arising from plant based production (scalability, absence of shared pathogens etc).
It is expected that action funded under this topic will advance the opportunity shown at research scale into demonstration scale, to allow the technology to become mature and fully economically competitive. This will be achieved by focusing on end-products with high value, by ensuring early industrial engagement and by addressing pertinent regulatory and public acceptance issues. The Technology Readiness Levels covered by the projects could range from 4 to 7.
It is expected that this action will create new opportunities for European bioindustries by increasing the application of bioactive molecules for the end product development and that it will allow an effective integration of research community, agriculture, bioprocessing industry and end-user representative groups."

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Terrestrial biomass is the most abundant resource of fixed renewable carbon on earth. It is present in resources such as food crops and woody crops, as well as in agricultural and forest residues. This enormous resource of fixed renewable carbon is an attractive feedstock-base for a bio-based industry, provided this is realised in a sustainable fashion, without loss of biodiversity, not causing indirect land use change (ILUC) nor negatively affecting food security. Tapping this resource in the EU for the production of bio-based chemicals and materials, will accelerate the establishment of an EU-wide bio-based industry and contributing to the goals of Europe 2020. Today, most polymers such as polyesters, polyamides and polyolefins depart from fossil-based chemicals as building blocks. However, there are also various routes to convert biomass or bio-based feedstocks into chemicals, polymers and materials.
Projects at demonstration level (Technology Readiness Levels 6-7) already pursue the establishment of these new value chains by using bio-chemical, chemical or other technologies and processes. However, the challenge lies in establishing at industrial scale (Technology Readiness Level 8) first-of-a-kind, cost-effective biorefineries that convert biomass into chemicals, polymers and materials for identified applications.
Scope:
Demonstrate at industrial scale the techno-economic viability of transforming one or multiple bio-based feedstocks into one or more bio-based chemical building blocks (such as diacids and diols, but focussing on the ones not used for energy), targeting a production capacity of at least 5,000 ton/year. Proposals should also address their further conversion into bio-materials for identified applications, as part of an integrated biorefinery concept applying a cascading approach.
Proposals should pursue all possible means of industrial symbiosis within and beyond the bio-based industrial sector. Furthermore, proposals should aim at the integration of actors along the whole value chain and, wherever possible, make use of existing facilities.
Proposals should prove the sustainable and economical access to sufficient raw material to set up the whole value chain, and include activities to ensure the functioning/organisation of a sustainable supply chain.
Proposals will assess market demand of the targeted products and will consider market-pull related activities (for example standardisation and consumers’ perception) aimed at facilitating their market uptake.
Proposals are expected to verify and validate safety, quality, sustainability and purity of end-products to meet commercial requirements. Benchmarking of the targeted products and processes against commercially existing alternatives from fossil origin should also be considered.
The leading role of relevant industrial partners is considered essential to achieve the full impact.
Proposals should include a Life Cycle Sustainability Analysis in order to evaluate the environmental, social and economic performance of the developed products and the whole value chain.
Proposals should achieve a system that is complete and qualified for successful commercial operation (Technology Readiness Level 8).
It is considered that proposals with a total eligible budget of up to EUR 35 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals with another budget.
Expected Impact:
Opening up of significant potential for job creation in rural areas. Creating green jobs and facilitating the development of entrepreneurial activities throughout the entire value chain, with advantages for the primary sector (agriculture and forestry), the secondary sector (such as logistics, bio-product transformation industry) and the tertiary sector.
Improved cost-efficiency and sustainability of bio-based chemical building blocks (such as diacids or diols) as compared to fossil-based ones.

Wastewater of agricultural, industrial as well as municipal origin contains organic matter, and/or nutrients that can lead to eutrophication if discharged to aquatic systems.
On the other hand, these types of sludge also contain potentially valuable components (chemicals, sugars, oils, bioactive compounds, proteins, etc.) for bio-based industries that are currently not exploited. Using wastewater as a source of bio-based feedstock contributes to unlocking alternative biomass feedstock sources and helps to create new value chains for a strong bioeconomy. Moreover, valorising wastewater streams into bio-based products contributes to realising the EU circular economy through agricultural and industrial symbiosis, i.e. collaboration between producers to use each other’s by-products.
The challenge is to develop technologies for the recovery and conversion of the bio-based components in wastewater from industrial activities (chemical, pulp and paper, agro-food, etc.) or from municipal sewage to bio-based products.
Scope:
Develop innovative processes and technologies for separation of wastewater organic content or of some relevant fractions, and transform these into bio-based products. Proposals must include recovery and valorisation of a significant fraction of the useable components in the subject wastewater, and associated sludge, minimising the production of waste to be disposed.
Proposals should show the impact on the full value chain, and include the end-products foreseen. When obtaining intermediate products, quality and purity of these intermediates must be such that they enable conversion into the targeted end-products without further purification steps.
Proposals should provide evidence of the relevance of the wastewater stream(s) chosen for experimental validation, ensuring high replicability of the developed solution across Europe. Proposals should present a credible cost estimate for the proposed processes with a preliminary assessment of their competitiveness when scaled up.

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
In recent years, various studies have identified efficiency improvements for the pre-treatment, fermentation and downstream phases of the biorefining processes. However, the relatively high costs for pre-treatment and enzymatic hydrolysis have limited a wide application at industrial levels. In particular, enzymes represent significant capital and operational cost in the operation of most of the biorefineries. There are consolidated bioprocesses that convert pre-treated biomass at lower scales in one step into valuable bio-products without using technical and specific enzymes. For example, there are processes converting pre-treated lignocellulosic biomass directly by using extremely thermophilic, hemi-cellulolytic and cellulolytic microorganisms. The latter are indeed able to grow directly on pre-treated lignocellulose feedstock and convert a broad spectrum of substrates into a significant range of compounds. These are promising results that need to be further improved to allow implementation at industrial scale. The gains in processing costs and production yields offer sufficient room to be competitive with conventional biorefining technologies.
The challenge is to develop a conversion process based on a direct fermentation of the pre-treated biomass into bio-compounds that is competitive in terms of costs and yields with processes that include the separate enzymatic hydrolysis step.
Scope:
Develop a consolidated conversion that includes hydrolysis of the pre-treated biomass and the fermentation into bio-chemicals in a single-step. This will require the use of tailored microorganisms that can either be the result of engineering a microbial strain able to obtain a targeted compound to produce specific enzymes-like cellulases and hemi-cellulases, or engineering a microorganism able to disrupt lignocellulose and capable of producing a selected chemical intermediate.
Proposals should validate the developed solution at lab scale, but include indications of feasibility for scale-up and replicability. Proposals should assure complementarity to existing EU-funded projects for synergies and to avoid overlaps. Proposals should target a specific marketable product and can utilise several biomass feedstock to develop a process based on tailored microorganisms’ strains that is able to:
produce with high efficiency, enzymes during the production of fermentable sugars from the polysaccharides of the starting lignocellulosic biomass;
produce targeted compounds with satisfying results in terms of yields, titres and productivity levels via fermentation and conversion of hexoses and pentoses sugars;
resist potential inhibitors mainly coming from the preceding pre-treatment step.
The projects should cover any Technology Readiness Level (TRL) from 3 to 5. In the case of a pilot scale project (TRL 5), proposals should present a credible cost estimate for the proposed processes with a preliminary assessment of their competitiveness when scaled up.
Proposals should also include an environmental and socio-economic assessment, for example with an LCA. In particular, when targeting TRL 5, proposals should include an LCA in order to evaluate the environmental and socio-economic performance of the developed processes.
Proposals should include a cost/benefit analysis, in particular highlighting the economic advantages of avoiding the enzymes production phase.
It is considered that proposals with a total eligible budget in the range of EUR 2-5 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals with another budget.
Expected Impact:
Reduction of the costs (capital and operational costs) as compared to two-steps biorefinery processes that include enzymes production and use.
Introduction of new routes and technologies for bio-based processes with large potential for rapid scale-up and short time-to-market of the new bio-based products.
Development of new microorganisms capable of processing different kinds of feedstock, while ensuring high yields of the targeted products.
Higher competitiveness level of the new bio-based value chains as compared to value chains based on two-steps biorefining technologies.
Reduction of the upstream costs by 10% of the overall economics of the biorefinery, focusing in particular on the gains from avoiding enzymatic hydrolysis.

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Europe has substantial unused land. Some of this land is in this condition because of its inherent characteristics (difficult access, location, soil composition, climate). Other parts have once been profitable as farm land or otherwise, and now are abandoned as a result of overexploitation, pollution, climate change and/or exodus from rural areas.
The challenge is to put unused land back into production by cultivating dedicated industrial and forestry crops and their conversion into added-value products for identified applications. The challenge also includes establishing required logistics to ensure the supply of these crops to biorefineries, providing for a sustainable operation with minimal losses within the value chain.
Proposals should clearly show that there is no overlap with ongoing large scale initiatives such as the Flagship project FIRST2RUN funded under the AWP2014 call, rather showing complementarity in terms of feedstock, land and climate conditions, products, market and replication potential in Europe. Where necessary, actions need to compare with ongoing programmes in Horizon 2020 addressing Rural Renaissance to seek synergies with other projects in this field.
Scope:
Demonstrate the technical, economical and sustainable viability of the full system of converting dedicated industrial crops, cultivated on unused lands, into added-value products.
Proposals should identify the most suitable crop varieties for the selected environment, and implement sustainable agronomic practices to ensure long term land profitability. Proposals could also contain remediation actions for marginal or contaminated soils in order to convert or return these lands to use for agricultural purposes.
Proposals should not only include the (physical) identification of potentially available lands and the subject dedicated crops, but also the required logistics (handling, storage, transportation, etc.) for a sustainable delivery of feedstock at a biorefinery. Proposals should demonstrate that the quality of the biorefinery feedstock meets requirements for its further processing and conversion into added-value marketable products for application in specific end-market sectors.
Proposals thus cover the value chain up to the gates of a typical biorefinery and allow the implementation of a ‘land-integrated biorefinery’, embedding the supply chain within the total value chain and involving different partners in several sectors (feedstock suppliers, industrial players, end-customers, etc.).
Proposals should seek complementarity with activities funded under European Structural and Investment Funds (ESIF), for example with those related to biorefining or novel sources of biomass feedstocks, or bioeconomy capacity building.
Proposals include participation of all the different actors within the value chain contributing with their knowledge of the economical, technical and environmental aspects and opportunities associated with the implementation of circular economy.
Proposals should achieve technology demonstrated in an industrial environment, or a system prototype demonstration in operational environment. Proposals need to address the whole value chain, from feedstock sourcing to market applications (Technology Readiness Levels 6-7).
Proposals should also include a Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) in order to evaluate the environmental and socio-economic performance of the whole value chain. Especially, environmental considerations should be addressed when choosing marginal lands to be cultivated (such as conservation of biodiversity and continuity in the provision of ecosystem services).
It is considered that proposals with a total eligible budget of up to EUR 15 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals with another budget.
Expected Impact:
Turn at least 2000 hectare of current marginal lands into cultivated lands.
Diversification and increase of farmers'/forest owners' revenues through access to new markets, and/or creation of new primary agricultural jobs.
Safety, quality and purity of the (new) products are in line with EU legislation and have been proven to meet end-market requirements in order to facilitate future market access and commercialisation.

Around 100 Mt of food waste and residues from food processing industry are generated every year in the EU. Around 38% thereof happens at processing stage. The waste streams of the food industry include animal-based as well as plant-based streams. These waste streams or by-products are currently either unusable and go to disposal, or find only partial, low value utilisation. Significant amounts of compounds with potential for valorisation into high added-value products are lost in these by-products or waste-streams. Furthermore, disposing of these streams in landfill causes environmental issues due to their high landfill leachate and methane-emissions. Valorisation of food processing by-products or waste-streams hence represents both an opportunity and a necessity.
The challenge is to demonstrate viable large scale valorisation of by-products or waste-streams from the food processing industry, capable of handling a wide variety in composition.
In many cases, regulatory framework may also be an obstacle: animal residues (and also some plant-based waste-streams, such as citrus peels or winery effluents in some countries) are considered as potentially hazardous wastes and are subjected to strict regulation. This implies that disposal often represents the only viable option, resulting in high costs.
Scope:
Demonstrate at industrial scale the recovery of valuable bio-molecules from food processing by-products or waste-streams and their conversion into high added-value products of suitable quality to meet market requirements.
Proposals should address the whole value chain from the existing by-products or waste-streams to the end-products, including where applicable the recursive feeding of products back into the original value chain in a circular model (e.g. organic fertilisers).
Proposals addressing waste-streams or by-products that fall under specific waste legislation must prove that the developed technologies and processes fulfil regulatory requirements and are able to deliver safe products both for human health and for the environment.
Proposals should encompass the model of integrated biorefinery, be able to use a biomass from various European sources as input and be capable of delivering a range of products, either novel or equivalent to existing products.
Safety, quality and purity of the products must be in line with commercial and/or regulatory requirements by actively building upon existing knowledge and standardisation activities.
Proposals should also include a Life Cycle Sustainability Assessment in order to evaluate the environmental, social and economic performance of the whole value chain.
Proposals should achieve a system complete and qualified for successful commercial operation (Technology Readiness Level 8).
It is considered that proposals with a total eligible budget of up to EUR 30 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals with another budget.
Expected Impact:
When addressing valorisation of waste-streams:
Reduction of waste disposal by 20% in the selected value chain, as compared to the current situation.
Contribution to the European objective of reducing the recyclable (including organic) content in landfilled waste down to 25% by 2025 as per the EC’s Landfill Directive.

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Dependence on a single source of feedstock is one of the main bottlenecks for biorefinery operations. If biorefineries have the ability to process multiple inputs or to switch to different raw materials, they would have a substantial higher degree of flexibility in coping with feedstock price and availability variations. They will be able to follow market trends of raw materials, compensate for raw material price fluctuations and control their impact on the overall economics of biorefinery processes.
Handling different feedstock also requires dealing with their availability and composition that are a result of seasonal and geographical aspects. Increasing the ability to process a diverse supply of biomass feedstock at acceptable quality will allow a better utilisation of biorefinery capacity and improve its competitiveness.
The challenge is to develop flexible biorefining processes capable of handling feedstock of variable origin, composition and quantity without major investment in (new) equipment.
Scope:
Develop and validate at lab or at pilot scale the operation of a flexible biorefinery, able to tune its processes to accommodate different feedstock (without major investments in new equipment/facilities) in order to fully exploit the potential of biomass produced locally during the four seasons.
Proposals can focus on broad ‘one-fits-all’ technologies processing different biomasses, or on fast customisation of process conditions, e.g. by using different and specific enzymatic cocktails, to accommodate different types of biomass. In particular, proposals should prove the feasibility to use the same processing plant to process different feedstock by modifying and tailoring the operative conditions according to the available input.
Proposals should assess the feasibility of scaling up the developed solutions to semi-industrial level as a next step and replication in different regions and areas. Proposals should prove high conversion efficiency of different biomass feedstock into valuable bio-products.
Proposals should show the impact on the full value chain. Therefore, proposals need to involve a relevant range of biomass suppliers, representing the different biomass feedstocks under consideration. Proposals should seek complementary with the projects funded under topic H2020 RUR-8-2016 to avoid overlap and promote synergies.
The projects should cover any Technology Readiness Level (TRL) from 3 to 5. In the case of a pilot scale project (TRL 5), proposals should present a credible cost estimate for the proposed processes with a preliminary assessment of their competitiveness when scaled up.
Proposals should also include an environmental and socio-economic assessment, for example with an LCA. In particular, when targeting TRL 5, proposals should include an LCA in order to evaluate the environmental and socio-economic performance of the developed processes.
It is considered that proposals with a total eligible budget in the range of EUR 2-5 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals with another budget.
Expected Impact:
When targeting currently discontinuous biorefinery operations: Increased annual productivity of the targeted products by 10-20% as compared to the current production routes, proving the relevance of the continuity of biorefinery operations during the whole year.
Increased utilisation of biorefinery capacity during the year, thus reducing ‘down time’ that is mainly associated with fluctuations in biomass feedstock availability.
Reduction of 10-20% of the feedstock-related costs of a biorefinery as compared to a single-source biorefinery operating part-time during the year.
Biorefining capacity utilisation increase of 10-20% on annual basis.

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Bio-based packaging materials with advanced functionalities are gaining ground as compared to traditional paper bags and board boxes and fossil-based plastic containers, films, wrappers and bottles. Users in the end-markets are increasingly demanding advanced, 'smart' and even 'active' packaging to help increase the shelf-life of food. Improved characteristics like barrier to oxygen and UV, physical strength, resistance to temperature variations can help reaching these goals. Society and users are also demanding to improve end-of-life options for packaging material (such as being biodegradable, compostable, and recyclable).
The interest in new and smart food packaging is increasing by both brand owners and consumers. The latter group is vesting more interest in healthy food and in functional food in its quest for a longer and healthy life. Brand owners are seeking to gain marketing edge by taking leadership in meeting these needs in their respective fields. The challenge is to convert these market developments into a sustainable supply of useable material with functionalities that will outperform existing packaging materials while assuring consumer confidence by addressing safety concerns.
A key challenge for ensuring market uptake and realising the full potential impact of bio-based materials useable in new food packaging concepts is to prove their ability to meet market demand. The hurdle of a significant 'first mover' risk must be taken by providing a proof of concept of their successful and sustainable production. Establishing such new value chains requires bio-based (manufacturing) industries to seek a closer cooperation with market actors to understand the specific market demands, and with biomass feedstock producers and suppliers to ensure the long-term supply of the required sustainable feedstock for the desired bio-based materials.
Scope:
Develop bio-based materials with new functionalities for food packaging. The new materials need to provide the following objectives:
Prove performances at least equal to existing, comparable packaging materials in terms of mechanical properties and temperature resistance or in terms of liquid/oxygen/UV/CO2-barriers or antimicrobial activity.
In order to improve end-of-life options:
provide biodegradable or compostable alternatives; or
provide mono-material (easily recyclable) alternatives while matching the same properties (e.g. barrier) of existing multi-material ones.
Proposals should address a small number of well-focused applications, identifying the benchmark products to prove the better characteristics of the developed materials.
Proposals should include the direct link with end-market actors to provide clear requirements of the developed products and materials. Proposals should comply with existing legislation for food contact.
For specific applications, biodegradable packaging should be the preferred route. Design for recycling at end-of-life must be part of the early development stages for non-biodegradable packaging material.
The projects should cover any Technology Readiness Level (TRL) from 3 to 5. In the case of a pilot scale project (TRL 5), proposals should present a credible cost estimate for the proposed processes with a preliminary assessment of their competitiveness when scaled up. The new bio-based material should be at a competitive price to enable subsequent downstream steps for the production of films and flexible food packaging to suit market applications.
Proposals should also include an environmental and socio-economic assessment, for example with an LCA. In particular, when targeting TRL 5, proposals should include an LCA in order to evaluate the environmental and socio-economic performance of the developed products, with particular focus on the end-of-life phase.
It is considered that proposals with a total eligible budget in the range of EUR 2-5 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals with another budget.
Expected Impact:
Improved mechanical and/or functional properties of the developed packaging products in a specific field as compared with state-of-the-art.
In case the project focuses on biodegradability or compostability: contribution to fulfilling the European objective of reducing the recyclable content in landfilled waste down to the targets as per the EC’s Landfill Directive, by showing reduction in landfilling as end-of-life option for packaging material as compared to baseline. Biodegradability other than under industrial conditions should also be considered.
Reduction of costs, on a life cycle analysis basis, as compared to on-market materials.
In case the project focuses on the preservation of food products: Increase of at least 10% of the shelf-life of the targeted products.
Opening new markets for new applications of biodegradable materials.

Consumers and producers start to become increasingly aware of the need to make consumer goods that require less finite resources and that protect human health and the environment. The latter is also the aim of the REACH legislation by placing the responsibility on industry to manage the risks from chemicals and to provide safety information on the substances. Introducing safe bio-based alternatives contributes to protecting human health and the environment.
The challenge is to develop suitable safe bio-based compounds and derivatives to meet the high technical and safety requirements of downstream applications, replacing existing potentially hazardous compounds or where bio-based alternatives significantly reduce the impact on human health and the environment (eco-toxicity).
Scope:
Develop safe bio-based alternatives for chemicals, materials and additives in major application fields like polymers, paints and solvents to improve protection of human health and the environment. However, proposals are not limited to these application fields.
Proposals should show that replacing compounds by safe bio-based alternatives does not negatively impact the characteristics and performance of the application. The introduction of safe bio-based compounds needs to improve the protection of human health and the environment during the production, use and end-of-life handling of the product. Proposals should clearly specify benefits in terms of reduced or eliminated toxicity and environmental footprint versus existing and comparable products.
The accompanying business model should include concrete arguments to show that the new products containing the safe bio-based alternative (the ‘application’) are competitive with the targeted existing products. Market analysis and involvement of market actors should show potential market uptake based on technical, environmental and economic advantages.
Safety, quality and purity of the new products must be in line with commercial and/or regulatory requirements by actively building upon existing knowledge and standardisation activities.

With an expected significant growth in the next 4 years, biopolymers represent one of the leading sectors for bio-based products. The main driver behind this trend has up to now been the need to substitute conventional fossil-based materials with more sustainable bio-based ones, in particular in large volume consumer products such as packaging.
The ability of bio-based polymers to achieve improved functionalities, surpassing those of fossil-based ones, or even realising functionalities that are not achievable by fossil-based polymers offers opportunities to expand market applications for biopolymers far beyond the current state-of-play. In particular, these opportunities exist in high value market niches that require advanced functionalities.
Scope:
Develop and validate biopolymers with advanced functionalities for demanding sectors such as (but not limited to):
the biomedical sector, requiring biopolymers and derived materials with bio-compatibility and/or surface functionalisation (such as for antibacterial purposes);
the construction, automotive and aerospace sectors, in need of biopolymers to produce lightweight plastics and composites with excellent structural properties.

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
The organic fraction of Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) represents an abundant and cheap, albeit highly variable, bio-based feedstock. The advancements in sorting in the latest years have made bio-waste an extremely affordable feedstock (even available at negative price under some circumstances), attracting the interest of the biochemical industry. However, due to its high complexity in composition as well as the variability during the year, it is a challenging feedstock to be processed for bio-based applications.
Indeed, its utilisation has up to now been limited to mainly the production of biogas for co-production of thermal and electric energy and compost.
Conversion processes performance (in terms of yield, selectivity and titre) is hindered by the high variability of the input feedstock, resulting in the need of tailored sorting and pre-treatment of the feedstock. The latter steps reduce the presence of inhibitors for the downstream steps. However, the costs of the sorting and pre-treatment steps, combined with the need of high performance separation and purification, often hinder the overall economic feasibility of a waste-to-chemicals value chain.
Scope:
Develop and validate at lab scale innovative processes for conversion of the organic fraction of MSW into chemical intermediates aiming at:
maximising the yield of recovery of intermediates from the substrate;
minimising the presence of inhibitors in order to enable achieving profitable yields from the conversion of intermediates into products.
The innovation should focus on production of intermediates at high yield and low impurity level.
Proposals should take into account seasonal and random variability of the MSW content and address several compositions of the organic fraction, focusing on representative case studies taking into account local economic, social and climate conditions.

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Expanding the use of lignin as a feedstock for conversion into chemicals and materials such as fibres, resins and composites, is being researched and developed through the use of several technologies. Some of these technologies are proving themselves at pilot level.
The applicability of lignin-based materials is enormous because of their high versatility and variety. Market actors in various sectors are demanding suitable quantities of lignin-based products at specified qualities to test application in their end products. Industry needs to scale up the developed technologies in an industrial setting and prove their technical and economic feasibility in dedicated value chains. While delivering higher quantities of the targeted products, industry also needs to achieve and validate the performance of the products intended to meet market demand. Achieving both quantity and quality as required by the market, will set the basis for an extensive uptake of lignin-based products.
The specific challenge is to demonstrate the efficient and sustainable conversion of lignin into compounds (intermediates and/or final products) that are applicable in a variety of market applications.
Scope:
Scale up proven technologies to convert lignin into compounds for added-value products at suitable quantities and quality for testing and validating their desired performance in specific market sectors.
This topic includes any lignin-rich feedstock, provided it can be sourced and converted in a way that is sustainable both from an environmental and an economic perspective. Proposals should apply the principle of the cascading use of biomass to ensure high efficiency of resource use.
Proposals should demonstrate that the developed technologies will achieve a conversion rate of at least 60%. The conversion rate is defined as the share of carbon contained in the input lignin that is converted into valuable products, thus excluding the potential share of biomass diverted to energy use (even though such energetic usage aims at increasing the overall sustainability of the process).
Proposals should address all requirements for IA - demonstration actions as shown in Table 3 of the Annual Work Plan 2019.

Today, there are some open access research infrastructures (including private) spread across Europe, where applicants or interested parties can ‘shop’ for equipment and facilities they may need to carry out lab, test or pilot work. There is also a limited number of open access multipurpose demonstration facilities which are seen as a crucial alternative to effectively reduce the high capital investment requirements for bio-based industries from invention to the market. These infrastructures are not well known in the broad R&D&I communities across Europe. Neither are these communities aware of the type and available equipment and facilities that the various infrastructures have to offer. There is not enough insight into the extent that the available infrastructure meets the needs by bio-based industries in their ambitions to set up and implement development projects and contribute to the goals of the Bio-based Industries JU.
In addition, there are specific needs for the agro- and the forest-based bioeconomy that have to be taken into account.
The challenge is two-fold:
improve access to existing bio-economy related open access research infrastructure in Europe, ‘interconnect’ these to create a Europe-wide open access infrastructure for the bio-based industry; and
catalyse the expansion of capabilities of the infrastructure to cost-efficiently meet the (future) needs of bio-based industries. This should including multi-purpose demonstrators which enable SMEs and larger industries to progress from technology development to demonstration and subsequently into deployment and the commercialisation stage.
The Europe-wide open access infrastructure must be capable to protect IP Rights of users.
There are ongoing activities to open up key national and regional research infrastructures to all European researchers from academia and industry and ensuring their optimal use and joint development. Actions within BBI JU should seek synergies with these activities. Additionally, BBI-actions should be complementary with results from FP7 project BRISK.
Scope:

Share the obtained overview and insight for improved access. Analyse the demand for infrastructure by bio-based industries in the future (2020+), assess needed expansion of its capabilities to meet the demand and specify conditions to realise this. Proposals should address the following elements:
Coordinate the interconnection of major European bio-economy related open access research infrastructure (including multipurpose demonstrators) into an efficient EU infrastructure that will create possibilities for complementarity and synergies and optimal circumstances for future investments.
Improve access to existing infrastructure via communication, publishing the accessible inventory, etc. for the bio-based industry, including SME.
Estimate the need for open access research infrastructure by the bio-based industries in the EU now and in the future (2020+).
Assess the current capabilities, specific and in detail for each institute/unit of the existing infrastructure and define needed expansion to meet future demand.
Exchange Best Practices on model contracts to safeguard IP rights and facilitate the use of open access infrastructures.

The chemical industry and other sectors apply combinations of technologies to improve operational effectiveness in relevant situations. These technologies include, for example, physico-chemical, electro-chemical, biochemical and thermo-chemical conversion technologies, combined in an innovative manner. The concept of applying combined technologies, existing as well as newly emerging ones, may serve the bio-based industry sectors well in their pursuit to maximally valorise residual streams and unused or underutilised resources. This new way to convert biomass feedstock will result in the highest value and benefit for all concerned through partnership between the primary sectors and the emerging biobased sector. The specific challenge is to effectively apply new and innovative combinations of technologies in biobased value chains to maximise valorisation of the feedstock.
Scope:
Apply effective, new and innovative combinations of technologies in a large-scale, first-of-its-kind integrated biorefinery converting sustainable biomass streams from existing agro-, food-, aquatic or forest-based operations into added-value products for identified applications. The scope of this topic excludes energy carriers (such as liquid fuels or hydrogen) as the main products.
Proposals could also integrate technologies into existing large-scale biorefineries to increase the efficiency and value creation from the feedstock.
This biorefinery should fully integrate feedstock supply and processing technologies to deliver products with targeted functionalities to meet identified market demand at competitive prices. It should demonstrate effective and cost-efficient operation at a commercial level, applying where relevant the cascading use of biomass to maximise resource efficiency.
Proposals should include any processing technology that has been demonstrated in an optimised value chain at TRL 6-7 and should encompass all processing stages leading to intermediate and end products.

","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
The organic fraction of municipal solid waste (OFMSW) produced annually in the European Union is estimated at 88 million tonnes, rising to 96 million tonnes annually by 20201. On a global basis, cities produced about 1.3 billion tonnes of solid waste in 2012, of which a significant percentage was organic. This figure is expected to rise to 2.2 billion tonnes per year by 20252 . Containing mainly carbohydrates, proteins and lipids, OFMSW presents an important feedstock for biorefining to convert it into valuable compounds for applications in a variety of market segments. However, this precious feedstock is often perceived as a challenge for urban agendas due to its potential pressure on the environment and human health. Together with other waste streams, OFMSW is often used for energy recovery or sent to landfill. These disposal steps of OFMSW pre-empt exploiting its potential for valuable products achievable in cascading operations. Aerobic (composting) and anaerobic digestion processes on the OFMSW have been able to reduce this fraction going to landfill. However, these processes mainly result in low-value products such as compost, biogas and digestate. Building on earlier projects on OFMSW, industry is ready to scale up the total value chain to first-of-akind biorefinery at commercial level. Successful operation at this level will start to realise a better exploitation of the potential of the OFMSW in Europe. The specific challenge is to sustainably scale up the conversion of OFMSW into added-value products to commercial levels.

Scope:
Produce large-scale added-value end products from the OFMSW for identified market applications from a successfully operating, first-of-its-kind biorefinery. This topic excludes proposals having compost, digestate, biogas, methane or biofuels as the main products. When dealing with unsorted MSW, proposals could address the efficient separation of the organic fraction.
The activities of this biorefinery must be included in a strategy for the valorisation of the OFMSW resources of the area where the biorefinery is operating. In particular, projects should realise a biorefinery that is integrated in the existing territorial waste management scheme and policies, involving all relevant stakeholders from the public and private sectors, and seek to improve and optimise current waste management schemes and practices in the subject territory.
Proposals should be fit for replicability in other territories. The envisaged biorefinery should fully integrate feedstock supply and processing technologies to deliver products with targeted functionalities to meet identified market demand at competitive prices. It should demonstrate effective and cost-efficient operation at a commercial level, applying where relevant the cascading use of the biomass feedstock to maximise resource efficiency. Proposals may include any processing technology (excluding those leading primarily to compost, digestate, biogas, methane or biofuels) that has been demonstrated in an optimised value chain at TRL 6-7 and should encompass all processing stages leading to intermediate and end products.

","04 April 2019
","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
The implementation of biorefining concepts at large scales is often affected by the need to achieve a balance between pre-treatment steps and the main conversion phase. The need to obtain high-purity fractions from the starting biomass to be fed into the following steps entails the use of harsh conditions in the pre-treatments. This entails high costs caused by: (i) energy, water and/or raw materials (e.g. chemicals, enzymes) requirements; (ii) complexity of operations and maintenance; (iii) an increase in waste and residues generation; and (iv) increased production of inhibitor compounds that may affect the overall yields of biorefining processes.
On the other hand, soft operating conditions in pre-treatments often result in a lower effectiveness in biomass fractionation, thus directly affecting the yields in the targeted products during conversion phases.
Several technologies based on chemical, biochemical, physical processes or a combination of these has shown the potential to provide valuable and sustainable solutions to substitute and/or efficiently integrate pre-treatment processes currently implemented.
The specific challenge is to reduce costs and improve sustainability associated with the pre-treatment steps of biomass feedstock while making it possible to achieve of sufficiently high yields in the targeted products in the subsequent conversion steps.
Scope:
Identify and develop cost-effective, efficient and sustainable technologies for biomass pre-treatments, paving the way for feeding the biomass fractions/components obtained after pre-treatments into the subsequent conversion steps. The solutions developed may be based on chemical, biochemical or physical processes, or a combination of these.
This topic may include any bio-based feedstock, provided it can be sourced in a way that is sustainable both from an environmental and an economic perspective.
Proposals should prove that the pre-treatment solution developed has the potential, when compared to state-of-the-art processes, to decrease costs, inhibitors and waste streams formation, and to make maintenance and process control easier.
Proposals should include testing activities on targeted bio-based feedstock to prove the potential for the subsequent upscaling of the developed process.
Proposals should address all requirements for RIA as shown in Table 3 of the Annual Work Plan 2019.
The technology readiness level (TRL) at the end of the project should be 4-5 for the bio-based value chain in question. Proposals should clearly state the starting and end TRLs of the key technology or technologies targeted in the project.

","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
The long-term objectives of the BBI JU Initiative include: (i) increasing production of bio-based chemicals and materials to 25% of the total in Europe by 2030; and (ii) contributing to the European target of a 20% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 20201
A sustainable chemical industry plays a key role in achieving these long-term objectives. A roadmap to pursue the 25% chemicals and materials objective is being developed by a running BBI JU project2. To stay competitive, operators seek to cover the higher costs of processing biomass feedstock through a premium on the products they put on the market.
The chemical industry can convert pure biomass feedstock in dedicated processes into specific products, which can be characterised by a direct relationship between the amount of biomass feedstock and the ‘bio-based content’ of the products. This is a cumbersome undertaking with specific R&D needs and requiring potential investments to convert a chemical value chain into a dedicated biobased operation.
The chemical industry can also use existing infrastructures to co-feed biomass feedstock with fossilbased feedstock and convert the mixed feedstock into various products that all contain some biobased components. To set the basis for products’ premia along this path, the industry needs to attribute the contribution of the verified biomass feedstock to each specific product. The chemical operators seek to do this by applying the principle of conservation of mass in analysing the conversion systems from input to output (mass balance). This approach can only be deployed and maintained if it is properly and transparently communicated and accepted by the customers.
The specific challenge is to arrive at a thorough understanding of the applicability of mass-balance systems to attribute biomass feedstock to products
1See SIRA May 2017, chapter 2, long-term objectives 8 and 12.
2CSA project RoadToBio: http://www.roadtobio.eu/
Scope:
Analyse existing methods for measuring, tracking and attributing biomass feedstock share in mixed biomass-fossil feedstock systems to specific products, and analyse their usability as a common method for the sustainable chemical industry and for communication with customers.
Proposals should lead to understanding the pros and cons of existing different systems for mass allocation. The analysis should seek to yield one common system for use throughout the chemical and related downstream industries to benefit all. Proposals should also analyse the potential of misusing the mass-balancing system.
Proposals should also devise specific key messages for communication with relevant audiences. The messages should enable audiences to clearly distinguish between mass-balanced products from mixed feedstock systems and bio-based products from pure biomass feedstocks. Proposals should include at least one consumer communication pilot.
The scope of this topic excludes analysing the production, definition and benefit claims of bio-based products. CEN, Cenelec and ETSI have already developed definitions of ‘bio-based products’3 and guidelines for determining the bio-based carbon content of blends4.
Proposals should: (i) estimate the potential of using the proposed methodology to progress towards the SIRA long-term objectives; and (ii) estimate the associated benefits for the environment (based on LCA studies for selected exemplary cases). Proposals should utilise results of projects on standards and communication regarding bio-based products and the bio-based economy, if applicable and available.
The participation of organisations that could act as a link between the private sector (including brand owners) and the public sector (for example policy makers) is particularly encouraged.
The Bio-based Industries Consortium (BIC) will set up an industry and market expert group from among its members to provide expertise on the implementation and follow-up of the different tasks and help organise meetings. This expert group is not to be a part of the proposal, but will be offered to the project consortium to assist as needed. This expert group therefore should have an advisory role in the project but would not be a beneficiary in the consortium.

It is considered that proposals requesting a maximum of EUR 500 000 and a planned duration of not more than two years would be able to address this specific challenge appropriately. However, this does not preclude the submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts or durations.

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
The Bio-based Industries Consortium (BIC) sees as one of its major task as helping its members in obtaining investments for excellent projects. See for example BIC’s report to increase awareness about the European financial instruments to support the development and growth of the bio-based economy and demonstrate how to use them1 .
In addition to project scalability and investment readiness, seeking investment from any source also involves preparing and presenting the project and its potential benefits for society and investors in an effective way. BIC is therefore seeking opportunities to train industry actors, in particular SMEs, to be successful in securing investment for excellent projects. The opportunity BIC would like to pursue is through empowering interested SME clusters at regional level (BIC members as well as non BIC members) to train their SME members and to reward them for excellent performance through a competition, with the regional winners moving on to a European final. SME clusters therefore need to be empowered to train their SME members and to adequately run the competition.
The specific challenge is to design the appropriate tools and system to build the capacity of SME clusters so that they can train SMEs to devise excellent projects that are scalable, investment ready and which convey these qualities to potential investors.
1 A 2017 report ‘Access to EU financial instruments suitable for the implementation of large Bio-based industry investments’ on BIC website: https://biconsortium.eu/library/bic-documents
Scope:
Identify possible systems for enabling SME clusters to set up a platform where SME entrepreneurs in the bio-based industry and investors can exchange expertise and business opportunities that could lead to successful cooperation.
The scope includes the necessary steps to ‘train the trainers’ as well as practical steps SMEs can use when preparing and presenting projects with a high level of investment readiness.
The scope also includes building the capacity of SME clusters to build links with investors.
Proposals should consider: (i) the disparity across Europe of the investment activities; and (ii) the required skills for the trainers, so as to best assist the SME clusters and the different types of investors. The clusters should aim at becoming self-supporting in this respect after the project runtime with a clear plan to achieve this.
Proposals should devise a framework that can be used to select the best projects through a competition in which investors evaluate and select winning SME proposals at regional level. If the winner’s reward is a cash prize, its value is not an eligible cost in the framework of the grant agreement.
Proposals should also set the basis for a European final of regional winners, and hence, proposers should link up with relevant and interested regional authorities.
Proposals could build on the experience of the European Bio-Economy Venture Forum held on 6-7 June in Viborg, Denmark2.
The Bio-based Industries Consortium (BIC) will set up an industry and market expert group from among its members to provide expertise on the implementation and follow-up of the different tasks and help organise meetings. This expert group is not to be a part of the proposal, but will be offered to the project consortium to assist as needed. This expert group therefore should have an advisory role in the project but would not be a beneficiary in the consortium.
INDICATIVE FUNDING: It is considered that proposals requesting a maximum of EUR 1.5 million and a planned duration of not more than three years would be able to address this specific challenge appropriately. However, this does not preclude the submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts or durations.
2 See description on BIC website: https://biconsortium.eu/events/european-bio-economy-venture-forum
Expected Impact:
foster an increase of private investments into the bio-based sector through an effective cooperation between SMEs and potential investors;
improve the involvement and the role of SME clusters as a reference point for SMEs to cooperate, exchange expertise and meet potential business opportunities to implement successful bio-based projects.
NUMBER OF PROJECTS: a maximum of one project will be funded under this topic.

","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Residual streams from various industries contain functional molecules that could be used for food and non-food market applications. The functions of interest depend on the intended use of the final products that operators intend to make with the targeted molecules. Residual streams are any streams that are not main products of an industrial operation and are disposed of at low or no value. They include residues from the agricultural, livestock, marine, aquatic, fisheries, food processing, forestry and forest-based industry sectors.
Today, most of these residual streams either find low-value applications that are mainly based on their calorific content (i.e. they are used as fuel), or they are not used at all, often because of supply-chain constraints. The supply-chain constraints could be due to a variety of reasons, including: (i) the relatively long distances between where the residues are generated and where they can be processed; (ii) the low density and/or high water content of the residues; (iii) the capacity of available processing units exceeding available local feedstock.
It is crucial that the functional molecules from these residual streams be separated in a way that is cost-efficient, energy-efficient and eco-efficient. This will mean that these molecules can be made available for subsequent use in higher-value applications, which will provide significant employment and income opportunities for the primary sectors and may improve the commercial sustainability of existing processes.
Fully enjoying the opportunities of these functional molecules will only be possible if the availability of the residual streams can be maximised by resolving any supply-chain constraints.
Various technologies exist to separate and convert the functional molecules from residual streams into high added-value intermediates and products. However, the applicability of these technologies depends on sustainable integration of the feedstock supply. The specific challenge is to resolve supply chain hurdles and enable the recovery and processing of functional molecules in residual streams from various sectors.
The specific challenge is to resolve supply chain hurdles and enable the recovery and processing of functional molecules in residual streams from various sectors.
Scope:
Create and integrate a sustainable supply-chain system into a value chain that is capable of using available or new technologies to use functional molecules in residual streams in high-value food and/or non-food applications.
The scope of this topic includes all necessary steps to collect, transport and store the residual streams being targeted at the processing site. These steps could include pre-treatment actions if they are necessary to transport and/or store any of the targeted residual streams. The quantities, qualities and physical original physical locations of these streams determine the optimal location and size of the operational site that they integrate into. The operational sites can be either centralised large-scale biorefineries, or small/medium-scale processing units, or a combination thereof.
Proposals must be suitable for direct acceptance and implementation by farmers, foresters or fishers, depending on the supply chain addressed. Proposals therefore need to include these actors in the related primary sector as strategic partner(s) leading the value chain. The involved primary producers should participate in the design of the value chain and benefit from its results. In order to increase the participation of primary producers, it is recommended to promote the participation of relevant cooperatives as members of the consortium, as well as to foster the role of advisors or innovation brokers to support (‘speak on behalf of’) primary producers during the project implementation. Proposals should consider establishing an advisory board of primary producers that collaborates with the consortium by advising on and measuring the impact of the project.
Proposals should include processing operations tailored to local circumstances. These operations will need to cope with availabilities, distances, qualities of the residual streams, possible variations in these qualities, etc. The business case underlying the proposal must include a feasibility assessment (technological and financial) of: (i) the associated processes at the envisaged scale; and (ii) combinations with other relevant processes.
The biomass-feedstock supply chain is an essential part of the expected project proposals. Proposals must include proof that sufficient quantities of the targeted residual streams are available and exploitable to effectively and sustainably maintain the business case for future upscaling to commercial levels.
Proposals should include upstream processes if needed (e.g. pre-treatments), conversion routes, and downstream processes. Cascading concepts are a relevant part of the proposals.
Proposals may include physical, chemical or biotechnological routes (or combinations of these).
The designed value chain aims specifically at using the inherent functions of the residual streams. It focuses therefore on producing intermediates that equal or outperform their fossil-based counterparts. The targeted high-end market applications are necessarily more valuable that the market applications of these streams in the energy sector.
Proposals should also include market actors in the targeted market sectors to ensure application and economic impact.
If proposals aim at food applications, they must also include considerations of consumer safety and consumer perception of the targeted consumer applications. Any potential hazards associated with the developed processes and products should be analysed to check that the products will comply with relevant EU legislation on chemicals risk management, toxicity and safety.
Proposals must address all the requirements for demonstration actions shown in Table 3 of the Introduction.
The technology readiness level (TRL) at the end of the project should be 6-7. Proposals should clearly state the starting and end TRLs of the key technology or technologies targeted in the project.

It is considered that proposals requesting a maximum contribution of EUR 7 million would be able to address this specific challenge appropriately. However, this does not preclude the submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Gaseous-carbon emissions are a threat to climate stability when they exceed the extraction capacity of plants, forests and the sea. This threat has been present since gaseous-carbon emissions from industrial activities started to add to the natural (biogenic) carbon cycle. Some sections of industry are therefore seeking to create a low-carbon emission economy by avoiding or reducing fossil-based carbon emissions or capturing these emissions for storage or use. Carbon-containing emissions are also potential feedstock sources for industry (serving as ‘C1-carbon’ sources). Some conversion and use technologies for gaseous carbon have been proven in the laboratory and even at pilot scale. It is now time to scale up these technologies to demonstration level so they can subsequently be commercialised.
The bio-based industry can demonstrate efficient recycling and recovery concepts for its biogenic gaseous emissions. Turning biogenic emissions into something of value by producing valuable chemicals contributes to the industry’s ‘zero-waste’ biorefining objectives and abates climate change.
Biogenic gaseous carbon can be used: (i) as a feedstock for the conversion into platform chemicals; (ii) to increase the growth of biomass as feedstock for industrial exploitation; or (iii) to create energy solutions. However, the last option is not within the scope of this topic.
The specific challenge is to use biogenic gaseous carbon as a feedstock for the bio-based industry through: (i) direct conversion into bio-based chemicals or intermediates; or (ii) growing new biomass sources.
Scope:
Demonstrate the conversion of biogenic gaseous carbon into chemicals or intermediates for: (i) further processing into value-added applications; or (ii) using to grow new biomass.
Eligible gaseous feedstocks within the scope of this topic are: (i) C1-carbon emissions from biorefineries or any other bio-based operation, including anaerobic fermentation processes (e.g. in brewing and bioethanol production) and hydrothermal liquefaction and gasification of biogenic feedstock; and (ii) CH4 (methane) and CO2 from biogas [1] or syngas plants.
All proposals must include a description of the necessary logistics for the capture and preparation of the biogenic C1-carbon feedstock.
If the biogenic gaseous-carbon sources are mixtures, proposals must include cleaning or purification phases to prepare the C1-carbon feedstock for efficient conversion steps.
Proposals for converting the biogenic gaseous carbon into chemicals or intermediates can apply any relevant technology (biotechnological, chemical, combinations, etc.). Proposals must include the appropriate size for the operations (small, medium or large) to adequately handle the local availability of the feedstock sources. These sources could be dispersed over relatively long distances. Early involvement of equipment/machinery developers is essential. The business case underlying the proposal must include a feasibility assessment (technological and financial) of the associated processes at the planned scale and location, and in combination with other relevant processes.
Proposals for using biogenic gaseous carbon to grow biomass as feedstock for industrial exploitation must focus on capture, pre-treatment (as necessary), and the steps needed to grow biomass.
All proposals must show a clear direction for the envisaged value chain by including next steps to develop value-added products and applications.
Proposals must demonstrate the life-cycle benefits of the project.
The scope of this topic does not include processes that will lead to energy, fuel, or electro-fuels.
All proposals must address all the requirements for demonstration actions shown in Table 3 of the Introduction.
The technology readiness level (TRL) at the end of the project should be 6-7. Proposals should clearly state the starting and end TRLs of the key technology or technologies targeted in the project.

It is considered that proposals requesting a maximum contribution of EUR 7 million would be able to address this specific challenge appropriately. However, this does not preclude the submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
[1] Biogas consists of 60% CH4 and 40% CO2. Both biogenic gases can be utilised in an integrated concept to produce bio-based chemicals or intermediates, or used for growing new biomass sources. The number of biogas plants in the EU is increasing significantly (already more than 17,400 in 2015) of which only a fraction feeds into the natural gas grid, leaving large volumes of the gas available as local sustainable feedstock for conversion into added-value products.

","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Among the UN Sustainable Development Goals, ‘feeding the planet’ features prominently. The growing world population will need additional sources of protein and ingredients with high nutritional value that do not deplete finite natural resources. The food industry can make a substantial contribution by increasing its resource efficiency. However, there will also be a need to tap new sources of protein.
The aquatic and marine worlds and the fisheries and aquaculture industries contribute to the UN’s goal while maintaining healthy marine and aquatic ecosystems. Scientific evidence unambiguously points to sustainable culture and capture at low trophic levels as a way to bring about an increase of food production from aquatic resources [1] . These include, for example, microalgae, seaweed, marine invertebrates, side streams from the fish processing industry, and herbivore filter feeders (e.g. molluscs). Moreover, the recent implementation of the landing obligation for fish bycatch under the common fisheries policy [2] opens up opportunities for the efficient and sustainable transformation of such under-used streams into valuable ingredients.
A number of projects have demonstrated the successful conversion of aquatic biomass, mainly algae, into high-value ingredients for food applications. Actors in the aquatic and marine worlds are confident that by combining forces they can start converting the many aquatic and marine species and fisheries/aquaculture-industries side streams into food applications at commercial level. Europe can take the lead in this direction by enabling such a first-of-its-kind operation.
The specific challenge is to sustainably scale up the conversion of new and sustainable aquatic and marine sources for human food and contribute to food and nutrition security.

Scope:
Sustainably produce on a large scale in a first-of-its-kind industrial setting, ingredients with high nutritional value for food for human consumption from under-used species and/or side streams from: (i) marine and aquatic sources; or (ii) the fisheries industry.
The scope of this topic includes: (i) dedicated cultivation; (ii) harvesting from ecosystems; and (iii) the use of side streams from the fisheries/aquaculture industries – all to be done in a sustainable way.
Proposals for the cultivation of aquatic and/or marine biomass must include innovative and sustainable production and harvesting systems. They must also include the smart integration of several stages in the industrial-production plant to maximise biomass production and reduce production costs.
Proposals for harvesting from ecosystems must include an estimate of the available feedstock and plans to ensure the continued availability of this feedstock over the long term. Proposals must include sustainable and innovative harvesting systems. The objective of this requirement is to ensure that exploiting these sources for food ingredients preserves biodiversity and ecosystem services.
Proposals that focus on using side streams from the fisheries or aquaculture industry must include innovative conversion technologies and prove the sustainability of the whole value chain.
The scope of this topic includes: (i) bioreactor design where needed for the large-scale production of food ingredients; and (ii) integrating smart industrial-unit prototype design.
The main scope of this topic is the provision of food ingredients for human consumption. However, complementary production of feed ingredients or other high-value products (e.g. ingredients for cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, performance materials) may also be incorporated in projects. Proposals for these types of complementary production would be especially welcome if they contribute to the economic viability of the value chain and feature ‘no waste’ production. When aiming for high-value products other than food or feed, proposals need to consider the end-of-life phase of the complementary products, so that they are either fully recyclable, or else degradable or compostable under specified conditions [3].
Proposals must also include considerations of consumer safety and consumer perception of the planned new food ingredients. Any potential hazards associated with the developed processes and products should be analysed to check that the products will comply with relevant EU legislation on chemicals risk management, toxicity and safety.
The envisaged industrial setting must fully integrate: (i) feedstock supply and/or cultivation; (ii) sustainable logistics; and (iii) processing technologies. This is the best way to deliver food ingredients with targeted functions to meet human food demand at competitive prices. Proposals should demonstrate effective and cost-efficient operation at commercial scale, applying (where relevant) the cascading use of the biomass feedstock to maximise resource efficiency.
Proposals have to include the related primary sector(s) as strategic partner(s) in the value chain. This means that they participate in the design of the value chain and benefit from it.
Proposals should include market actors (e.g. brand owners, distributors, end-users) as strategic partner(s) in the value chain. These partners can assist in directing the value chain towards identified or newly emerging market demands.
Proposals may include any processing technology that has been demonstrated in an optimised value chain at TRL 6-7 and should encompass all processing stages leading to intermediate and end products.
Proposals must address all the requirements for flagship actions shown in Table 3 of the Introduction.
The technology readiness level (TRL) at the end of the project must be 8. Proposals should clearly state the starting and end TRLs of the key technology or technologies targeted in the project.

It is considered that proposals requesting a maximum contribution of EUR 16 million would be able to address this specific challenge appropriately. However, this does not preclude the submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts

","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
The sustainable production of bio-based platform molecules with a broad range of potential applications could increase the competitiveness of bio-based materials and products compared with their fossil-based counterparts.
Platform chemicals are intermediate molecules that can be used to produce a large number of endproducts, such as biopolymers, high-value additives, and other bio-based products. They can therefore unlock entire bio-based value chains if produced at competitive cost, to a high quality, and in sufficient quantities. Promising bio-based platform molecules include: HMF, FDCA, some organic acids, and alcohols [1] from various biomass feedstocks.
Market interest in bio-based platform molecules is increasing, and market actors are requesting larger quantities of these molecules for further formulation and testing in specific applications, including food, feed and consumer personal care. To foster the market penetration of these molecules — and make them competitive against fossil-based counterparts — industry must increase the production of targeted bio-based platform molecules. This must be done at a competitive cost and quality compared with the state of the art.
The specific challenge is to upscale the production of bio-based platform molecules in sufficient quantities and at sufficient quality to promote their larger application in new and existing markets.
[1] See for example the Joint Research Centre’s report ‘Insights into the European market for bio-based chemicals’ (2019).
Scope:
Demonstrate the sustainable production of specific bio-based platform molecules at quantities exceeding pilot-plant limits, so these molecules can be further processed for identified or newly emerging market applications.
The scope of this topic includes feedstock from any source: agricultural, food processing, forestry, marine, aquatic, fish processing, bio-waste, or any combination of these.
The scope of this topic excludes bio-based platform molecules that are currently already produced in Europe competitively, at commercial levels and in sufficient quantities, or that are the object of other BBI JU projects.
Proposals must focus on applications with added value that is greater than the added value the feedstock would have if used for energy or heating.
Proposals must include the related primary sector(s) as strategic partner(s) in the value chain. This means that these sectors must participate in the design of the value chain and benefit from the value chain. In order to increase the participation of primary producers, it is recommended to promote the participation of relevant cooperatives (in particular related to farmers or fishers) as members of the consortium, as well as to foster the role of advisors or innovation brokers to support (‘speak on behalf of’) primary producers during the project implementation. Proposals should consider establishing an advisory board of primary producers (in the related primary sectors of the proposal) that collaborates with the consortium by advising on and measuring the impact of the project.
As much as possible, proposals should align the value chains with the smart specialisation strategies of the relevant region(s), in either part of the value chain.
Proposals must address all the requirements for demonstration actions shown in Table 3 of the Introduction of the 2020 Annual Work Plan.
The technology readiness level (TRL) at the end of the project should be 6-7. Proposals should clearly state the starting and end TRLs of the key technology or technologies targeted in the project.

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
The organic fraction of municipal solid waste (OFMSW) presents an important feedstock for biorefining to convert it into valuable compounds for applications in a variety of market segments. However, this precious feedstock is often perceived as a challenge for urban agendas, due to its potential pressure on the environment and human health. Together with other waste streams, the OFMSW is often used for energy recovery or sent to landfill. This pre-empts exploiting its potential for valuable products achievable in cascading operations. Aerobic (composting), anaerobic digestion and energy recovery processes on the OFMSW have been able to reduce this fraction going to landfill. However, these processes mainly result in low-value products such as compost, biogas and digestate, and incineration of valuable resources.
Building on earlier projects on OFMSW, industry is ready to scale up the total value chain to a first-ofa-kind biorefinery at commercial level. Successful operation at this level will start to realise a better exploitation of the potential of the OFMSW in Europe.
The specific challenge is to sustainably scale up the conversion of OFMSW into added-value products to commercial levels.
Scope:
Produce large-scale added-value end products from the OFMSW for identified market applications in a successfully operating, first-of-its-kind biorefinery.
This topic excludes proposals having compost, digestate, biogas, methane or biofuels as the main products. It also excludes proposals having OFMSW sub-streams (such as food-processing waste, food waste from hotels, restaurants and the catering industry) as the main part of the feedstock for biorefining.
If applicable, the OFMSW may be mixed with municipal wastewater sludge, but keeping the OFMSW as the main fraction. Complex and heterogeneous municipal solid waste must be the main feedstock addressed by proposals.
The activities of this biorefinery must be included in a strategy for the valorisation of the OFMSW resources of the area where the biorefinery is operating. In particular, projects should realise a biorefinery that is integrated in the existing territorial waste management schemes and policies, involving all relevant stakeholders from the public and private sectors, and seek to improve and optimise current waste management schemes and practices in the subject territory.
Proposals should be fit for replicability in other territories.
The envisaged biorefinery should fully integrate feedstock supply and processing technologies to deliver products with targeted functionalities to meet identified market demand at competitive prices. It should demonstrate effective and cost-efficient operation at a commercial level, applying where relevant the cascading use of the biomass feedstock to maximise resource efficiency.
Proposals may include any processing technology (excluding those leading primarily to compost, digestate, biogas, methane or biofuels) that has been demonstrated in an optimised value chain at TRL 6-7 and should encompass all processing stages leading to intermediate and end products.
Proposals should address all requirements for IA - flagship actions as shown in Table 3 in the Introduction.
The technology readiness level (TRL) at the end of the project should be 8. Proposals should clearly state the starting and end TRLs of the key technology or technologies targeted in the project.
INDICATIVE FUNDING
It is considered that proposals requesting a maximum contribution of EUR 15 million would be able to address this specific challenge appropriately. However, this does not preclude the submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Lignin occurs in wood and non-wood cellulosic biomass. It is available in very large quantities as a byproduct of lignocellulosic biorefineries and chemical pulping operations. Although it is a valuable biopolymer, it is currently mainly burnt as low-value fuel.
Several projects are running or have been completed at demonstration levels (TRL 6-7) to turn the byproduct lignin from industrial operations into added-value products, often replacing fossil-based counterparts in the process. Industry now sees enough opportunities to scale up these value chains to commercial levels. Large-scale transformation of lignin into high-end applications will significantly improve the economics of lignocellulose biorefineries. And replacing fossil-based products with ligninbased high-end products will make a significant contribution towards a climate-neutral Europe by 2050.
Lignin can be used ‘as is’ in various added-value applications, among others in the construction industry. In the latter case, lignin is able to sequester biogenic carbon for decades, and can substantially contribute to climate change mitigation. Lignin can also be treated to increase its usability in chemical and biotechnological processing. This processing allows it to be used in fibre applications, platform chemicals, and building blocks. The high polymeric character of lignin means it contains many functionalised molecules. Smart processing steps can therefore retain the desired polymerisation and functionality. Functionalised building blocks can lead to high-end applications in a variety of market sectors.
The specific challenge is to sustainably commercialise the transformation of lignin into chemicals and materials for high added-value applications.
Scope:
Produce on a large scale, in a first-of-its-kind operational setting, components from by-product lignin for use in established or newly emerging high-value applications [1].
The scope of this topic is to make use of lignin-containing by-products from existing operations that today are ‘wasted’ or burnt, provided they will be sustainable feedstock for large- or medium-scale operations. This topic’s objective is to resolve an existing situation of under-use of the by-product lignin from lignocellulosic biorefineries, not to use crops that are cultivated specifically for lignin.
The scope of this topic includes both greenfield biorefineries and refurbished industrial facilities.
Proposals must include the related feedstock supplying sector(s) as strategic partner(s) in the value chain. This means that these sectors must participate in the design of the value chain and benefit from the value chain. These benefits can include: (i) greater levels of employment; (ii) more high-skilled employment; (iii) better-paid employment; (iv) strengthening of the local or regional economy; and (v) increasing local biodiversity. In order to increase the participation of the primary sector actors, it is recommended to promote the participation of representative organisations (such as agricultural cooperatives for farmers) as members of the consortium, as well as to foster the role of advisors or innovation brokers to support (‘speak on behalf of’) the primary sector actors during the project implementation.
An essential requirement for project proposals under this topic is high efficiency in: (i) feedstock preparation; (ii) processing steps; (iii) formulation of materials into applicable high-end products; and (iv) formulation of building blocks into applicable high-end products. Proposals might therefore consider including digital technologies and tools to achieve high efficiency in all stages of the value chain.
The scope of this topic includes any processing technology with a proven track record of converting lignin into desired materials and components at lower TRLs.
Proposals must clearly specify the targeted chemical building blocks or materials from the ligninconversion steps. Proposals must also clearly specify the identified or newly emerging market application for the building blocks or materials.
The scope of this topic includes any application that demonstrates a high-end market application of the obtained lignin-based products. These applications may range from creating components in the construction industry to applications in sectors such as textiles, cars, cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, and packaging. Successful proposals will include market actors as strategic partner(s) in the value chain. These partners can assist in directing the value chain towards identified or newly emerging market demands.
Proposals must include a sustainable end-of-life phase. This means that the targeted end-product must be either fully recyclable, degradable, or compostable under specified conditions [2].
Proposals may include any processing technology that has been demonstrated in an optimised value chain at TRL 6-7 and should encompass all processing stages leading to intermediate and end products.
Proposals must address all the requirements for flagship actions shown in Table 3 of the Introduction.
The technology readiness level (TRL) at the end of the project must be 8.Proposals should clearly state the starting and end TRLs of the key technology or technologies targeted in the project.

It is considered that proposals requesting a maximum contribution of EUR 16 million would be able to address this specific challenge appropriately. However, this does not preclude the submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
[1] In contrast to the flagship topic BBI VC3.F1 – 2014, this topic’s scope is to commercialise specifically the by-product lignin from existing lignocellulosic biorefineries that today finds no or low-value use. The scope of this topic also differs from that of the RIA topic BBI2020.SO2.R2, which is about developing a new processing scheme to valorise (the major part of) all fractions of lignocellulose, whereas F1 focuses on lignin alone. Moreover, the topic is different from the flagship topic BBI 2017.F1, whose scope was indeed to valorise all fractions of the feedstock (not necessarily lignocellulosic biomass) targeting a ‘zero waste’ biorefinery.

Bio-based operations often deal with variable or even unpredictable conditions (e.g. weather, geographical differences, pathogens) affecting the overall resource efficiency of the targeted value chains. Proper planning of bio-based operations must take into account multiple inputs on soil conditions, biodiversity, logistics, resources management, etc. There are many enabling technologies that promote smarter, safer, more efficient and more environmentally friendly bio-based value chains. These technologies include: ‘big data’, geographic information systems, sensors, artificial intelligence, the internet of things, and prediction algorithms. The technologies can also assist the bio-based industry to better evaluate quality and availability of (residual) biomass as feedstock for bio-based operations. Consequently, the bio-based industry can better plan its feedstock supply and align its operational steps accordingly.
The technologies mentioned above will also help bio-based operators to adapt and fine-tune the technological steps in pre-treatment, conversion and downstream processing.
The specific challenge is to increase biomass availability, resource efficiency and sustainability for the bio-based industry through enabling (advanced and innovative) technologies.

Efficiently integrate enabling technologies into bio-based operations to optimise value chains from a technical, economic, social and environmental point of view.
Proposals must deliver a logistical and technological scheme that will increase the supply of suitablequality feedstock to optimise bio-processing operations throughout the year. The scheme will also lower biomass losses from feedstock supply through the processing stages of the value chain; and allow a longer storage time before processing through more efficient pre-treatment steps and storage methods to better preserve the valuable components.

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
The full recyclability of composites through the effective separation and recovery of their components is still an issue. This is mainly due to the adhesives used to bind the different layers and materials together. The fossil-based bonding components that are currently used cannot easily be separated from the other components, nor can they be recycled together with the matrix material.
Industry can improve the recyclability of composites by designing bio-based bonding materials that will decompose [1] under specific conditions (e.g. pH, temperature, microorganisms). These new bonding materials will replace fossil-based counterparts in composites and allow multilayer plastics and composites to be recycled more easily.
A useful concept when considering recyclability is ‘extended producer responsibility’ (EPR) [2]. EPR makes manufacturers of composites – or any product – responsible for the entire life cycle of the product, especially for the take-back, recycling and final disposal. EPR is crucial for creating a sustainable and circular bioeconomy. EPR will be an important input to some quickly expanding application areas, such as 3D printing of cellulose-based materials, which offers new opportunities for regional industries.
The specific challenge is to increase the recyclability of composites.

Scope:
Develop bio-based bonding materials for composites to promote the separation of these composites into their components and thus make them more recyclable.
The scope of this topic is to develop degradable bonding materials for composites, and to design and develop adequate materials for composites themselves to maximise their recyclability.
The scope of this topic includes attempting to recycle multilayer fibrous materials that are used in many market applications, including the construction industry. Proposals should include EPR considerations for a sustainable end of life of these materials.
The scope also includes: (i) novel research into the origin of fibre materials used in composites; and (ii) searching for the optimum combination of bonding materials to maximise the recyclability of composites.
Since the recyclability of materials can only benefit from the availability of suitable recycling facilities and capabilities, proposals must include a description of a system/method to process the recyclable material.
Proposals are also expected to draft guidelines for collecting and directing the recyclable materials to these facilities. These guidelines must also include optimal ways for handling and pre-treating (if needed).

There is a strong continuing interest in obtaining high-value, sustainable, bio-based ingredients from new and alternative sources. These sources include under-exploited, ‘recalcitrant’ (i.e. requiring innovative processes/technologies to handle) side streams containing bioactive compounds with high market potential.
Currently, there is great demand for bio-based bioactive compounds in market sectors such as food, feed, performance chemicals, cosmetics, nutraceuticals, pesticides and pharmaceuticals. This trend is driven by consumer demand for functional products with ever-better performance, and for ‘natural’ and sustainable products.
Extracting bioactives from diverse sources brings challenges. These challenges include finding appropriate methods for the pre-treatment, handling and processing of raw materials and for properly characterising their diverse bioactive contents. In addition, the extraction processes themselves should be environmentally sustainable and economically viable while simultaneously preserving the functions and qualities of the targeted compounds.
The specific challenge is to develop appropriate processing schemes to extract bioactives from new, under-exploited and/or recalcitrant residual streams so they can be used in high-value-added applications.
Scope:
Develop suitable processing schemes to extract and process bioactive compounds from new, underexploited and/or recalcitrant side streams [1].
The scope of this topic includes new, under-exploited and/or recalcitrant side streams from various sources. These sources can be agricultural, food-related, forest-based, marine, aquatic, fish-based, biowaste-based, or any combination of these. Proposals should apply a cascading approach.

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Packaging is key to sustaining the quality and durability of consumer and industrial products through their lifespan. Today, most packaging materials are fossil-based and may cause environmental problems at the end of their life cycle if not properly managed.
For example, oxo-plastics (also called oxo-degradable plastics) are used in agricultural films, rubbish bags, carrier bags, food packaging and landfill covers. However, they break down into very small particles, potentially contributing to environmental (soil, marine, air) contamination by microplastics [1] [2]. And not all biodegradable packaging materials disintegrate quickly enough to avoid becoming marine litter or contaminating the soil [3].
With its 2018 plastics strategy, the European Commission has laid out plans to: (i) make all plastic packaging on the EU market recyclable by 2030; (ii) reduce single-use plastics; and (iii) restrict the intentional use of microplastics. Products made from oxo-degradable plastics will be banned from the EU market from July 2021.
Industry can develop and produce bio-based packaging materials that enable better functional performance than their fossil-based counterparts. This improved performance can be improved gas barrier functionality; longer shelf lives for food-packaging applications; and better consumer safety features. In addition, bio-based packaging materials can be made reusable or recyclable in applications that demand recyclability for a sustainable end-of-life. For other applications, bio-based packaging material that outperforms fossil-based alternatives can be made biodegradable22, industry- or homecompostable, or degradable in specific environments if this feature is demanded. These features may be desirable for applications such as food packaging. If a packaging material contains food remains after use, it cannot always be recycled as part of recyclable plastic streams. Making packaging material for specific food applications compostable will allow it to be collected together with food waste and to be composted, thus diverting it from landfill or incineration.
The specific challenge is to upscale the production of sustainable and high-performing bio-based packaging solutions that do not create environmental damage during and after use.

Scope:
Produce innovative, high-performance bio-based packaging material with sustainable end-of-life properties at demonstration level, the performance of which is superior to fossil-based alternatives and to existing bio-based material such as paper [4].
Proposals should address only one of the following two objectives.
They must produce superior, reusable or recyclable, bio-based plastic solutions for a specific application that demands reusability or recyclability as the best end-of-life option to prevent environmental damage. The targeted bio-based plastic solutions must be integrated in a circular value chain operating at demonstration level.
OR
They must produce superior bio-based plastic solutions that are biodegradable [5], industry compostable, home-compostable or degradable in specific environments. These solutions must be superior for a specific application that demands degradability/compostability as the best end-of-life option to prevent environmental damage. The targeted bio-based plastic solutions must be integrated in a circular value chain operating at demonstration level.
Proposals in either of the above options must therefore demonstrate and prove both:
superior performance compared with fossil-based alternatives in comparable applications;
a sustainable end-of-life causing no damage to the environment.
Achieving both these objectives will pave the way to improved consumer perception and greater consumer acceptance of bio-based solutions.
The demanded proof should meet accepted standards for performance, recyclability and degradability/compostability.
The scaled-up solutions must comply with all applicable regulations (e.g. for food or cosmetics packaging), and with safety regulations in particular.
Proposals should include waste-management actors as beneficiaries for the design of the value chain, including in the end-of-life phase. This is a necessity if the developed packaging solution does not integrate into existing waste-management infrastructure.
Proposals must address all the requirements for demonstration actions shown in Table 3 of the Introduction of the 2020 Annual Work Plan.
The technology readiness level (TRL) at the end of the project should be 6-7. Proposals should clearly state the starting and end TRLs of the key technology or technologies targeted in the project.
INDICATIVE FUNDING:
It is considered that proposals requesting a maximum contribution of EUR 7 million would be able to address this specific challenge appropriately. However, this does not preclude the submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
[4] Several topics in the past AWPs (e.g. BBI 2016.R5 and BBI 2018.SO3.R10) focused on ‘improved packaging solutions’, but this is the first time that such theme is addressed at a demonstration level.

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Coatings are widely used in many applications, such as in glass, concrete, metal and furniture. Depending on the specific performance required by the intended applications, coatings must serve different purposes. These purposes include preventing reflectivity, self-cleaning, protection, waterproofing, fire resistance, anti-corrosion, insulation and anti-fouling.
Because of this diverse and expanding range of requirements, people increasingly demand sustainable coatings. As part of this development, producers are introducing bio-based alternatives in coating formulations, replacing fossil-based compounds. Some of these fossil-based compounds (e.g. some solvents[1]) present potential health risks to humans.
The specific challenge is to substitute fossil-based compounds in coatings with bio-based alternatives, while ensuring that the performance of the coating is at least identical to the traditional coating.
[1] See e.g. https://www.uscoatings.com/blog/water-based-coating-vs-solvent-based-coating/
Scope:
Develop fully or partly bio-based coatings that guarantee at least all required performances of the intended applications [2] .
Proposals should develop at least one coating that can be: (i) tested in specific applications; and (ii) perform better than the baseline of existing coating formulations. Proposals should also address possible end-of-life scenarios for products in these application fields, including potential for recycling.
The scope of this topic includes the possibility of substituting traditional additives with enzyme-based additives [3] .
Proposals should include test results of the developed coating formulations to prove their benefits.
The scope of this topic includes: (i) physical changes for the targeted coatings; and (ii) microorganisms and bio-based molecules as bio-based components for the targeted coatings.
Proposals must include proof of the biological, chemical and mechanical stability of the coatings. For proposals that use microorganisms, this proof must pay particular attention to the control of microbial growing conditions, for example in humid environments.
Proposals should also include considerations about the safety of consumers and end-users of the targeted final application for the developed coatings. Any potential hazards associated with the developed processes and products should be analysed to check that the products will comply with EU legislation on chemicals risk management, toxicity and safety requirements.
Proposals should address all the requirements for RIA shown in Table 3 of the Introduction of the 2020 Annual Work Plan.
The technology readiness level (TRL) at the end of the project should be 4-5 and not exceeding 5. Proposals should clearly state the starting and end TRLs of the key technology or technologies targeted in the project.
INDICATIVE FUNDING:
It is considered that proposals requesting a contribution of between EUR 2 million and EUR 5 million would be able to address this specific challenge appropriately. However, this does not preclude the submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
[2] The topic differs both from the topic BBI VC1.R3 in AWP 2015, which entailed lignocellulosic biomass as starting feedstock, and from the topic BBI 2016.R5, whose focus was on smart food packaging. Moreover, the topic is more specific and more demanding than the similar topic BBI 2018.SO3.R9, which attracted many proposals, but resulted in only one granted project.

","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Lignin and hemicellulose are mostly treated as low-quality, low-value side streams of lignocellulose fractionation. However, both lignin and hemicellulose are some of the most abundant raw materials — and a potential feedstock — for the bio-based industry. They could play a crucial role in promoting the regional supply and refinement of sustainable biomass feedstock for both existing and new value chains. Several high-value and moderate-value applications of lignin and hemicellulose have already been demonstrated. And both lignin and hemicellulose are potentially already available in large quantities from existing operations. However, it remains a challenge to raise their quality to suitable levels for further processing in an affordable resource-efficient way. To do so, it will be necessary to identify specific, sustainable and economically attractive applications. It will also be necessary to specify the required quality aspects of lignin and hemicellulose to help promote commercialisation.
For example, lignin has enormous potential as a feedstock for aromatics. However, turning it into a feedstock for bio-aromatic value chains requires chemical reactivity for further processing. Technologies to convert hemicellulose are advancing. Some of these technologies use conversion methods such as fermentation. However, the feedstock must be of adequate quality, and further developments in yeast strains able to transform hemicellulosic sugars are needed. Moreover, new high-volume applications are essential to create a large enough outlet for the large stream of hemicellulose becoming available. Industry is interested in using both lignin and hemicellulose as feedstock for new bio-based value chains.
The specific challenge is to break up lignocellulose into its components to create value for most of all fractions (not only cellulose) in identified applications.
Scope:
Develop integral processing technologies to fractionate lignocellulose and deliver components of sufficient quality to be transformed into established or newly emerging high-value applications [1] .
The scope of this topic focuses on the development of an integral fractionation process to produce good-quality cellulose (the main product) and lignin and hemicellulose (the by-products) for established or newly emerging market applications. The scope excludes processes that create ethanol as an end-product.
In addition to the separation of high-quality cellulose, proposals must also include the separation and purification of lignin and hemicellulose to a sufficiently high quality so they can be turned into intermediates or end-products. The developed processes must be designed so that they can be readily scaled up.
Proposals must give convincing evidence of their innovative nature, and they must be complementary to the projects already funded by the BBI JU.
Proposals must always include the proof that the main product cellulose is of high quality (with a market value exceeding EUR 700 per ton) to serve as the basis for a profitable total business case.
Successful proposals will identify market applications for value chains based on lignin and on hemicellulose. These value chains will determine the required quality of the lignin and hemicellulose fractions. Proposals must also achieve this quality in an optimal way with a proper balance between higher-value/lower-volume products and lower-value/higher-volume products. The targeted market sectors can be any, except energy, and proposals should include actors in the related market sector(s).
Proposals should also include options for the consumption of chemicals, their recovery and re-use in the selected processes. They should also describe the recycling potential of the target applications after use.
Proposals should also consider how to turn residual amounts of the feedstock into other added-value applications such as for soil-improvement or bioenergy. The topic excludes, however, energy carriers as the main products, even if used as energy input into the process itself.
Proposals should address all the requirements for RIAs shown in Table 3 of the Introduction of the 2020 Annual Work Plan.
The technology readiness level (TRL) at the end of the project should be 4-5 and not exceeding 5. Proposals should clearly state the starting and end TRLs of the key technology or technologies targeted in the project.
INDICATIVE FUNDING:
It is considered that proposals requesting a contribution of between EUR 2 million and EUR 5 million would be able to address this specific challenge appropriately. However, this does not preclude the submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
[1] The scope of this RIA topic differs from that of the flagship action topic BBI2020.SO1.F1. This topic is about developing a new processing scheme to make use of most of all the fractions of lignocellulose, whereas F1 focuses on lignin only and aims at upscaling proven processes to enable the use of lignin on a commercial scale.

","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Start-ups and spin-offs, both young, innovative and entrepreneurial, often face big hurdles in attracting investors, or using financial instruments to help finance their business plans. They find it especially challenging in bio-based industries, as the hurdles to success are high, and investors find it more difficult to judge the associated risks. These risks are different compared with more familiar sectors like e.g. the digital sector. Entrepreneurs in the bio-based industry must cross extra hurdles to attract investors and become independent as soon as possible.
One of the ways to overcome these hurdles is by seeking out networking opportunities through suitable organisations, clusters [1] and platforms. These opportunities can bring start-ups and spin-offs into contact with large enterprises, regional clusters, open-innovation scale-up facilities, reference customers and other market actors. This will make start-ups and spin-offs more visible, allowing them to secure financing from the contacts them made.
The specific challenge is to help start-ups and spin-offs to improve their networking activities with relevant stakeholders and help to improve their business case and to gain access to funding opportunities in the bio-based sector.
[1] For example, see the European Cluster Observatory — this single access point may facilitate matches and possibly lead to new funding opportunities.
Scope:
Explore and quantify the needs of start-ups and spin-offs in the bio-based sector for specific financial and business advice. Explore also the feasibility of meeting these needs by an interactive platform or any other adequate system.
Proposals must develop and validate a methodology to qualify and quantify the needs of start-ups and spin-offs. On this basis, proposals must evaluate the interest of the spin-offs and start-ups to interact with potential partners and investors. And similarly, proposals must evaluate the interest of expert companies, organisations and investors to interact with start-ups and spin-offs.
Proposals must show that the envisaged platform or system will bring start-ups and spin-offs in contact with potential partners across networks and with a large geographical reach. Proposals should build on completed and running projects, such as networks of pilot plants [2] or other projects designed to facilitate access to financing.
Proposals must connect with all available financing instruments on a European level, including relevant regional instruments. Proposals must also describe how they plan to complement the ongoing activities of bodies such as the European Innovation Council, the Circular Bioeconomy Investment Platform, and the Enterprise Europe Network.
Proposals must also connect with the finance platform currently being designed by BIC and to be launched by the end of 2019. The new BIC platform will aim in particular to help SMEs obtain financing for scaling up the commercialisation of bio-based technologies and products on a pilot scale.
The scope of this topic includes all start-ups and spin-offs in the bio-based sector, and is not limited to BIC members or activities, nor is it limited to spin-offs or start-ups resulting from BBI JU projects. In order to consider also actors in the primary sectors, it is recommended to foster the role of advisors and innovation brokers to support (‘speak on behalf of’) these actors during the project implementation.
Proposals must therefore be based on a feasible business model to create and sustain it for at least 10 years after the end of the project. The model must include estimates of costs for setting up, launching and — particularly — maintaining and updating the platform in the abovementioned period beyond the project’s runtime.
Participation is encouraged from organisations that have previously managed entrepreneurship programmes targeting start-ups and spin-offs.
Indicative funding:
It is considered that proposals requesting a maximum of EUR 1.5 million and for a planned duration of not more than 3 years would be able to address this specific challenge appropriately. However, this does not preclude the submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts or for other durations.

","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Fully developed and sustainable biorefineries at an industrial scale require optimal valorisation of side streams generated during the different process steps. However, current practice is to divert these streams to low-value applications such as energy and fuels. Valorising these streams for higher-value applications requires further downstream processing steps. In some cases, within a cascading set-up of biorefining operations, the subsequent side streams could have a complex composition that makes it increasingly difficult to process them into valuable products.
The better this cascading operational set-up is at valorising subsequent liquid and solid side streams, the higher its competitiveness and sustainability will be. Resolving these challenges of downstream valorisation will potentially result in additional and new supplies of biomass feedstock for conversion into chemicals and materials.
This integrated approach will also create opportunities to enhance cooperation between different actors along and across the value chains, from biomass suppliers to biorefinery operators and market actors.
The specific challenge is to valorise liquid and solid biorefinery side streams with a composition that impedes their further processing into high added-value products beyond the state-of-the-art.
Scope:
Demonstrate sustainable and cost-efficient processing technologies for converting side streams and co-products from bio-based operations into high added-value products and hence increase the supply of biomass feedstock.
Proposals should focus on streams that are currently too expensive to convert (such as diluted streams that need to be concentrated) and/or those without an established conversion route to high-value products. Several kinds of bio-based operations could be considered within the scope of this topic, including biorefining in various sectors and at different industrialisation levels, as well as bio-waste treatment. Proposals should deliver a complete conversion set-up, which should be either separate and interconnected or integrated in the primary plant. Proposals should prove that the resulting products have a significant market value, high enough to justify the development of new value chains based on the exploitation of currently un- or under-exploited streams from bio-based operations. In this framework, proposals should show that the developed process is sustainable from an economic and environmental point of view and provide appropriate business models. The valorisation of the side streams and co-products should target chemicals and materials. Proposals should address side streams and co-products in liquid, solid, sludge or ash state (gaseous streams are the subject of topic BBI 2017.R1). Proposals should demonstrate the innovativeness of the proposed solutions, starting from technologies already proven at smaller scales. These may differ depending on the feedstock to be treated and the type of the intended bio-based operation.
Proposals should specifically demonstrate the benefits versus the state-of-the-art processing schemes and existing technologies in terms of feedstock and energy efficiencies. This could be done by providing evidence of new processing solutions and new products obtained.
The Technology Readiness Level (TRL)1 at the end of the project should be 6-7. Proposals should clearly state the starting and target TRLs. The proposed work should enable the technology to achieve the target TRL within the timeframe of the project.
Proposals should include an environmental and economic assessment using Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) methodologies. Proposals should also include a viability performance check of the developed process(es) and products based on available standards, certification, accepted and validated approaches.
Indicative funding: It is considered that proposals requesting a contribution of maximally EUR 7 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude the submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.

","15 April 2020
","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Due to its cross-sectoral nature and (relative) novelty, the bio-based industry requires a set of skills and competencies that are not available in some regions, but that are available — and taught — in certain academic and vocational schools.
Part of the process of closing the skills gap is increased cooperation between industry and the academic world. In some countries and regions, there is already interaction between the bio-based industry, academia and government. This cooperation occurs in training or innovation centres that mostly focus on joint projects or initiatives. In some regions, these centres also have education projects to meet industry’s future needs for skills, and to meet the training needs of the existing workforce. The existing centres typically focus on their regional situation and needs, benefiting local SMEs in particular. There is very little coordination between existing centres.
Industry would like bio-based ‘education centres’ to interact with education institutions on the skills that will be needed in the future, and on the skills that are needed by the existing workforce. Also, although regional centres focus on local needs, connecting these centres to each other will help them to draw up a common framework of standards and skills that could be tailored for local application. Increasing interaction in this way will also benefit the society at large and the bioeconomy in general.
The specific challenge to increase cooperation between the bio-based industry and the education system to avoid skills and competences gaps.
Scope:
Determine the criteria and conditions for bio-based education centres to create dynamic ecosystems that include industry, education institutions, governments, and society. These ecosystems should operate at local, regional and/or national levels.
The scope of this topic includes specifying the need for these centres and testing their feasibility as regards their design, setting-up, running and maintaining, always together with the envisaged partners.
The scope does not include the actual setting up of such an education centre and running it.
Proposals must state the appropriate level (regional, municipal, national etc.) for a bio-based education centre, taking into account the different educational systems across Europe. Proposals should also take into account the different levels of bio-based industry activities, bio-based industry potential, and bio-based industry strategies. Therefore, proposals must design bio-based education centres in at least three different regions/Member States in Europe, preferably one in each of: (i) north-west Europe; (ii) central and eastern Europe; and (iii) Mediterranean Europe. Proposals must also work with relevant partners in the selected regions and test this design with them and with regional stakeholders from industry, academia, government and civil society.
Proposals must include processes, structures and governance plans for bio-based education centres to deliver the needed curricula in vocational and academic settings. In addition, they must contain plans for life-long-learning programmes for the existing workforce. Proposals must also include communication channels to industry and society at large.
When designing bio-based education centres, proposals should investigate the feasibility and usefulness to cooperate with digital innovation hubs40 that deal with specific bio-based challenges and value chains. This cooperation and interlinking could allow the education centres to benefit from existing programmes and provide a holistic approach (education, technology, business) for the bio-based industrial sector.
Proposals must also include the considerations of necessary actions for sustaining bio-based education centres once they are up and running. These actions must include: (i) plans for a governance structure; (ii) a realistic budget for running and maintaining the education centre (at local, regional and/or national level); and (iii) a financial plan for its funding in the short and long term.
Proposals must also include guidelines for connecting bio-based education centres across Europe and creating EU added value. One example of the added value the proposal could bring is the provision of a common framework of standards and skills, tailored and complemented as needed for application at local levels. This network should align with other programmes on education to avoid duplication of work. These other programmes include action 2.4 in the updated bioeconomy strategy on education and skills; the European cooperation in science and technology actions; and the sector skills alliances of the Erasmus+ programme, the ‘bioeconomy skills gap analysis’ and the ‘bioeconomy university curricula’ from the Horizon 2020 Societal Challenge 2 call 2020.

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
The circular economy aims to maintain the value of products, materials and resources for as long as possible by returning them into the product cycle at the end of their use, while minimising the generation of waste [1]. The bioeconomy covers all sectors and systems that rely on biological resources (animals, plants, microorganisms and derived biomass, including organic waste), their functions and principles [2].
The circular economy is a concept that has been promoted for more than 20 years [3]. It brings together many interest groups, including stakeholders from the processing industry, waste management industry, recycling industry and others. In the early 1990s, several European countries began passing waste-related laws and regulations, which prompted the European Waste Framework Directive in 2008. New EU waste rules approved in May 2018 [4] require more rigorous enforcement of the waste hierarchy and introduce new requirements for waste management in the European Union.
With the bioeconomy becoming a reality, new interests have come into play, such as those focused on making use of waste streams or residual streams that so far have not been used, or that have only been used for burning as fuel.
This emergence of new interests can lead to potential conflicts of interests or at least to divergences of views as regards strategies to adopt. Some stakeholders focus on waste disposal (via landfill, incineration, etc.). Others focus on waste avoidance (e.g. by using renewable resources, utilising side streams). And others focus on using the materials found in waste. For this last category, regulations preventing the use of waste as a feedstock for other products, or preventing the moving of waste across borders, can be a hurdle. Changes in the waste hierarchy lead to conflicts between different stakeholders. The same conflict can arise when diverting biogenic waste streams from use in power-and-heat generation and composting to bio-based operations for material use.
The description and visualisation of circular economy as a concept mostly refer to the ‘two-winged butterfly’ by the Ellen MacArthur Foundation [5]. Recent discussions on circular bioeconomy lead to different and evolving positions by several actors [6].
It is therefore important to gain an insight into the different interests held by stakeholders about the end-of-life stage for materials. This will make it easier to find ways of moving towards a bioeconomy that fully uses the resources from the circular economy and fully contributes to a circular bioeconomy.
The specific challenge is to reconcile legislation, waste management, circularity and the bioeconomy.

Scope:
Gain insight into EU, national and regional regulations on waste management; map the interests of different stakeholders in this field; and bring these stakeholders together to recommend steps to support the circular bioeconomy.
The scope of this topic includes ‘bio-based waste’: residual streams that could serve as feedstock for the bio-based industry. Waste-water sludges are excluded from this topic.
Proposals must analyse whether and how EU waste directives and regulations/policies on the circular economy are implemented on a Member State level [7]. They need to take into account that national and regional regulations differ. They may use successful national/regional regulations as best practices. Proposals must analyse whether industry is already adapting to these regulations, and if so how and where they are adapting. Proposals must analyse where bio-based products or processes can benefit from these regulations. Proposals should identify regulatory hurdles for circular use of bio-resources.
Proposals should include industry sectors as well as large and small companies to understand their approach. This would be helpful because in some cases industry acts ahead of regulation (e.g. single-use plastics, and microplastics in home care). Proposals should also include public sectors dealing with, for example, waste management, environmental protection and monitoring, and territorial resources management planning.
Proposals should identify gaps in end-of-life scenarios for materials. These gaps could be either where current regulation is insufficient, or where it only combats symptoms instead of resolving a problem holistically. Proposals should give feedback on these gaps to the stakeholders and draw up recommendations for how to resolve these situations.
Proposals should also make recommendations on how regulations can transpose the EU directives into Member State law, while sustainably supporting the development of a circular bioeconomy.
INDICATIVE FUNDING:
It is considered that proposals requesting a maximum of EUR 1 million and for a planned duration of not more than 2 years would be able to address this specific challenge appropriately. However, this does not preclude the submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts or for other durations.

","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
In a context of growing demand for resources, sustainably capturing the potential of the seas, oceans and inland waters is critical for Europe. Micro- and macro-algae represent an additional source of biomass that can be used for various applications. They also have the advantage of a low land requirement. The production of farmed aquatic plants, including mostly macro-algae, is presently estimated at 23.8 million tonnes (wet weight 2012) and growing1.
Different cultivation systems to grow algae include open-sea, shallow-water, coastal areas and inland waters. There are specific systems for micro-algae like open ponds, photoreactors or bioreactors. Each system requires specific adaptation to its environment to maximise the biomass output, while minimising environmental impact (for example effluents, land use) and ensuring appropriate value chain logistics and conversion processes.
The specific challenge is to set up and operate a value chain for (micro- or macro-) algae production and logistics (harvest, transportation, storage) that can be used for their multi-valorisation into added-value chemicals and materials, through a cascading approach where applicable.
1 FAO, 2014, The State of World Fisheries and Aquaculture
Scope:
Demonstrate the efficient operation of a full value chain based on micro- or macro-algae that produces valuable products (such as ingredients or additives, advanced materials, etc.).
Proposals should include:
demonstration of efficient production systems, coupled with relevant pre-treatment steps to achieve a stable intermediate product ready for the conversion steps; and
multi-valorisation of micro- or macro-algae into advanced materials and/or specialty products, or high-value bulk products for different application sectors.
Proposals should include fully efficient logistics solutions to minimise biomass losses and reduce costs associated with harvesting, first pre-treatment steps, storage and transportation of the algal biomass to the processing sites. Proposals should therefore achieve cost reductions in biomass production and harvesting in a sustainable way, since these are essential for the further development and scale-up of the algal bioeconomy sector. A thorough assessment of the ecosystem risk should be carried out if the harvest takes place in the wild. Resource efficiency should be high through valorising all fractions arising from biomass processing.
Proposals should specifically demonstrate the benefits versus the state-of-the-art and existing technologies. This could be done by providing evidence of new processing solutions and new products obtained. Proposals should include a techno-economic evaluation of the proposed concepts to check also the economic viability as compared with existing solutions, comprising also a supply chain analysis, a market analysis and appropriate business models.
The Technology Readiness Level (TRL)1 at the end of the project should be 6-7. Proposals should clearly state the starting and target TRLs. The proposed work should enable the technology to achieve the target TRL within the timeframe of the project.
Proposals should include an environmental and economic assessment using Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) methodologies. Proposals should also include a viability performance check of the developed process(es) based on available standards, certification, accepted and validated approaches.
Indicative funding: It is considered that proposals requesting a contribution of maximally EUR 7 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude the submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Farm commodity products such as fertilisers need to be made more sustainable and resource–efficient. This will help secure European arable land productivity while also boosting sustainability and resource efficiency of the farming practices. For many years,
mineral fertilisers have been used to intensify crop production to meet the food demand of a growing population. Mineral fertilisers represent 80 % of the market value of all fertilisers in the EU: they are manufactured from feedstock (such as phosphate rocks) imported from third countries or are based on energy-intensive production processes (for example nitrogen fertilisers), all of which are non-renewable resources.
At the time of drafting this Annual Work Plan, a new EU regulation on fertilising products1 was under discussion among the co-legislators with a view to setting common rules for CE-marked fertilising products and level the playing field between mineral and organic fertilising products. This regulation will offer an access to the single market to innovative fertilising products such as those derived from secondary raw materials, whereas they were until now limited to national markets. The legislative proposal also imposes safety requirements to all fertilising products and requires, for instance, coating materials used in certain controlled-release fertilisers to be bio-degradable.
The loss of nutrients with traditional fertilisers has indeed been combated by the introduction of Controlled-Release Fertilisers (CRFs), which can better match the plants’ need for the nutrients over time. However, the use of these CRFs involves the use of plastic polymers, which are not biodegradable and lead to an accumulation of plastic impurities in soil. The new EU regulation on fertilising products addresses the degradability of the coatings of CRFs by stipulating a 90 % conversion of the organic carbon into CO2 in maximum 24 months.
The specific challenge is therefore to concentrate on finding coating polymers that are compliant with the biodegradability parameter in compliance with law, while achieving the controlled release of nutrients in the best possible manner.
Improving the nutrient quality of soils can also be achieved by the application of plant biostimulants, including microorganisms. This could be done by either stimulating plant capacities to absorb nutrients present in the environment, including in air or in soils, by stimulating soil microbiota (known as the ‘prebiotic approach’), or by introducing microorganisms into soil to transform in situ the non-available nutrients present into forms that plants can absorb (known as the ‘probiotic approach’). However, these concepts need to be demonstrated in an industrially relevant environment for an efficient and expanded use throughout Europe.
Another specific challenge is to demonstrate the use of advanced bio-based fertilising products that meet EU rules and that increase the sustainability of fertilising practices and the productivity of the agriculture in Europe. These could be fertilisers from bio-based streams, fully biodegradable coatings for CRFs or the smart use of plant biostimulants, including microorganisms.
1 https://ec.europa.eu/transparency/regdoc/rep/1/2016/EN/1-2016-157-EN-F1-1.PDF
Scope:
Demonstrate the following three uses in value chains to improve the sustainability of fertilising products and practices in agriculture:
component materials in more sustainable fertilising products from local bio-based waste streams and co-products that fully comply with the proposed revised EU rules mentioned above and that can help to replace less sustainable fertilisers, including those currently imported;
efficient bio-based biodegradable coatings for CRFs that can meet the proposed regulatory requirements on biodegradability of coatings in soils;
prebiotic and/or probiotic solutions for tailored soil nutrient improvement.
The consortium should be prepared to adapt its tasks (via an amendment to the Grant Agreement) to the final requirements laid down in the EU fertiliser regulation after its adoption, if applicable.
The new bio-based fertilising products should ensure and maintain the sustainability of the soil-plant system, be environmentally friendly and without adverse public health issues, and meet current and proposed regulations and standards.
Proposals should provide data showing evidence of the sustainable availability of the feedstock sources (for example agricultural and agro-industrial waste, animal by-products, by-products of the agro-food industry or sewage sludges), also in view of a further scale-up of the technologies and processes developed.
Proposals should specifically demonstrate the benefits versus the state-of-the-art and existing technologies. This could be done by providing evidence of new processing solutions with higher feedstock and energy efficiencies and new products obtained in terms of sustainability performance.
The Technology Readiness Level (TRL)1 at the end of the project should be 6-7. Proposals should clearly state the starting and target TRLs. The proposed work should enable the technology to achieve the target TRL within the timeframe of the project.
Proposals should include an environmental and economic assessment using Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) methodologies.
Proposals should also include a viability performance check of the developed process(es) based on available standards, certification, accepted and validated approaches, as well as measurement and testing approaches allowing for coming regulatory compliance checks.
Moreover, proposals should also allow for pre- and co-normative research necessary for the needed product quality standards2.

2 The technical basis of a new standard is usually established through a programme of research termed Pre-Normative Research (PNR), i.e. research undertaken prior to standardisation (normalisation). Such research would be used to demonstrate the feasibility and reliability of the technique or process to be standardised and to investigate its limitations. Once the technique or process has been developed and its boundaries have been explored, then, for new and emerging areas of technology, it would be normal to prepare a 'pre-standard', such as a Publicly Available Specification (PAS) or Technical Specification (TS), to provide a document in a relatively short time frame for evaluation by potential users. The availability of a pre-standard provides a basis for further research, usually termed Co-Normative Research - i.e. research undertaken in conjunction with the standardisation process, to establish a statistical basis for the technique or process, in particular its reproducibility (same user), repeatability (different users) and uncertainty.

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
The worldwide demand for protein is progressively expanding due to strong growth in the world’s population. Improvements in the standard of living in large parts of the world are adding to the protein demand1. Forecasts to 2050 show that current protein availability will not be sufficient to meet protein demand for food purposes. At the same time, Europe is highly dependent on imports of protein-rich material for feeding livestock: about 70 % of the total amount required is imported. Already 60-70 % of global arable land is used for animal feed to meet animal protein demand1.
Consequently, the exploitation of new protein sources is necessary to meet the worldwide demand. European crops, together with residues and co-products from primary biomass cultivation, are valuable sources of proteins. Residues from animal processing, fisheries, aquaculture and algae industries also offer a potential, albeit currently underexploited, source of proteins. The bio-based industry could help to expand the production of protein-rich ingredients by valorising existing alternative sources from food/feed value chains and by taking full advantage of the successes of earlier (and ongoing) R&D and small-scale industrial operations.
The specific challenge is to demonstrate a large-scale, first-of-its-kind bio-based value chain producing sustainable, safe proteins sourced from alternative, sustainable sources (dedicated crops as well as residues), through a cascading approach where applicable2.

2 For a Research and Innovation Action on proteins see Topic BBI 2017.R4.
Scope:
Produce on a large-scale food- and/or feed-grade proteins from sustainable alternative sources, such as residual streams from agriculture, other biomass production and related residual streams (like aquaculture, fisheries, or seaweed), or food industry side streams.
Proposals should include the whole value chain from the feedstock supply to processing and production steps for the targeted high added-value products. All relevant technologies in the different steps are applicable, provided they have been already proven at a significant scale (preferably demonstration levels TRLs 6-7, but at least pilot plant level TRL 5).
Proposals should focus primarily on proteins for food and feed applications. However, proposals could also consider functional proteins and other applications that may make it possible to generate new incomes and hence increase the overall sustainability of the value chains. Proposals should include extra valorisation steps through an integrated biorefinery setup.
Proposals need to take into account legislative limitations over the origin of the biomass feedstock when dealing with proteins for human or livestock nutrition. Proposals should include an assessment on safety, quality and purity for the target products, comparing them with the current (imported) proteins used for the same applications and end-products.
Proposals should also provide sound business models showing that sustainably produced feedstock streams are available in Europe, allowing to increase protein production in Europe and to reduce the imports of protein-rich products.
Proposals should specifically demonstrate the benefits versus the state-of-the-art and existing technologies. This could be done by providing evidence of new processing solutions and new products obtained. Proposals should demonstrate the techno-economic feasibility of the large-scale deployment of sustainable and efficient European value chains for proteins production.
The Technology Readiness Level (TRL)1 at the end of the project should be 8. Proposals should clearly state the starting TRL. The proposed work should enable the technology to achieve TRL 8 within the timeframe of the project.
Proposals should include an environmental, an economic and a social assessment using Life Cycle Sustainability Assessment (LCSA) methodologies Proposals should also include aviability performance check of the developed process(es) based on available standards, certification, accepted and validated approaches.
Proposals need to build on existing standardisation documents and allow for the necessary pre-and co-normative research into the development of new standardisation documents and validated approaches.

Exhaust gases from bio-based operations (containing mainly CO2) can serve as feedstock for different types of processing into valuable products. Integrating Carbon Capture and Utilisation (CCU) technologies within bio-based processes could minimise process efficiency losses, achieve a significant greenhouse gas emission reduction (potentially leading to negative emissions), and improve process economics by obtaining chemical building blocks for added-value products.
Technologies to convert gaseous feedstock have already reached a pilot and even an industrial scale in the petroleum and petrochemical industries. However, their use in bio-based operations still requires further research for successful replication and scale-up.
The specific challenge is to achieve sustainable and scaleable conversion technologies for gaseous feedstock from bio-based operations into added-value products.
Scope:
Validate at pilot scale in an industrially relevant environment innovative technologies to efficiently convert gaseous feedstock from bio-based operations into useable chemical building blocks for products in added-value applications in various market segments.
Proposals should also aim at increasing the overall sustainability of bio-based value chains by stimulating industrial symbiosis with other sectors and creating conditions for the establishment of integrated biorefineries. This symbiosis could create new industrial sites or link existing sites to integrated biorefineries.
Proposals should focus on the valorisation of gaseous intermediate streams originating exclusively from bio-based operations. The technologies should enable capture and conversion of greenhouse gases (mainly CO2) into chemicals. Applied and effective solutions in other industrial sectors such as chemical, steel, cement, etc. could serve as benchmarks.
Although sources of these gases can be all bio-based operations, proposals should not address ‘purposely produced’ gaseous streams, unless these streams can serve to prove significant reductions of cost and environmental footprint as compared with alternatives.
Proposals may consider any technologies such as electrochemical, chemo-catalytic and bio-catalytic technologies as well as combinations of different technologies.
The industry should actively participate to prove the potential for integrating the developed concepts into current industrial landscapes or existing plants so that deployment of the concepts can be accelerated and scaled up to an industrial level.
Proposals should specifically demonstrate the benefits versus the state-of-the-art and existing technologies. This could be done by providing evidence of new processing solutions and new products obtained. The developed solutions should prove their innovativeness, efficiency and a high yield of the targeted products to guarantee the sustainability of their subsequent scale-up to demonstration level. Proposals should include a preliminary techno-economic evaluation of the proposed concepts to check also the economic viability as compared with existing solutions.

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Current large-volume products for market applications include fossil-based (for example conventional plastics) or bio-based (for example bio-based plastics and cotton) products, and their production often occurs at relatively low sustainability levels1. Due to the high market share and strategic role associated with these products, industry is increasingly pursuing technical solutions aimed at improving sustainability during their whole life cycle including end-of-life. Also, consumers and brand owners are pushing to tackle safety and environmental issues related to several consumer goods.
Sustainably produced bio-based large-volume products for a variety of applications would be one of the key drivers for accelerating and performing an effective transition towards a low-carbon society. However, some barriers still hinder this process, mainly because of issues over the cost, performance and social and environmental sustainability of the bio-based value chains and related products.
The specific challenge is to produce bio-based fibres and other bio-based materials able to efficiently compete with current benchmark counterparts for large-volume applications through better technical performance, lower cost and higher sustainability levels.

Scope:
Demonstrate the efficient and viable production of bio-based fibres and materials with superior technical performance and sustainability levels, but at lower production costs, in a whole value-chain approach. Their superior performance should be proven in comparison with identified benchmark materials (fossil-based or bio-based) for large-volume applications, using clear and pre-defined criteria. Benchmark counterparts should be both fossil-based and traditional bio-based products.
Proposals should target relevant properties in any market sectors of large-volume bio-based products, such as packaging, textiles, construction, agriculture, the automotive industry and personal care and hygiene. Proposals should consider feedstock from different European sources, including residual streams of several origins to produce the target bio-based materials. Proposals should demonstrate solutions that comply with the relevant regulations, existing standardisation documents and validated approaches to achieve the products’ subsequent marketability. The target product should comply with all safety, quality and purity requirements set by the EU and national authorities. Proposals should outline a strategy for deploying the targeted products on the market for large-volume applications. To this end, proposals should provide appropriate business models and marketing strategies. Proposals should also show the feasible, sustainable and economic supply of European biomass for these applications.
The Technology Readiness Level (TRL)1 at the end of the project should be 6-7. Proposals should clearly state the starting and target TRLs. The proposed work should enable the technology to achieve the target TRL within the timeframe of the project.
Proposals should include an environmental and economic assessment using Consequential2 Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) methodologies. Proposals should also include a viability performance check of the developed process(es) based on available standards, certification, accepted and validated approaches, as well as measurement and testing approaches allowing for coming regulatory compliance checks.
Indicative funding: It is considered that proposals requesting a contribution of maximally EUR 7 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude the submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.

Biorefineries converting feedstock into chemicals and materials will become the backbone of the future production of sustainable products. Such facilities combine several fundamental process steps, including the appropriate pre-treatment, conversion and downstream processes. One challenge has always been the efficient integration of all process steps.
Another significant challenge is to convert all fractions of the feedstock used in a biorefinery into chemicals and materials with the highest added value possible, to improve the profitability of the biorefinery.
The specific challenge is to utilise all fractions of the biomass feedstock to produce chemicals and materials, targeting ‘zero waste’ and a minimum diversion of carbon content streams to low-value uses.
Scope:
Demonstrate at industrial level a successful and profitable bio-based plant that converts all fractions of the feedstock primarily into chemicals and materials, through a cascading approach where applicable.
All biological and/or chemical routes or combinations of these routes are applicable, provided they have been already proven at a significant scale (preferably demonstration levels TRLs 6-7, but at least pilot plant level TRL 5). Proposals should target the complete utilisation of all fractions of the biomass feedstock, ideally leading to ‘zero waste’. The minimum target for converting the biomass into chemicals and materials is 95 % of its initial carbon content. Proposals should apply state-of-the-art metrics to assess the efficiency of the conversion system in terms of mass and energy inputs and outputs (see also LCA below). Proposals should aim to achieve industrial operation of the innovative processing stages to achieve full feedstock valorisation, and their integration into existing facilities. This will benefit efforts to maximise the return on investment of current assets and minimise capital expenditure. This integration will also help generate the knowledge and information needed to reduce risk in investments in future industrial-scale installations.
Proposals should specifically demonstrate the benefits versus the state-of-the-art and existing technologies. This could be done by providing evidence of new processing solutions and new products obtained.
The Technology Readiness Level (TRL)1 at the end of the project should be 8. Proposals should clearly state the starting TRL. The proposed work should enable the technology to achieve TRL 8 within the timeframe of the project.
Proposals should include an environmental, an economic and a social assessment using Life Cycle Sustainability Assessment (LCSA) methodologies. Proposals should also include a viability performance check of the developed process(es) based on available standards, certification, accepted and validated approaches. Furthermore, proposals should provide appropriate business models.

Proteins and bioactive compounds, such as carotenoids, polyphenols, lipid compounds and prebiotics, have extensive use as ingredients and additives in the food, feed, flavouring, fragrance, cosmetics, chemicals, textile, nutraceutical and pharmaceutical industries. The projected global demand for proteins and bioactive compounds in 2030 exceeds current production capacities1.
Residual biomass and side streams are potentially interesting sources of these ingredients. As proteins and bioactive ingredients have a typically high value per volume unit, recovering and commercialising them could achieve a sizeable economic benefit for the whole value chain. However, exploitation of these sources for obtaining proteins and bioactive ingredients is still at an early stage.
Some residual streams, such as the non-edible parts of plants, often contain anti-nutritional elements that are not easy to separate and consequently prevent their direct use in food. Other factors may also limit the regulatory compliance and consumer acceptance of food additives based on plant residues.
The specific challenge is to develop sustainable technologies to recover proteins and bioactive ingredients from feedstock or to convert residual biomass and industry side streams into ingredients for food, feed and other high-value markets. The challenge includes achieving the separation/extraction and purification (where applicable) of the proteins and bioactive ingredients to meet the required market specifications and regulations2.

Scope:
Validate (either at lab scale, or at pilot scale in an industrially relevant environment) a sustainable process to separate and/or convert proteins and bioactive compounds from residual biomass streams originating from biomass production (such as agriculture) and conversion (such as the food/feed industry and biorefineries). The proteins and targeted bioactive compounds have functional properties other than nutritional quality (in the case of food and feed) that are important for dedicated markets. In this context, separation/extraction and/or conversion processes must ensure that the products’ quality and properties are conserved. Proposals need to achieve the appropriate purity of the target molecules and performance in specific application fields to at least match the benchmark technologies.
The industry should actively participate to prove the potential for integrating the developed concepts into current industrial landscapes or existing plants so that deployment of the concepts can be accelerated and scaled up to an industrial level.
Proposals should provide a preliminary assessment of the availability of the sustainably produced feedstock used in the project, considering the possible upscaling of the developed processes.
Proposals should specifically demonstrate the benefits versus the state-of-the-art and existing technologies. This could be done by providing evidence of new processing solutions and new products obtained.

Proposals should include an analysis of the regulatory requirements and product specifications (like taste, nutritional value, genetic modification, solvent used) that may limit the market approval and acceptance of the targeted ingredients or additives. Proposals should also include specification of the health and safety aspects of the resulting products.

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Pre-treatment of biomass is a key step in implementing an economically viable biorefinery. The conventional methods of biomass pre-treatment mainly apply harsh conditions, consume much energy, require significant capital investments and generate inhibitors to the downstream biological processes. These methods can also harm many characteristics of naturally occurring polymers, often hindering their use for a large variety of applications. The ideal pre-treatment should lead to a higher ‘usability’ of the various biopolymers in the biomass feedstock (like cellulose and hemicellulose fractions in a lignocellulosic feedstock) in the subsequent steps, generate low amounts of inhibitory compounds, and limit biomass losses. This pre-treatment technology should also have a high efficiency when applied to different biomasses, require less energy and resources, have a low environmental impact and be economically viable.
The specific challenge is to develop pre-treatment technologies to separate and extract naturally occurring polymers and other useful fractions (for example extractives) of lignocellulosic and mixed biomass streams with complex composition, while keeping their structure essentially intact.
Scope:
Validate pre-treatment technologies at pilot scale in an industrially relevant environment to allow for the separation of natural bio-based polymers while keeping their main characteristics intact. The types of feedstock included in the scope are lignocellulosic biomass and mixed streams with a complex composition. Proposals should aim to develop technologies that:
increase the ‘usability’ of the holocellulose and/or other useful biopolymer fractions in the biomass feedstock by recovering at least 80 % of each for direct valorisation in specific applications and/or in the subsequent step of enzymatic hydrolysis, with a low generation of inhibitory compounds;
deliver ‘naturally occurring polymers’ with sufficient purity and quality for efficient processing in the following steps;
require less energy and resources and have a lower environmental impact than benchmark technologies currently applied to the same type of feedstock.
Proposals could consider chemical, physical or biotechnological solutions or feasible and sustainable combinations thereof. The developed processing routes should ensure reduction of biomass losses and efficient separation and recovery of other fractions of the treated biomass. Applying the cascading operational concept, these fractions can then also be further exploited.
The industry should actively participate to prove the potential for integrating the developed concepts into current industrial landscapes or existing plants so that deployment of the concepts can be accelerated and scaled up to an industrial level.

Cost considerations are to date the prime hindrance to market penetration of bio-based chemical products. The maturity of the petrochemical industry makes purely cost-based competition unrealistic for most bio-based alternatives. Moreover, even the availability of bio-based products with equivalent performance and at the same cost would not per se be sufficient to drive acceptance and utilisation by consumers and brand owners. A better performance at an acceptable premium price would increase the marketability of bio-based products for mass consumption. Bio-based feedstock gives the opportunity to produce chemical precursors1 that could outperform their fossil-based counterparts.
The specific challenge is to develop novel bio-based chemical precursors for mass consumption products that feature, at an acceptable cost, new functionalities or better performance than their fossil-based counterparts.

Plastics are an essential part of modern society, with applications in almost every product range.

4 The technical basis of a new standard is usually established through a programme of research termed Pre-Normative Research (PNR), i.e. research undertaken prior to standardisation (normalisation). Such research would be used to demonstrate the feasibility and reliability of the technique or process to be standardised and to investigate its limitations. Once the technique or process has been developed and its boundaries have been explored, then, for new and emerging areas of technology, it would be normal to prepare a 'pre-standard', such as a Publicly Available Specification (PAS) or Technical Specification (TS), to provide a document in a relatively short time frame for evaluation by potential users. The availability of a pre-standard provides a basis for further research, usually termed Co-Normative Research - i.e. research undertaken in conjunction with the standardisation process, to establish a statistical basis for the technique or process, in particular its reproducibility (same user), repeatability (different users) and uncertainty.

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Products derived from petrochemical feedstock have extensive downstream production routes, developed markets and an efficient infrastructure. Therefore, making the ‘same’ chemicals from biomass and ‘blending’ them into these existing value chains (known as ‘drop-in’ chemicals) is the quickest and most cost-effective way to implement bio-based value chains in the short term. However, there are some bio-based molecules without a ‘significant’ fossil counterpart1 that industry and researchers regard as promising in the medium to long term, due to their special functional properties or possible derivatives.
While the production processes for bio-based chemicals with no significant fossil-based counterpart could be made more economical and sustainable, there is as yet no infrastructure for their further use, making them less attractive for now.
Like petrochemical building blocks such as benzene and p-xylene, these bio-based building blocks (for example levulinic acid, muconic acid and hydroxy­methyl­furfuraldehyde) do not have direct applications, but are the basis for a wealth of other chemicals that can bring renewability and sustainability in many markets.
Technically, the production of those ‘primary’ bio-based building blocks is in many cases already at TRL 4-5 (see topic BBI 2017.D3). However, their conversion into ‘secondary’ products is often still at TRL 2-3, as there is a low level of insight into their applicability in existing fossil-based value chains. Aside from providing the proof of principle of the new functionality and performance of new secondary bio-based products, industry also needs to develop and validate sustainable production routes.
The specific challenge is to validate at lab or pilot level the production routes from primary bio-based building blocks to breakthrough bio-based chemicals with no significant fossil counterpart, and to show a proof of principle for the added value they bring to the market.
1 Molecules having no fossil-based production route, or whose fossil-based production route(s) – while technically possible – is not commercially pursued because of cost or sustainability issues.
Scope:
Validate (either at lab scale, or at pilot scale in an industrially relevant environment) a production process for bio-based chemicals with no significant fossil-based counterpart, resulting from primary bio-based building blocks. The primary building blocks must be obtained from sustainably sourced biomass of European origin.
Proposals should aim to validate a production route for at least one ‘secondary’ bio-based chemical building block that does not have a ‘significant’ fossil-based counterpart. The targeted building block should have the potential to drive the subsequent production of high added-value products in specific market sectors. In addition, proof of principle has to be shown for at least one application.
The new performance can be as a secondary building block for a variety of applications ranging from polymers and plasticisers to other intermediate building blocks. However, it can also have direct applications as lubricants, hydraulic fluids, solvents, pharmaceuticals and cosmetics.
Biotechnological processes could be effective for this purpose as microbial enzymes are highly selective and work in relatively mild conditions. This makes it possible to produce complex structures, while preserving existing functionalities. However, thermo- and chemo-catalytic processes also fall within the scope of this topic. They should ensure high reaction yields, high selectivity for the target product and high productivity levels. In this way, they will efficiently pave the way to a further scale-up of the developed process(es) to enable an expanding market entrance for products based on the chemical.
Proposals should justify the selection of the targeted molecules in terms of their intended application, with supporting economic quantification of the targeted markets. Proposals should also show the feasible, sustainable and economic supply of European biomass for these applications via the primary building block.
The industry should actively participate to prove the potential for integrating the developed concepts into current industrial landscapes or existing plants so that deployment of the concepts can be accelerated and scaled up to an industrial level.
Proposals should specifically demonstrate the benefits versus the state-of-the-art and existing technologies. This could be done by providing evidence of new processing solutions and new products obtained. Proposals should also deliver a preliminary economic feasibility study, providing the basis for upscaling the technology to an industrial level.
The Technology Readiness Level (TRL)1 at the end of the project should be 4-52,3. Proposals should clearly state the starting and target TRLs. The proposed work should enable the technology to achieve the target TRL within the timeframe of the project.
The compliance of the target molecules with all standards and regulations (including the REACH regulation) should be assessed, taking also into account their potential final applications.
Proposals should include an environmental assessment using Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) methodologies, and a cost analysis. Proposals should also include a viability performance check of the developed process(es) based on available standards, certification, accepted and validated approaches.
Indicative funding: It is considered that proposals requesting a contribution of EUR 2 million to maximally EUR 5 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude the submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.

2 TRL 5 requires that the technology be ‘validated in [a] relevant environment (industrially relevant environment in the case of key enabling technologies).’ For industry, this means at ‘pilot scale’ (meaning beyond and larger than ‘at lab scale’), preferably at an industrial site.

","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Getting biomass feedstock from its sources in rural1 and coastal areas to processing plants in the bio-based industry today has to contend with many hindrances. These relate to the (often varying) quality of the biomass, its quantity, location and distance from the operating facilities and state-of-the-art logistical systems and equipment.
Besides adding weight in transportation, high water content may cause the biomass to degrade during transportation and storage. Compacting or drying techniques to reduce weight, volume and moisture could modify the biomass composition and properties.
Also, residual biomass in particular often occurs in relatively small quantities in scattered locations, and its low value does not justify an efficient, modern logistical system for valorisation. Consequently, residues that are potential feedstock for the bio-based industry are left on the field or are burnt.
In many areas, too, the disconnect between actors in the rural and coastal areas and those in the bio-based operational stages prevents the introduction of new and innovative technologies and practices into the supply chain.
This lack of connection between the planning and resource management and downstream value chain operations often means that there is no business case for efficient integration of locally sourced feedstock with bio-based industry operations.
The specific challenge of this topic is to cost-effectively mobilise local biomass, from source to the gates of an advanced biorefinery, for further processing into value-added market applications, thereby avoiding losses in feedstock quantity or quality.
1 Rural areas include agricultural and forest areas, and also cover inland fisheries and aquaculture.
Scope:
Develop and demonstrate an efficient logistical system to mobilise (source and deliver) local and regional biomass to the gates of biorefining operations.
Proposals should address harvest and collection1, pre-processing, preservation, storage and transport of the biomass, aiming at an effective sourcing and delivery system with no or minimal losses due to biodegradation.
The delivered biomass should be ‘storage-stable’, of suitable quality and in adequate quantities for further processing. Proposals, therefore, should also include testing the biomass using existing or innovative standards or parameters and should address relevant safety aspects (see also introduction – section 2.2.5 - published in the BBI JU AWP 2018).
Proposals should reflect awareness of the objectives of running national and EU-funded projects2,3 in this field to avoid overlap.
This topic covers all types of biomass.
Both the centralised large-scale biorefining model and the dispersed small biorefining network model could be considered, or a combination of the two, depending on the local conditions of biomass sourcing and overall economics.
Proposals should include steps up to the processing steps in an integrated biorefining set-up. However, as they relate to an innovation action – demonstration topic, proposals must be based on an express demand for the subject biomass, leading to conversion into identified market applications. Proposals will thus consider the full value chain.
Proposals should include cost-efficient and easy to operate technical solutions, including the associated equipment to allow their use at the required location (in the rural areas). Active participation and partnership with actors in the primary sector (agriculture and forestry, fisheries and aquaculture) are therefore a must. Proposal should also address contractual or business arrangements between the feedstock producers/suppliers and the feedstock users to secure biomass supply.
Proposals may aim both to set up new bio-based value chains and to improve the feedstock logistics in existing bio-based value chains. In the latter case, proposals should develop and demonstrate breakthroughs and innovative improvements, rather than incremental improvements.
Proposals should be based on a sound business case and business plan.
Proposals should commit to assessing the environmental and economic impacts of the developed products or processes, using LCA methodologies based on available standards, certification, accepted and validated approaches (see also introduction – section 2.2.5 - published in the BBI JU AWP 2018)4. If applicable, proposals should also analyse the social impacts.
If relevant, proposals should also allow for pre- and co-normative research necessary for developing the needed product quality standards.
The technology readiness level (TRL )5 at the end of the project should be 6-7. Proposals should clearly state the starting TRL.
Indicative funding:
It is considered that proposals requesting a maximum contribution of EUR 7 million would be able to address this specific challenge appropriately. However, this does not preclude the submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
1 Also considering multi-modal harvest and transport systems, e.g. harvesters + lorry (including driverless lorries) + rail + canal/sea.
2 Such as INFRES (Innovative and effective technology and logistics for forest residual biomass supply in the EU); LogistEC (Logistics for Energy Crops' Biomass); Europruning (Development and implementation of a new, and non-existent, logistics chain for biomass from pruning); AGROinLOG (integrated biomass logistics centres for the agro-industry).

3 Such as those resulting from topic RUR-08-2016 ‘Demonstration of integrated logistics centres for food and non-food applications’.
4 The LCA may focus on a set of critical issues early on to steer the development process in the right direction. In this case, it is essential that this selection is carefully explained in the proposal in order to allow for expert assessment. See also in the introduction.

Expected Impact:
contribute to KPI 1: create at least one new cross-sector interconnection in bio-based economy;
contribute to KPI 2: set the basis for at least one new bio-based value chain;
increase the income for biomass producers involved in the supply chain, as well as creating new job opportunities in rural and coastal areas;
increase the overall resource efficiency;
decrease biomass losses by 40 %;
bring down transportation costs by 30 %;
bring about a 20 % decrease in greenhouse gas emissions, thanks to modified transportation and storage phases, optimised pre-processing steps, etc.;
increase the mobilisation rate 1 by 20 % 2.
Type of action: Innovation action – demonstration action.
1 Mobilisation rate means the amount of feedstock in theory that is sustainably available, or is ready to be sourced on a certain area (e.g. within a 100-km radius of the biorefinery), compared with the amount of feedstock that in reality can be sourced. The difference between these two amounts is due to an insufficient or non-existing logistics/mobilisation system.
2 The proposal should present a convincing justification of the calculation of this rate, based on established econometric models and statistical data.

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
In 2016, an estimated 54 % of the world’s population lived in urban areas. That figure is projected to exceed 60 % in 20302. Cities, and the people living within them, produce an immense amount of solid waste and wastewater.
Despite the widespread availability of sorting practices, mixed waste streams going to landfill or for incineration still contain a large volume of biodegradable organic matter (for example, 60 % in the UK3) that could well be used as feedstock for the bio-based industry. Furthermore, such a large amount of organic matter going to landfill falls short of the aim in Council Directive 1999/31/EC on the landfill of waste4 of limiting the share of landfilled biodegradable waste to 35 % by 2020.
Wastewater contains several valuable components, including cellulose and nutrients, especially phosphorus. The content of municipal wastewater and the derived sewage sludge could cover around 15 % of the world’s phosphorus demand5. Every year the average citizen sends 10 kg of toilet paper6 into the sewage system. This would provide an enormous source of cellulose for further upgrade to chemical precursors and/or polymers.
High dilution and the wide variety of exploitable components in urban wastewater streams make it difficult to recover usable components at higher scale efficiently. As a result, urban wastewater treatment tends to focus on producing energy or biogas.
Even though their contaminant levels and diversity present challenges for valorisation, organic urban waste streams can provide a significant volume of feedstock for the bio-based industry all year round without any conflict with land use and food production.
The specific challenge of this topic is to utilise mixed waste streams, separately collected organic waste and the organic fraction of sewage sludge from wastewater treatment – all coming from urban sources – as sustainable feedstock for the bio-based industry, overcoming their high dilution level, pollution and disparity of content.
1‘Urban bio-waste’: biodegradable garden and park waste, food and kitchen waste from households, restaurants, caterers and retail premises and comparable waste from food processing plants (definition of 'biowaste' in Directive 98/2008/EC on waste); urban waste water and sludge from its treatment

Scope:
Demonstrate effective, safe and efficient solutions to overcome dilution, pollution and diversity of content in different organic urban waste streams of urban origin and convert these into high value-added compounds for further use. These streams include mixed waste streams, separately collected organic waste, and the organic fraction of sewage sludge from wastewater treatment.
The scope is to tackle all constraints which today impede the conversion of such waste streams into chemical precursors, polymers, materials and/or fertilisers at yields that are promising for successful upscaling to pre-commercial levels. Energy or biogas valorisation is out of scope (see related paragraph below).
A cascade-type approach should be applied, aiming at valorising as much as possible of the target feedstock into a range of several products and materials. A flexible biorefinery concept should also be developed, to allow for the production of different end-products, depending on feedstock availability and features, seasonality, market demand, etc.
Proposals should address urban wastewater, separately collected organic waste, mixed solid municipal waste streams, or a combination thereof. They should focus on the technologies needed in processing target waste streams. Logistical steps and other arrangements with and within municipalities, while instrumental to the success of the project, must be considered as ‘additional activities’. Proposals should demonstrate the efficient preparation of mixed urban waste streams for valorisation into high value-added compounds. The successful application of these technologies should deliver biomass feedstock that can readily be further treated and produce large volumes of the desired compounds.
Proposals should also assess the technical feasibility and economics of wastewater containment systems to reduce leakage of for example methane. This assessment should also include high-volume filtration systems for the removal of useful chemical feedstocks such as phosphates.
Proposals should build on and seek to dovetail with the results from other finished or running projects that address the treatment of wastewaters and organic waste streams. Technologies used for the conversion of the organic fraction of municipal solid waste and/or wastewater should be different and new compared to those applied in the running projects1.
Although energy or biogas valorisation is out of the main scope of the topic, proposals could seek cooperation with existing waste2 and/or wastewater treatment plants including biogas reactors, targeting compounds and products that exceed state-of-the-art standards.
Proposals should involve waste management companies/agencies to ensure the availability of the appropriate urban waste streams. In addition, as they are aiming to create or improve value chains based on urban waste streams, proposals should involve end-users so that they can address public perception.
Proposals should be based on a sound business case and business plan, as well as an assessment of the market potential of the new compounds.
Proposals should commit to assessing the environmental and economic impacts of the developed products or processes, using LCA methodologies based on available standards, certification, accepted and validated approaches3 (see introduction – section 2.2.5 - published in the BBI JU AWP 2018). If applicable, proposals should also analyse the social impacts.
Proposals should also allow for pre- and co-normative research necessary for developing the needed product quality standards and for ensuring safety of the end-products.

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
The state-of-the-art approach to designing, scaling up and starting up bioprocesses is governed by ‘trial and error’ and replicating traditional manufacturing methods. These methods often cause scaling-up losses and start-up delays or failures. There are many variables that have an impact on the design and scaling-up of bioprocesses, making this a very complex exercise. Among the major causes of these variables are:
an increasingly wider range of biomass feedstock and their varied and heterogeneous composition; and
revolutionary developments in molecular biology producing more efficient microorganisms that can create a wider range of bio-products.
Both developments demand reliable modelling systems to cope with many variables in simulating the full value chain, from feedstock to products, in search of the most effective combinations.
The design phase should be long enough and have sufficient tools available to test different and radical concepts. And ultimately, in the scaled-up and (semi-)commercial operating phase, there should be guidelines for continuous improvement cycles.
Today’s methods for scaling-up often take a more limited view and do not look at the bigger picture, so that optimisation takes place at lab level, not at plant operation level.
Industry needs reliable modelling approaches, able to predict entire pathways from feedstock and energy intake to product output. This may mean designing tailor-made paths for each specific feedstock – from its intake and preparation, through the processing steps to the end-products.
Recent developments in computation-driven frameworks can help cope with many variables in designing optimal feedstock-organisms-bioprocess configurations and simulating scaling-up. These computation approaches are already standard in fields other than microbial technology and industrial biotechnology.
The specific challenge of this topic is to design and apply reliable and robust computational modelling approaches for bioprocesses.
Scope:
Develop modelling systems that contain experimental multi-omics data on microbial responses to conditions in large fermenters and that combine know-how of metabolic networks and large-scale fluid dynamics into an integral, computation-driven framework to help in the design, scale-up and start-up of bioprocesses.
The modelling approach should specify the ‘optimal’ use of the selected biomass – in terms of the environmental, economic and social sustainability of the value chain – and the resulting savings in cost and time during scaling-up and start-up. Proposals should therefore be developed in partnership with the operator of a (pre-)commercial-scale biorefinery or a pilot or demonstration plant, who should validate the results.
To achieve a fair assessment, adequate metrics will be needed to compare the results of modelling from different perspectives. The models should also make connectivity to Industry 4.0 and The Internet of Things possible for future use in a complete value chain.
Proposals should simulate a selected specific biomass feedstock and associated processing steps yielding targeted intermediary products.
Proposals may include different processing routes for the selected feedstock to show how the developed models may be replicated, scaled up and used in different value chains. This experimental validation should also include a sensitivity analysis to assess the models’ ability to cope with disruptions and non-uniform reaction mixtures. The validation should also specify all included assumptions and should yield information to quantify sensitivity and uncertainties alike.
The industry should actively participate to demonstrate the potential for integrating the developed concepts into current industrial landscapes or existing plants so that the concepts can be deployed more quickly and scaled up to apply industrial-wide.
Proposals should specifically demonstrate the benefits versus the state-of-the-art and existing technologies. This could be done by providing evidence of new processing solutions and new products obtained.
The technology readiness level (TRL)1 at the end of the project should be at least 3 for the bio-based value chain in question. Proposals should clearly state the starting TRL, which may be as low as 1 or 2.
Proposals should seek complementarity with projects funded under Horizon 2020 to avoid overlap, promote synergies and advance beyond the state-of-the-art.

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Biopesticides are pesticides derived from natural materials such as animals, plants, bacteria and certain minerals2.They can improve the management of pests for sustainable agricultural management programmes, by combatting only the targeted pest and closely related organisms, making them sometimes more selective than conventional pesticides. If in addition they are effective in small quantities and decompose quickly, they can greatly reduce the use of conventional (synthetic) pesticides.

The components that can be used to produce biopesticides have also anti-pathogenic capabilities: they are able to prevent biomass degradation by fungi, bacteria or other kinds of pathogenic agents. Upscaling their use for biopesticides requires sustainable supply and optimum production.

Sustainable agricultural management programmes also entail the supply of nutrients to crops. The existing supply of nutrients can be expanded and diversified by tapping side streams from bio-based operations. These streams are nutrient-rich and moreover, are a zero-ILUC (indirect land use change) feedstock for fertilisers3, nutrients and plant biostimulants. However, current practice is to spread them on the land with little pre-treatment. This practice is wasting a potentially valuable resource and is often not the most effective and efficient way to add nutrients and carbon to the soil. Further development work is needed to optimise the separation and purification of these streams and expand their use in nutrient mixtures for the targeted soil conditions.
Sustainable agricultural management can greatly benefit from the contribution of new, bio-based pesticides and fertilisers.
The specific challenge of this topic is to overcome hurdles in the production of biopesticides and bio-based fertilisers to benefit sustainable agricultural management.
1 See also Horizon 2020 SC2 topic CE-RUR-08-2018-2019-2020 C[2020]: Bio-based fertilisers from other by-products of the agro-food, fisheries, aquaculture or forestry sectors (IA).
2 According to the UK Health and Safety Executive, “biopesticides are plant protection products which contain biological control agents (microbials, pheromones, plant extracts etc.) for use as agricultural, horticultural and home garden pesticides.“ The FAO describes biopesticides (biological pesticides) as ”a generic term, not specifically definable, but generally applied to a biological control agent, usually a pathogen, formulated and applied in a manner similar to a chemical pesticide, and normally used for the rapid reduction of a pest population for short-term pest control“. [International Standards for Phytosanitary Measures 1 to 24, 2005]
3 The term ’fertilisers’ should be understood in a broad sense. The Commission proposal for the revised Fertiliser Regulation COM(2016) 157provides access to the internal market to a broad range of fertilising products including mineral, organo-mineral and organic fertilisers, soil improvers, growing media and plant biostimulants. Certain substances, mixtures and micro-organisms, commonly referred to as plant biostimulants, are not as such nutrients, but nevertheless stimulate plants' nutrition processes by improving plant nutrition efficiency, plant resistance to abiotic stress, and crop quality. They could play a significant role to improve the sustainability of arable land.
Scope:
Demonstrate the production of effective and cost-efficient biopesticides or fertilisers from sustainable biomass sources. Proposals should address either biopesticides or fertilisers.
Proposals should tackle the efficient sourcing, biochemical characterisation and extraction of appropriate fractions or compounds; the separation and purification of the desired stream; and the optimal and safe production of the standardised final bioactive products.
Proposals should include an experimental validation stage, assessing the effect of the developed products on the targeted crop(s). Proposals should also compare the application of the developed bio-products and conventional (synthetic) products to relevant soil types and growing conditions.
Proposals should address the elimination of hurdles and bottlenecks, transport modes regarding the logistics and associated infrastructure in the targeted biomass feedstock supply systems. These include collection systems, intermediate storage and safety aspects (see also introduction – section 2.2.5 - published in the BBI JU AWP 2018).

Proposals should carefully assess the potential occupational health risks and environmental impacts associated with the production and use of the developed products. Any potential hazards associated with the developed processes and products should be analysed to ensure that the products comply fully with REACH1 legislation and other toxicity requirements, safety requirements and any relevant EU legislation.

Proposals should commit to assessing the environmental and economic impacts of the developed products or processes, using LCA methodologies based on available standards, certification, accepted and validated approaches (see also introduction – section 2.2.5 - published in the BBI JU AWP 2018)2. If applicable, proposals should also analyse the social impacts.
Proposals should be based on a sound business case and business plan.

If relevant, proposals should also allow for pre- and co-normative research necessary for developing the needed product quality standards.
The technology readiness level (TRL)3 at the end of the project should be 6. Proposals should clearly state the starting TRL.
Indicative funding:
It is considered that proposals requesting a maximum contribution EUR 7 million would be able to address this specific challenge appropriately. However, this does not preclude the submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.

Expected Impact:
contribute to KPI 1: create at least one new cross-sector interconnection in bio-based economy;
contribute to KPI 2: set the basis for at least one new bio-based value chain;

Residual streams from various bio-based operations contain, among others, low-molecular compounds that severely inhibit the growth of the currently known fermenting microorganisms. As a result, the yields and quality of the desired products are too low for a successful, large-scale application of fermentation pathways to valorise these residual streams. To solve these problems, microbes must be adapted to enable the desired conversion steps.
However, there are microorganisms that are resistant to inhibitors and can perform the desired conversion steps in inhibitor-containing streams. Using omics and other techniques to identify and isolate these microorganisms could lead to new systems producing value-added products through fermentation. Their performance may be further improved through metabolic engineering or any other advanced, new biotechnology in this field.
The specific challenge of this topic is to better exploit microorganisms that are resistant to inhibitors.
Scope:
Identify, isolate, where applicable engineer, and use inhibitor-resistant microorganisms, and set up the subsequent fermentation processes at lab scale to create added-value products.
This topic includes any operation that uses agriculture-based, forest-based, aquatic/marine-based or bio-waste feedstock to convert it into marketable products. This topic excludes any fossil-based operations and CO2-feedstock. It also excludes any proposal that targets biofuels as the major or sole marketable products.
The scope specifically covers early-stage development proposals, the aim being to lay the groundwork for new technologies converting biomass into added-value products. Several biotechnological approaches may be used that are new or currently not widely used in biorefining operations producing chemicals and materials, including ’omics’, metabolic engineering and synthetic biology.

Electrical energy prices fluctuate greatly, due to the widespread adoption of renewable sources. At peak production times – on sunny summer or windy winter days, for instance – energy can become virtually free. Electrochemical processes are becoming attractive, as they can be integrated into smart grid set-ups to exploit surplus energy and convert bio-based feedstock into chemicals and materials. This, in turn, may lead to considerably less expensive production than conventional routes can offer.
Moreover, smart electrochemical processes have the ability to setting the process conditions more precisely, providing a tool to ‘custom-make’ molecules with, for example, the desired molecular weights or specific functionalities. Depending on the biomass feedstock, the processes can produce various groups of intermediate bio-based platform molecules for direct use or further processing.
The specific challenge of this topic is to exploit surplus electric energy for the inexpensive electrochemical conversion of biomass feedstock and prepare this technology for upscaling.
Scope:
Develop electrochemical processes to convert bio-based feedstock into targeted monomers and/or polymers.
The scope of this topic includes any bio-based feedstock.
Processes should be able to easily start, stop and resume, so that they can be triggered to consume energy only when available at a negligible price, thereby allowing for inexpensive production. The developed processes should be suitable for upscaling.

","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Biocatalysts – enzymes and the microorganisms that contain them – offer great potential for the large-scale production of high-value products from renewable, bio-based feedstock. Unlike the conventional chemical conversion processes, biocatalytic conversions typically take place under mild conditions and achieve higher selectivity of specific characteristics, such as chirality. In addition, biocatalysis can realise the targeted conversion of specific biomass fractions such as lignin.
Currently available methods to screen and engineer microbial strains to display the desired biocatalytic features are often time-consuming and expensive, due to the inherent complexity of the metabolic networks involved. A significant improvement of these steps would allow for optimising the biocatalytic conversion of specific feedstocks in well-defined operating conditions, and would help consolidate the competitive advantage of biocatalysis over traditional chemical processes.
Moreover, the success of using biocatalysts for conversion processes is often dependent on the type of the targeted biomass feedstock and the presence of bioprocess inhibitors therein. Feedstock with a mixed composition, like lignocellulose and residual biomass that also contains inhibitors, presents the greatest challenges to biocatalytic transformation. Consequently, for the optimisation and monitoring of a bioprocess there is a need for a detectable/selectable microbial phenotype that correlates biocatalytic activity to the formation of the desired chemical end-product.
The specific challenge of this topic is to phenotypically link the performance of biocatalysts to specific product formation, considering feedstock type and quality, and operating conditions including the presence of inhibitors.
Scope:
Apply innovative techniques to select the biocatalysts to optimally tackle specific feedstock type and composition for high selectivity and yield of the targeted product. If needed, these techniques should be further developed to improve the performance of the biocatalysts in dealing with inhibitors and the operating conditions.
These techniques should include both:
selecting and screening systems linking a readily accessible phenotype to product formation; and
techniques for analysing, selecting and improving the performance of microorganisms or enzymes to achieve higher efficiency of a given bioprocess.
Proposals should focus on either microorganisms or cell-free enzyme-based systems.
Metabolic and enzymatic engineering strategies may be pursued, as may microbial engineering through gene editing concepts.
Proposals should efficiently prove the innovativeness of the approaches for the purpose of subsequently applying the developed techniques at larger scales.
Proposals should deliver methods to achieve biocatalysis conversions that are more efficient than state-of-the-art alternatives. Proposals should seek to expand on projects already funded under Horizon 2020 and earlier projects to avoid overlap, promote synergies and advance beyond state-of-the-art methods.
The industry should actively participate to demonstrate the potential for integrating the developed concepts into current industrial landscapes or existing plants so that the concepts can be deployed more quickly and scaled up to apply industrial-wide.
Proposals should specifically demonstrate the benefits of the new approaches versus the state-of-the-art and existing technologies. This could be done by providing evidence of new or more efficient processing solutions and new products obtained.
Proposals should commit to assessing the environmental impacts of the developed processes or products using LCA methodologies based on available standards, certification, accepted and validated approaches (see introduction – section 2.2.5 - published in the BBI JU AWP 2018)1.

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
The objective of wood pulping is to separate cellulose fibres from the other wood components (lignin, hemicelluloses, extractives, etc.). Those components end up as side streams, making up a considerable share of the pulp mill’s output. For example, in the case of the dominant chemical pulping process (the kraft process, which accounts for roughly 90 % of the world’s chemically produced pulp), around half of the initial wood substances degrades and dissolves into the cooking liquor or black liquor. Black liquor is concentrated and burnt to obtain energy. However, there are opportunities to obtain more value for the substances diverted to black liquor.
Moreover, the pulp and paper sector is focusing on reducing its environmental impact by consuming less energy, curbing its use of polluting chemical products and bringing down CO2 emissions from its operations. Key to achieving this target is the development of new pulping processes that can be effective at lower temperatures, use fewer chemical agents and make better overall use of the biomass feedstock.
Several disruptive technologies have surfaced in recent years. A study by the Confederation of the European Paper Industries (CEPI) in November 20131 singled out eight breakthrough concepts projected to change the face of pulp- and papermaking processes by 20502.
The specific challenge of this topic is to bring breakthrough concepts in lignocellulosic pulping from lab scale to pilot scale and paving the way for further upscaling and industry uptake.
1http://www.cepi.org/system/files/public/documents/publications/innovation/2013/finaltwoteamprojectreport_website_updated.pdf
2PROVIDES, a BBI RIA project from the 2014 Call, addresses one of these technologies, concluding at TRL 3-4 in 2018. Overlaps have to be avoided.
Scope:
Introduce breakthrough pulping technologies in a relevant environment at pilot scale, deriving maximum benefit from the feedstock with a significant increase in sustainability, cost- and resource-effectiveness.
This topic targets breakthrough innovation involving new technologies or equipment.
Proposals could also focus on better utilisation of the side streams through valorisation steps that outperform state-of-the-art alternatives in an integrated biorefinery approach.
The proposed solutions may introduce:
fundamental innovation in the pulping process itself, changing the way in which the components of wood are separated from each other; or
technological steps before or during an established pulping process to obtain separate streams of side-products; or
technological steps downstream of an established pulping process to recover the most promising components from the pulping effluents.
Proposals should focus on one of the three options above, but could address more of them. The chosen option should deliver separate streams that can be converted into compounds with a higher value than the current one, for further valorisation into market applications. These steps should therefore target required yields, quality and purity for further conversion steps.
To validate the concept, proposals should include at least a first conversion step to convert the promising components into usable compounds for further valorisation.
The new technological concepts should deliver a new product or create higher value through performance and sustainability criteria. Proposals should justify the selection of the technologies.
While a maximum conversion rate should be the aim, it is not mandatory to cover 100 % of the original wood components. Proposals opting to focus on a fraction of them should justify the exclusion of the others on grounds of cost, sustainability or technology readiness.
Proposals should include an assessment of the market potential of the promising components through the necessary subsequent processing steps.
The industry should actively participate to demonstrate the potential for integrating the developed concepts into current industrial landscapes or existing plants so that the concepts can be deployed more quickly and scaled up to apply industrial-wide.
Proposals should specifically demonstrate the benefits versus the state-of-the-art and existing technologies.

Develop innovative technologies for conversion of a bio-based feedstock into intermediate streams that can readily be used by the bio-based industry. Such conversion should happen in a single step, not involving complex cascading schemes, and should tackle all fractions of the input biomass.
The scope of this topic covers any bio-based feedstock.
Proposals are encouraged to focus on existing value chains. If proposals focus on new value chains, they must provide a sound business case (including at least evidence of availability of the biomass and market demand for the intermediates produced).
Proposals should commit to assessing the environmental impacts of the developed processes or products using LCA methodologies based on available standards, certification, accepted and validated approaches1. (see introduction – section 2.2.5 - published in the BBI JU AWP 2018)
Proposals should also include an economic viability performance check (value chain and market analysis) of the developed products and processes, along with an analysis of social impacts where applicable.
If relevant, proposals should also allow for pre- and co-normative research necessary for developing the needed product quality standards.
The technology readiness level (TRL)2 at the end of the project should be at least 3 for the bio-based value chain in question. Proposals should clearly state the starting TRL, which may be as low as 1 or 2.
The scope aims at assisting industry to further explore promising technologies to broaden and strengthen the bio-based industries in Europe. It also aims at reducing the environmental footprint of the total value chain.
Indicative funding:
It is considered that proposals requesting a BBI JU contribution of between EUR 1 million and EUR 2,5 million would allow the specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. However, this does not preclude the submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
To be eligible for participation a consortium must contain at least one constituent entity of the Bio-based Industry Consortium not eligible for JU funding according to Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) No 623/2014.
1The LCA may focus on a set of critical issues early on to steer the development process in the right direction. In this case, it is essential that this selection is carefully explained in the proposal in order to allow for expert assessment. See also in the introduction

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Aromatic building blocks make up a significant share of today’s building blocks for a wide array of day-to-day products and applications, including nylons, polystyrene, resins and polycarbonates.
Current production routes from fossil-based feedstock are energy-intensive and have a significant environmental footprint.
Moreover, the gradual introduction of shale gas and other light feedstocks in oil refining and cracking operations is resulting in significant production cuts to building blocks heavier than ethylene.
Until now, production costs have been the prime obstacle to bio-based aromatics penetrating the market. The maturity of the petrochemical industry makes purely cost-based competition unrealistic for most bio-based aromatics, especially benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and xylene. However, better performance at an acceptable premium price would increase the marketability of bio-based aromatics for mass consumption.
Composition complexity and other characteristics of various biomass feedstock hinder the exploitation of their enormous potential to produce aromatic compounds that could outperform petrochemical alternatives.
The specific challenge of this topic is to increase the process yields of aromatics from sustainable biomass sources able to outperform fossil-based counterparts.
Scope:
Develop innovative technologies and systems to produce bio-based aromatics with new functionalities, from sustainable sources at reasonable cost.
The new functionality could, for example, be displayed by bio-based aromatics that are isomers of petrochemical aromatics, and/or contain functional groups that are absent in petrochemical aromatics.
Proposals should prove that the properties of at least two products/applications are improved by using bio-based aromatics with a ‘new functionality’ compared to existing alternatives based on fossil-derived counterparts.
This topic includes all types of biomass excluding food and feed crops (but including agricultural residues), and allows biotechnological and chemical conversion technologies.
Proposals should deliver the required amounts of intermediate streams for efficient downstream steps to separate and purify the targeted bio-aromatics.
Proposals should specify potential application areas of the selected new bio-based aromatics.
The industry should actively participate to demonstrate the potential for integrating the developed concepts into current industrial landscapes or existing plants, so that the concepts can be deployed more quickly and scaled up to apply industry-wide.
Industry’s participation should also guarantee that the applications are assessed as having properties relevant for industry (using well-known methods and standards).
Proposals should specifically demonstrate the benefits versus the state-of-the-art and existing technologies. This could be done by providing evidence of new processing solutions and new products obtained.
Proposals should commit to assessing the environmental impacts of the developed processes or products using LCA methodologies based on available standards, certification, accepted and validated approaches (see also introduction – section 2.2.5 - published in the BBI JU AWP 2018)1. Any potential hazards associated with the developed processes and products should be analysed to ensure that the products comply fully with REACH2 legislation and other toxicity requirements, safety requirements and any relevant EU legislation.
Proposals should also include an economic viability performance check (value chain and market analysis) of the developed products and processes, along with an analysis of social impacts where applicable.
If relevant, proposals should also allow for pre- and co-normative research necessary for developing the needed product quality standards.
The technology readiness level (TRL)3 at the end of the project should be at least 3 for the bio-based value chain in question. Proposals should clearly state the starting TRL, which may be as low as 1 or 2.

The global market for coatings is changing and growing as the requirements for the properties and performances of end-products (durability for packaging, wear resistance in machinery, etc.) become more demanding.
These changes open up interesting market prospects for bio-based coatings or coatings including bio-based components. However, generally speaking these coatings are not yet able to compete with traditional synthetic products on technical properties or cost. Although many research activities have been focusing on improving the characteristics of bio-based coatings, increasing their market share to meet new demand and to replace synthetic coatings is only just beginning.
Work to develop bio-based products to match the new high-performance requirements for coating applications should be speeded up to fill the projected gaps in quality and quantity.

Boosted by the increasing world population and the subsequent growth in demand for functional products for food, feed, nutraceuticals, cosmetics, pharma, etc., industry and academia are looking at alternative sources for bio-active ingredients that can provide functionality.
In looking at alternative sources, R&I efforts have been focusing on secondary biomass sources such as agro-food residues and alternative primary biomass sources like algae, microorganisms and invertebrates. However, to-date none of them has been able to establish itself as a large-scale alternative to food crops due to cost, technology readiness and regulatory hurdles.
The seasonality and high variability in the composition of some potential alternative feedstocks (such as residual biomass from agricultural, food or forest sectors, or seasonal aquatic biomass) are preventing them from being a sustainable source of bio-active compounds.
The specific challenge of this topic is to help meet the increasing demand for high-performance functional ingredients for various applications through the use of sustainable alternative sources.
Scope:
Demonstrate the cost-effective, efficient and sustainable production of high-performance functional ingredients that meet market demand and safety standards for target sectors such as food, feed, nutraceuticals, cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, etc. (see Introduction).
This topic covers all bio-active ingredients except proteins1.
Proposals should use biomass sources that can provide cost-effective, efficient and sustainable solutions to deliver functional ingredients in sustainable circular economy production systems.

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Fermentation processes have showed their efficiency for the production of a wide range of industrial products such as alcohols, acids, proteins, amino acids, and specialty carbohydrates. Although enabling milder processing conditions and the production of innovative molecules, their industrial uptake is hindered by the fact that actual yields at industrial scale are normally much lower than theoretical ones. Beyond strain capacities, industrial fermentation yields are strongly limited by factors like strain inhibitors (from upstream or from the fermentation), process set-up (including downstream processing of the produced molecules) and scale of the operations. Overcoming limitation of industrial process' yields is essential to improve the competitiveness of the processes and the target products, in particular for high added value products resulting from complex metabolic pathways.
Scope:
Demonstration of the techno-economic viability of fermentation processes by showing a significant increase of yields for a specific molecule or categories of molecules. Proposals should address the specific limiting factors of the considered targeted value chain: renewable feedstock, microorganism, and product. Proposals will address the integration of the fermentation process with the subsequent downstream step and will consider process intensification strategies such as in-situ product recovery, strain recycling or continuous fermentation. Proposals could consider the demonstration of downstream processing (purification technologies) if required in view of the substance produced. A Life Cycle Analysis should be carried out in order to evaluate the environmental and socio-economic performance of the developed process. Proposal will assess products demand and will consider market pull related activities (e.g. standardisation, consumers’ perception) aimed at facilitating the market uptake of the developed products. The leading role of relevant industrial partners is considered essential to achieve the full impact.

The establishment of competitive integrated biorefineries that process biomass in a cascading approach, and that are able to continuously operate year-round is one of the key goals of the whole BBI Initiative. This requires not only the establishment of new business and cooperation models (e.g. for primary and secondary economic sector cooperation) but, very importantly, research and development investments in (1) improving technologies pioneered by existing biorefineries in order to become cost-competitive with respect to fossil counterparts (2) developing a new generation of breakthrough technologies to form the basis for tomorrow’s biorefineries, (3) the enabling the combination and processing of different kinds of input biomass leading to the establishment of larger biorefineries, benefiting from scale economy. At present, most existing biorefineries are designed to process only one kind of feedstock (or at most a family of similar feedstock) with constant properties throughout the year. As a result, significant value chains are not exploited or under-exploited because of seasonal variation or unavailability of adequate quantities of sufficiently uniform feedstock at any given time of the year.
Scope:
Proposals should develop innovative biorefinery technologies enabling the establishment of new efficient year-round operation biorefinery concepts and bio-based value chains through the conversion of different types of biomass feedstocks, including underutilised seasonal feedstocks. Proposals should aim to significantly increase the efficiency, yield and cost-effectiveness of technologies enabling the production of cost-competitive bio-based products in a cascading approach. Technologies might include:
Fractionation and separation technologies to simplify the disintegration of biomass into its basic components;
Advanced technologies to mildly extract or separate components while preserving their functionalities and minimising the degradation of other components to enable their further valorisation;
Bio-chemical or chemo-catalytic technologies to convert bio-based components into high added value products;
Proposals should fit in a cascading concept aimed at the integral use of the feedstock. Proposals should take into account feedstock availability and flexibility throughout the year, with the goal of producing bio-products (chemicals, materials) that can be cost-competitive with fossil counterparts and/or feature new or improved properties. A life cycle oriented approach should be carried out in order to evaluate the environmental and socio-economic performances of the new concepts in comparison with their current alternatives. Strong weight will be put on industrial leadership to fully exploit the developed products/processes.
It is considered that proposals with a total eligible budget in the range of EUR 2-5 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals with another budget.

(i) Di-carboxylic acids from lignocellulosic sugars and their further conversion to end-products.
(ii) High added value products from lignocellulosic raw materials like high value fermentation products, (fine) chemicals, polymers, food additives or pharmaceuticals.
Proposals should identify the most effective feedstock/process combinations and will address, where relevant, the presence of inhibitor compounds affecting the conversion processes. Products and processes should be benchmarked against fossil based alternatives and/or conventional biomass-based products in terms of cost-competitiveness, quality and sustainability. Proposals should include activities to assure economical and sustained access to sufficient sustainable raw material to set up the new value chain. In order to meet the market requirements, the verification and validation of safety, quality and purity of end products should also be considered. Proposals will assess product demand and will consider market pull related activities (e.g. standardisation, consumers’ perception) aimed at facilitating the market uptake of the developed products. A life-cycle assessment on the environmental and socio-economic performances of the developed processes and products should be carried out. The leading role of relevant industrial partners is considered essential to achieve the full impact.
It is considered that proposals with a total eligible budget of up to EUR 15 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals with another budget.
Expected Impact:
Reducing the environmental impact and CO2 footprint with respect to traditional processes (either fossil based and/or produced from conventional feedstock).
Products that have a 2 - 3 times higher value than current products from these raw materials.

Existing lignocellulose-based biorefineries generate large-quantity side streams (e.g. hemicellulose, lignin, sugar derived condensed polymers) with limited accessibility for further conversion into valuable bio-based products, with the result that parts of these streams are currently burnt for energy production. Lignin is the most abundant of them as its complex structure makes it difficult to process it. Moreover, variations in feedstock and lignocellulose processing technologies significantly influence lignin properties thus requiring flexible approaches to be applied to the various heterogeneous lignin streams. The challenge is to enable the conversion of lignin-rich residual biorefinery streams into higher added value applications with a view to improving the sustainability and cost efficiency of the whole lignocellulose-based biorefinery concept.
Scope:
Develop efficient processes for the conversion of lignin-rich side streams from lignocellulosic biorefineries into biochemicals that have a higher value than their current energy application. Processes should be adaptable to different European‑relevant feedstocks. A cascading process could be envisaged in which lignin is progressively purified, depolymerised and refined to obtain different products from basic purified lignin. These products are to be used as e.g. substitute to phenol or other chemical building blocks, as a precursor for carbon fibres, functionalized lignin polymers or oligomers and monomers that could be further converted into chemicals, and solvents.

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Pre-treatment of lignocellulosic biomass is a crucial, although often overlooked step in processing: an optimised pre-treatment can increase productivity and reduce costs of subsequent processing stages. The quality of lignocellulosic feedstock is variable, both in terms of composition (i.e. sugar/lignin content) and in terms of presence of contaminants derived from e.g. the cultivation phase, harvest, previous applications of the feedstock, etc. Currently, the removal of contaminants and the separation between lignin and cellulose fractions are performed separately, with high cost for energy intensive pre-treatments and the generation of significant amounts of waste. Simultaneous pre-treatment and removal of contaminants today only exist on small scale by cocktails of fungi and enzymes on specific feedstock.
Release of degradation products is also common in the pre-treatment phase, during the breakdown of lignin. Presence of contaminants in the input biomass has repercussions on the final product (especially when dealing with food/feed ingredients, packaging or other consumer products). Many of such contaminants and degradation products are also known inhibitors of fermentative processes, with negative effects on the process yield and overall profitability. The challenge is to tackle these issues while significantly improving efficiency and reducing cost and energy usage. Resolving this challenge will remove a significant hurdle in enlarging the portfolio of biomass suitable for processing into feedstock.
Scope:
Develop a pre-treatment process that simultaneously performs the removal of contaminants and inhibitors arising from the separation of lignin and sugar fractions yielding a contaminant-free feedstock for subsequent processes. Proposals should aim for cost-efficient solutions that are able to simultaneously break down lignin and degrade contaminants. Proposals should assess the impact of the developed processes on the environmental, social and economic performance of the whole value chain, including consumer products and demonstrating safety benefits. Efficient ways to secure and manage safety issues using hazard assessment at critical control points, feeding into the regulatory framework, need to be addressed. Other elements can include savings in terms of time, additional compounds used and energy. A key aspect to be addressed is the balance between degradation of the pollutants and inhibitory products, and maximizing the yield of fermentable sugars from biomass, without compromising the downstream process of fermentation. A life-cycle assessment should be carried out in order to evaluate the environmental and socio-economic performance of the developed technologies. A credible path to move forward from the research phase towards the commercialisation of the results should be presented. Strong weight will be put on industrial leadership to fully exploit of the developed pre-treatment processes.

Specific challenge: Although market prospects of cellulose based products in textiles, films and thermoplastics are high, their current market share is relatively small due to environmental and cost limitations of current cellulose based processes such as viscose, lyocell and cellulose ester based ones. The need to meet tighter environmental demands and to compete with cotton and fossil based polymers counterparts calls for the development of high-cellulose content pulp, new innovative cellulose dissolution, regeneration and derivatisation processes.
Scope: Development of innovative cellulose dissolution processes and concomitant technologies enabling the production of cellulose based products with innovative properties. Proposals should address the processing and processability of pulp, including dissolving pulp, into new products such as textile fibres, films, and thermoplastic materials. If justified by improved processability or product quality, the proposals could also emphasise modification or improvements to dissolving pulp production. A life-cycle assessment should be carried out in order to evaluate the environmental and socio-economic performance of the developed technologies. The feasibility of integrating the developed technologies into existing industrial processing chains should be assessed. Proposals will consider potential standardisation-related activities expected to facilitate the market uptake of the developed products.
It is considered that proposals with a total eligible budget of between EUR 5 and 8 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals with another budget.
Expected impact:
         Delivering eco-friendly and cost-competitive cellulose products leading to a significant improvement in environmental performance, cost and quality as compared to establised alternatives.
         Strengthening market position of cellulose based products by a reduction of at least 10% of investment and operating costs of newly developed cellulose dissolving processes as compared to conventional ones.

Cellulose-based packaging composite materials, consisting of new compositions of cellulose fibres and biopolymers, could be a viable fully bio-based alternative for fossil-based mouldable plastics (e.g. PET, PP, PE and EPS) meeting the high demands of the packaging market. Cellulose-based packaging products have already been successfully produced for many years; however, in order to enlarge their market potential to specific higher demanding applications, such as in food and electronics packaging, new solutions are needed to improve their mechanical properties and address contaminant control (dust, bacteria and other impurities). An additional challenge is to combine these requirements with meeting the specific features required for aesthetic packaging (e.g. surface finishing, printability and durability).
Scope:
Demonstration of the techno-economic viability of a cellulose-based composite packaging enabling a reduction in weight and providing tailored shaped-to-purpose packages for various goods. Mechanical and functional properties (e.g. wet resistance) must be assessed against competing fossil-based products and relevant regulations, in particular when considering packaging for food products.

Specific challenge: The transformation of chemical pulp and paper mills into advanced biorefineries involves maximisation of the value derived from their cellulose main streams as well as their lignin-containing side streams by converting them into new and higher added value products. This in turn improves resource- and cost-effectiveness of their operations. Two important strategies in this endeavour are (i) the conversion of cellulose streams into innovative light weight structures for packaging and other applications (e.g. new concepts include foam-formed cellulose fibre based structures); (ii) the isolation of lignin from cooking spent liquors and its further conversion into value-added products.
Scope: Demonstration of the techno-economic viability of the production of at least two product ranges: one based on isolation and application of lignin and one based on the production and application of lightweight foam-formed cellulose. Proposals should demonstrate the feasibility of the different process stages of the manufacturing process. They should also specifically address the technological challenges related to: (i) for cellulose-products in particular wet pressing and drying of foam formed web and (ii) for lignin products in particular the separation of a constant quality lignin stream from black liquor, solving the problem of Na2SO4-emission.

The manufacture of various forest-derived products in different biorefinery processes depends heavily on the availability of efficient fractionation, separation and purification processes. Important research and development efforts have been dedicated to the efficient separation of the major structural organic polymers of the wood matrix: cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin. However, in view of maximising the value derived from forest biomass, mobilisation and valorisation of lower value feedstock such as bark and branches is required. Such feedstock is potentially a rich source of extractives such as oils, waxes, terpenes, tannins, steroidal compounds etc., which are currently underexploited due to the lack of efficient extraction and separation methods. The challenge is to expand the commercial exploitation of extractives beyond the low volume/high value applications currently available (e.g. as fragrance or flavour enhancers), such that market size matches their available volumes.
Scope:
Development of innovative and efficient processes for the separation and conversion of extractives from wood and wood residues, exploiting the large variety of chemical compositions available for obtaining specialty chemicals and/or larger volume products. Different approaches (such as microwave extractions, supercritical fluids, enzymatic and/or fermentative processes) can be applied, with a focus on providing energy- and cost-efficient solutions.

Specific challenge: The agro-industry has significant opportunities for developing high added value products by valorising currently underexploited resources in new applications and markets.  Two main feedstocks have been identified in this context: 1) growing dedicated non food feedstock in regions that are unsuitable for the production of food crops (e.g. oil crops in dry or marginal land); and 2) residues and side-streams from the agro-food value chain that are currently un- or under-utilised (e.g. vegetable pulp, bran, leaves). While demonstration activities are already being pursued to this end, the challenge lies in demonstrating at industrial scale a first of a kind, cost-effective new bio-based value chain for the conversion of the targeted streams into biochemical intermediates and subsequent production of added value products, e.g. biolubricants, bioplastics or biofillers.
Scope:Demonstration of the techno-economic viability of the sustainable conversion, by an integration of chemical and biotechnologies, of currently underutilised agricultural streams (which can be either oil crops  grown in dry environments, crops from marginal lands, or residues from the agro-food value chain) from a local integrated supply chain into bio‑chemical intermediates, and their subsequent processing into end-products (e.g. biolubricants, bioplastics and biofillers) at industrial scale (e.g. more than 30 ktons per year).

State-of-the-art manure-based processes, which are applied at small scale and mainly for the production of biogas alone, do not represent an economically viable alternative. The valorisation of manure requires the development and demonstration of large scale (centralised) concepts and the integration of advanced separation and conversion technologies in a cascading approach to transform manure into a range of higher added value products.
Scope: Demonstration of the techno-economic feasibility of a manure valorisation process, by centralised cascading processing into added-value biochemicals, including biogas. Proposals should aim for a demonstration unit in which technologies proven at lab-scale will be efficiently combined and scaled-up. Conversion of processing residues should deliver mineral-enriched products for soil fertilisation as well as other higher added value chemicals. Involvement of actors owning or having direct access to manure, as well as end-users of the fertilisers and chemicals is to be considered to ensure the viability of the developed concepts in the value chain. Proposals will consider standardisation related activities expected to facilitate the market uptake of the developed bioproducts.
 It is considered that proposals with a total eligible budget of at least EUR 8 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals with another budget.
Expected impact:
         Increasing cost–efficiency of manure processing towards a positive business case.
         Reducing GHG emissions of manure by 30% as compared to conventional processes.
         Turning negative value of manure into positive one, thus creating extra revenues for livestock industry currently coping with the manure as a costly problem.
Enabling the decision making process to move into industrial scale by the successful demonstration of the whole value-chain from manure to application."

The biodegradable fraction of MSW, mainly consisting of food residues and other organic materials, could be an economical and sustainable feedstock for biorefining purposes, while at present posing environmental challenges. The potential for exploiting this resource for conversion into chemical building blocks requires the demonstration of new technologies to arrive at novel viable solutions in terms of product's cost and quality. Organic acids are considered a promising product segment, which requires further investments with view to achieve their cost-effective production. In particular the following challenges need to be addressed: (1) maximising the use of biodegradable resources by applying an efficient cascaded conversion (2) improving biotechnology-based processes yield and concentration of organic acids in reaction mixtures (3) an additional challenge for unsorted MSW, lies in the efficient separation of the biodegradable fraction of unsorted MSW.
Scope:
Demonstration of the techno-economic viability of the conversion of the biodegradable fraction of MSW into organic acids in a cascading concept, leading to high conversion rates and high recovery of the biodegradable part along the whole waste value chain. Proposals dealing with unsorted MSW could include the demonstration of an efficient sorting and separation technology for the biodegradable fraction of MSW achieving also a sufficient cleanliness of the non-biodegradable by-products enabling further processing and recycling. Proposals will assess product demand and will consider market pull related activities (e.g. standardisation, consumers’ perception) aimed at facilitating the market uptake of the developed products. A Life Cycle Analysis should be carried out in order to evaluate the environmental and socio-economic performance of the developed process. Proposals should assure economical and sustainable access to sufficient raw material to set up the new value chain. The leading role of relevant industrial partners is considered essential to achieve the full impact.

Activities in the Mediterranean Sea related to border surveillance, including fight against drug trafficking and illegal immigration as well as search-and-rescue operations require for the authorities to detect at a long distance (typically: over the horizon) the presence of small vessels. The performance of existing radar systems need to be improved to that effect, or to be combined with other technologies. The cost and power requirements of such systems need to be lowered. Their deployment must also take into account the coastal environment, and they must integrate properly in the landscape. They should interface seamlessly with existing infrastructure supporting operations undertaken, or the services provided by the CISE constituent communities.

Pre-competitive research in areas ranging from sensor design, to the analysis and design of system configuration and integration and validation by (public) authorities for target detection, identification and recognition. Projects will focus only on border surveillance and search and rescue (not defence) needs.
Expected impact:
To contribute to redress the limitations of current border surveillance systems at sea, particularly concerning the detection and tracking of small unseaworthy vessels. Impact will be benchmarked against improved capabilities to meet surveillance requirements in conditions ranging from those of the Southern Atlantic to the Greek archipelago. This topic would contribute further to the development of the European Border Surveillance System (EUROSUR) and the Common Information Sharing Environment (CISE) at sea.

Specific challenge: The production of nutrients and fertilisers currently relies heavily on mineral resources whose reserves are limited and depleting. Recovery of nutrients from biowaste streams (e.g. food waste, biodegradable fraction of Municipal Solid Waste, manure) represents a promising sustainable resource which could play a part when finding solutions to the foreseen global nutrient shortage. While there are a few experiences in Europe of nutrient recovery from waste water and from ashes, none of them has found application at large commercial scale. The potential to further source nutrients from waste streams requires the application of cost effective nutrient recovery processes, free of hazardous elements (heavy metals, pathogens) which provide readily available nutrients for crops, while competing in quality and price with the current fertilisers.
Scope: Development of dedicated recovery processes for nutrients from biowaste streams and bioresidues rich in plant nutrients (especially phosphorous and potassium compounds) through extraction, solubilisation, precipitation, chemical reaction and other emerging chemical  or biological processes. Upgrading of recovered nutrients to new sustainable fertilisers by a cost-effective combination of specific organic and mineral components. Proposals should address the industrial integration of the process into the cascaded valorisation of the waste streams (including the isolation of other added value products) and show the economic viability of the developed products via in-vivo trials.  A life-cycle assessment should be carried out in order to evaluate the environmental and socio-economic performance of the developed products in the whole value chain. Involvement of feedstock suppliers and end-users of the fertilisers could be considered towards assuring the viability of the developed concepts in the value chain.

Specific challenge:
Border authorities are facing new challenges to secure land borders of the EU/Schengen areas, while the recent trends show a significant increase of travellers’ flows. In the meantime, travellers are requiring fast and convenient border crossing, therefore pushing authorities to implement novel approaches in order to maintain and even improve the throughput at the crossing points.
Infrastructure for land border checks is not very flexible. As a consequence, improved solutions are required. They could rely on the development of mobility concepts along with traveller programmes that are extensively being developed in order to facilitate border crossing. Moreover, the current wide-spread use of mobile devices such as smartphones or tablets provide potentially exploitable means that could (or could not) be combined with border authorities dedicated mobile equipment to perform identity checking for border security.
A general challenge is to make the technical equipment affordable enough to be widely employed.
Scope:
Studies show that, in the long term perspective, the task of border management to facilitate legitimate border crossings, while detecting and preventing illicit activities, will remain a critical capability, given the expected rising cross-border flows of people (and goods). Border control is likely to face increasing demands for efficiency, which implies a need for technical systems that are user friendly and reliable in operational conditions. The approach to use technology from adjacent markets such as mobile or satellite telecommunications, where the volumes of production are very high, could help the costs of processing down to a minimum. In particular, the use of passengers' personal mobile devices is expected to enable efficient and reliable identity checks through the application of biometric technology.
The ability to automatically and rapidly detect document forgeries is also expected to be further improved. Projects should therefore aim at proposing novel concepts relying on the use of traveller’s personal mobile devices, and/or border authorities’ specific mobile equipment, for high security level passengers’ identity control. What is needed is to perform biometric identification of travellers inside vehicles (cars, bus, trains) as well as pedestrians. R&D could propose novel technological solutions, as well as procedures to manage relevant associated workflows (to be validated by border guards in a realistic operational scenario). An appropriate portable (and, if considered necessary, fixed) ABC gate for land borders could be developed (if portable, this gate should be movable so that it could be used at lanes outside the terminal). In this research legal, ethical or social implications must be taken into account appropriately.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between €2m and €5m would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected impact:
Research should lead to novel mobility concepts for land border security enabling authorities to achieve higher throughput at the crossing points whilst guaranteeing high security level, enabling fast processing of passengers within vehicles or pedestrians, and improving the efficiency of passengers flow management. Harmonization of requirements across Member States and Associated Countries (and standardization) is expected to also automatically greatly improve affordability. The outcome of the research should be assessed in terms of contribution to meeting such challenges.

Specific challenge:
The ever-growing number of travellers crossing the EU borders poses a serious challenge to the border control authorities in terms of a reduced amount of time for carrying out border checks. Consequently, efforts are being undertaken to facilitate the travel of bona-fide and genuine passengers and simultaneously to safeguard high level of security. In particular, in the field of person and document authentication and/or verification, the  deployment of biometric-based approaches led to significant advances as regards making the border control processes more efficient. Further explorations, going beyond state-of-the-art, of biometric-based person identification detection techniques are expected to contribute to making the daily work of border control authorities more efficient and to significantly facilitating bona-fide non-EU citizens in crossing EU external borders.
Scope:
Research is needed in order to explore whether it is possible to use other biometric data (potentially already used in another context and in another domain) than fingerprint, iris or facial picture to store in the e-Passport chip, which would guarantee the same or higher level of security, but would be more accurate and could be retrieved in a more efficient manner than in the case of the conventionally used biometric data types. In addition, practical experiences lead to the assumption that for non-critical travelers (EU, bona-fide etc.) a most fluent non-intrusive control process is desired. Therefore, to increase accuracy, in this case the use of contactless techniques (e.g. face, 3D face, iris) and multi-biometric fusion is likely to be preferred over contact-based technologies.
While the introduction of new biometric-based modalities in the process of person identification might lead to making this process more accurate and efficient, an integral part of the research should also embrace the related ethical, societal and data protection aspects. Work should include optimization of the use of current biometric modalities and consideration of how services offered by countries outside of the EU may result in a more efficient and user-friendly experience for the traveler. The development of modeling techniques, artificial intelligence and the creation of datasets for use by academics and commercial entities should be a priority. The work carried out should also include research on the theme of multi-modal biometrics in border control.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between €3m and €5m would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected impact:
Non-EU residents contributed €271 billion to the economy of Member States and Associated Countries when travelling to the EU in 2011. Business travellers, workers, researchers and students, third country nationals with family ties to EU citizens or living in regions bordering the EU are all likely to cross the borders several times a year. Making it as easy as possible for them to come to the EU would ensure that Europe remains an attractive destination and helps boosting economic activity and job creation. The outcome of the research should be assessed  in terms of potential to improve border management and control modalities facilitating travel without compromising security. The expected impact is to make the daily work of border control authorities more efficient and to significantly facilitate bona-fide non-EU citizens in crossing EU external borders.

Apart from the known problem of a continuous increase of travellers crossing EU external borders border control authorities are confronted with a wide range of other problems, including: (a) less staff and financial means in the nearby future, (b) emergence of new technologies supposed to support border authorities in carrying out border control and surveillance tasks, and (c) a growing amount of information available to them coming from various sources (e.g., national or international information systems, sensors, open sources, etc.). Having “less people”, but “new tools and machines” and “more information available” requires establishment of mechanisms to improve decision making processes in the context of planning resources allocation and information workflows. A general challenge is to make the equipment and procedures more appropriate for wide employment. A further general challenge that applies to all scenarios is interoperability (operational as well as technical).
Scope:
Studies show that, in the long term perspective, the task of border management to facilitate legitimate border crossings, while detecting and preventing illicit activities, will remain a critical capability, given the expected rising cross border flow of people and goods. Border controls thus face increasing demand for efficiency, which implies the need for technical systems and procedures that are user friendly and reliable in operational conditions.
Research is needed in order to conceptualize and develop tools that would facilitate: (a) planning cost- and performance-efficient allocation of assets and human resources to border control tasks, (b) exploration of how to best combine operators with new technologies (e.g., through simulations, virtual environments), and (c) designing optimal information workflows for particular border control scenarios to avoid disproportionate burden on EU external border control authorities and economic operators/citizens, (i.e., which information to utilize and fuse with other, and which to discard, with a view to address the threats in the most efficient manner and at the best place (e.g. in the logistical chain of goods flows)) etc. The underlying data to support the decision making and/or planning in the context of such tool could come from past information gathered over longer period of time.

The outcome of the research should be assessed in terms of improved border control modalities with a view to dedicate more time and resources to identify those who may pose a threat. The expected impact is to make the daily work of border control authorities more efficient and to significantly facilitating non-EU citizens and goods/economic operators in crossing EU external borders.

Specific challenge:
The combination of surface and airborne mobile assets is used to detect, identify and track targets (typically: small boats) travelling beyond coastal waters. A variety of obstacles have to be faced in current operations, and improved performances and reaction capabilities are required. Tactical communications between surface and aerial assets are considered key for improving situational awareness, early warning and reaction capacity. A particular weakness lies in communications capabilities among the mobile assets and the control centres (in particular in relation to tactical communications, interoperability and standardization). Better surveillance platforms are necessary, with improved communication performance, improved endurance (it should be more than 10 hours), and reduced operational cost (10 to 20 per cent of that of a Maritime Patrol Aircraft).
Scope:
The proposed action must be structured along the following phases:
Phase 0: The participating users/buyers of R&D service should agree on common performance levels and associated specifications for the detection, early identification, and tracking of moving targets, as well as on communication specifications, standards and interfaces for information exchanges between platforms (be them surface or airborne). Interoperability to existing systems should be analysed.
Phase 1: They will plan the research and the design of solutions covering a broad variety of issues, including technologies for:
surveillance (e.g. lower weight/higher performance radar and electro-optic/systems and hyper-spectral sensors);
detection and early identification and tracking of moving targets (e.g. with moving target indication and data fusion/correlation capabilities), including the detection of marine pollution incidents;
response (e.g. techniques for the analysis of identification of anomalous behaviour and generation of alarm with the appropriate confidence level, methods for improved mission planning, obstacle detection and avoidance);
higher efficiency/lower emissions/low operational costs naval architecture and platforms (crafts, small boats);
air-to-surface tactical communication and cooperation between naval and aerial platforms.
Aerial platforms should carry at least a Maritime Surveillance payload consisting of: Light maritime radar, Electro-Optical camera (Visible and IR), AIS receiver, SATCOM for beyond line of sight operation. The platform should be fitted with mission support software providing data fusion capability and close to real time transmission to ground control station of mission data.
The results of phase 1 should lead to calls for tenders (for the procurement of R&D services) which focus on technologies clearly identified to be part of a unique architecture.
Phase 2: The research and specification work should lead to at least 3 prototypes, each consisting of a system including communicating airborne and seaborne equipped platform(s). Prototyping should contribute to standardisation, including of naval construction. The aerial platform(s) should be certified for flying with a pilot on board, with mission payload being controlled from a ground station, and the platform should be tested to fly in remote piloted mode. The work during this phase should be procured in the light of the development of European regulations as regards to RPAS for improved surveillance, possibly flying in non-segregated air spaces.
Phase 3: By 2020, the project should have designed, documented, and set up at least one operational scenario in which all the prototypes and elements of systems issued from the previous phase of the action (possibly combined with pre-existing capabilities) will be tested. This scenario should take place within an actual multinational operation, such as a FRONTEX-coordinated joint operation. The participation of competent border authorities should therefore be a prerequisite for the implementation of this action.
Expected impact:
Impact will depend on the potential to develop and validate future solutions by means of the experimentation with innovative proposals in a real operational environment. This can be achieved if procurement actions are tailored to the requirements defined by the users/buyers of the R&D services, and also take due account of industrial capacities to ensure future supply.
The work undertaken under this topic is expected to improve the cost-effectiveness and efficiency of the prototype systems as compared to more conventional border surveillance systems, and the systems used for the detection of marine pollution incidents. It would contribute further to the development of the Common Information Sharing Environment (CISE) at sea initiative. By enhancing joint communications capabilities, as well as the mobility, projection and sustainability of a common pan-European pool of maritime border patrol equipment, it will also contribute to the concept of Common Application of Surveillance Tools, as included in the final steps of the European Border Surveillance System1 (EUROSUR).
For the impact of the action to be above threshold the proposal must necessarily state:
the participants' agreement to negotiate in good faith and on a case by case basis, licenses to any and all of their to the background necessary for the implementation and use of the contents of the standards, specifications, design, research roadmaps, tender packages or other documents generated in the action.
the participants' commitment that all such licenses shall be according to Fair, Reasonable and Non-Discriminatory (“FRAND”) terms.”
Type of action: Pre-Commercial Procurement (PCP) co-fund action
Further to the PCP’s successful achievement, the European Commission may consider launching a PPI to facilitate the acquisition of operational systems satisfying the specifications established within the PCP, possibly in synergy with the Internal Security Fund.
Indicative budget: The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between €5m and €12m would allow for this challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Timeframe: The action is expected to have performed the testing of prototypes in the context of operational scenarios by 2020.
 [1] The aim of EUROSUR is to reinforce the control of the Schengen external borders. EUROSUR will establish a mechanism for Member States'authorities carrying out border surveillance activities to share operational information with a view to reduce the loss of lives at sea and the number of irregular immigrants entering the EU undetected, and  increase internal security by preventing cross-border crime such trafficking in human beings and the smuggling of weapons and drugs.

Specific challenge:
The deployment of maritime surveillance system for border control has exerted pressure on smugglers in the last years. Drug smugglers reacted by changing their modus operandi using low flying aircrafts to cross borders undetected. It is a global issue, addressed in particular by the Mini Dublin Group of the UN. As an example, this situation has been identified as a major gap to combat drug smuggling entering through the south coast of Spain and Portugal.
In this case the typical scenario (in line with the concepts of operations being defined by the Frontex agency) is a small low flying aircraft loaded with drugs. This kind of aircrafts land in small airports, runways, or even roads and landstrips, which makes the early detection of these aircrafts crucial to determine the landing area.
Scope:
Required technologies and systems to be investigated and developed may include:
Identification of technological gaps in already operational systems, including those used by the military, and in cooperation with responsible authorities.
Mobile units which can be quickly deployable in remote areas with communication links with command and control centres.
Multi-mode radar technologies for the early detection, target pre-classification and tracking of low flying aircrafts.
Integration of radar data and correlation with repositories of information to predict most probable landing areas.
New type of sensors that could be deployed at low cost increasing the detection and narrowing the grid of detection. The solutions proposed should consider the employment of technologies enabling multi-functionality and miniaturization of the hardware components.
Geo-spatial database of existing and potential runways as well as its operational status, using Earth Observation technology and GIS (geographic information systems) analysis.
The scope and outcomes of this line of research may be applied also to land border security.
Solutions should be validated in a realistic operational context.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between €3m and €5m would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
In line with the EU's strategy for international cooperation in research and innovation[1] international cooperation is encouraged, and in particular with international research partners involved in ongoing discussions and workshops, and US homeland security research entities. Funding for third countries is however still subject to the  evaluations.
Expected impact:
This topic is expected to contribute further to the development of the European Border Surveillance System[2] (EUROSUR).
The impact of the research shall be measured in terms of increased capabilities to contribute to the prevention of cross border crime, in particular in terms of reduction of the traffic of drugs, weapons and illicit substances. Its outcome should complement the surveillance tools (and strategy) being used at present. The adaptability of the developed technology to other missions (not just border security) would be an additional factor of merit.

Deadline date","Scope:
Specific challenge:
Smugglers try to evade controls at borders by using their bodies as the conduit to conceal prohibited or restricted goods. These items may be narcotics, explosives, currency and weapons and could also be ampoules containing chemical and biological threats. All these items could remain undetected by conventional technologies.
There is a need to develop body-scan technology able to discern those commodities sought by Customs from benign materials carried by travellers. The device/system should have the capability to automatically identify the chemical composition of the main threat commodities. Such systems are expected to improve efficiency of inspection of suspected individuals, improve security at the border and act as a deterrent to other potential smugglers.
Scope:
There are two different scenarios that technology is required for. Although ideally a system would have a capability to be deployed to cover both operational situations, it is accepted that at this stage it may not be possible, due to the types of core technology used, so within this topic the requirements are shown separately to clarify the challenge, and so assist development in proposals which may be for either a sub category or for a combined solution.
1) Internally concealed commodities
Packages may be ingested, or inserted into body orifices. Ingested packages may be formed of compressed powder, or even liquid and may weight from a few hundred grams up to over a kilo. Non-ingested items may be several hundred grams. Drugs, used in the example, are by nature organic, so it is difficult to distinguish them visually from other organic or food waste in the digestive system of the human body. Transmission x-ray is a useful tool, but it is an imaging technology which requires interpretation. There is a potential for error and packages may be missed.
There is a requirement to develop a body-scanner capable of identifying and alerting an operator to specific threats (such as narcotics /explosives etc.) concealed inside the body. If the technology in the proposal were to utilise ionising radiation, it would have to comply with European limits of dose and comply with any justification process for the use of radiation, , which might be in force with the countries of intended operation. It should also be noted that not all Member States and Associated Countries permit use of ionising radiation for non-medical purposes
2) Externally concealed commodities.
Packages such as drugs can be concealed beneath clothing and even be moulded to map the body contours, which can be compensated for by the wearing or larger clothing. A human can conceal up to 5 kilos in this manner, which can be remain undetected. Organic materials which have been on the body for a significant duration can become opaque to some technologies, that operate in the thermal-sensitive domain, if they are close to the body temperature. The ideal novel solutions must be able to distinguish those materials of Customs or Police/Security interest from harmless items and alert the operator. This solution would typically be applied to a “non-divest” situation. It must be able to work in real-time, not to disrupt passenger flow or movement of a crowd. Preferably the solution should be able to deal with more than one person within the field of view, or at least other people in the frame should not interfere with the performance of the primary target. Performance will have to be validated in a realistic scenario. Proposals dealing with the concurrent screening of bags and other carried possessions would be of interest.
The technology should pose no risk to particular groups, or those with health issues (children, pregnant woman, pacemakers). The privacy of individuals must be respected.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between €2m and €5m would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
In line with the EU's strategy for international cooperation in research and innovation[1] international cooperation is encouraged, and in particular with international research partners involved in ongoing discussions and workshops, and US homeland security research entities. Funding for third countries is however still subject to the  evaluations.
Expected impact:
The technology to be developed under (1) and (2) would primarily be operated by Customs/Border control staff but may well have wider application for other security and law enforcement authorities. It is expected:
- to exceed the capability of current technologies being used by Customs administrations in some Member States and Assosciated Countries;
- to significantly improve security at the border;
- to constitute an effective tool against organised crime;
- to lead to increased crime prosecution capabilities;
- to lead to increased privacy and data protection.
The impact of the research should be benchmarked in terms of future deployment, as proportionate to the risks being assessed, and taking into account realistically the expected improvements in performance, functional needs, conditions of use, future maintenance costs, and impact on operating procedures, including training requirements for new skills.
The outcome of the proposal is expected to lead to development up to Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 5; please see part G of the General Annexes.

Specific challenge:
 Approximately 70% of all cargo is transported in intermodal shipping containers representing approximately 240 million container moves in any given year. As a major trans‐shipment hub, the EU handles around a third of the container moves throughout the world. Container security associated with terrorist threats, illegal immigration, theft and smuggling is therefore an important factor in the overall EU border security.
 The greatest volume (and risk) of illegal/illicit/mis-declared goods into the EU, as of interest to Customs, include, but are not limited to: illicit narcotics (heroin, cocaine, etc.) explosives, tobacco products, chemicals. Intelligence together with scanning is useful in narrowing suspicious consignments, but ultimately a physical examination of the load is required. This is resource intensive and adds cost and delay to importers, should the anomaly be found to be benign.
 Scope:
 Customs currently employ a limited amount of technology to assist in working on its largest problem: how to counter hiding/smuggling in large volume freight. Thus far the technology of choice is X-ray interrogation (supported by risk-selection). Ideally, upon effective risk selection, the most effective (array of) technology out of a number of availabilities should be selected to screen the freight. The best results (relative low false-positive, relative low false negative) is expected to be achieved in a situation in which (at least) two independent  technologies are employed in conjunction.
 The research should explore options for parallel development of at least two different technologies for container scanning, for instance:
1)      Atomic property based interrogation (e.g. X-ray, muon, neutron), particularly to detect threat materials shielded in dense cargos, interrogation technology being directed towards the detection of organic products of relevance to Customs;
2)      Evaporation based interrogation (e.g. mass spectrometry, biological detection, ion mobility spectrometry), with targeted selectivity at approximately femtogram/ litre level, to be directed towards a wider scope.
 It is difficult to predict a priori which technology would yield the most practical solution. Therefore, these combined approaches should be validated in an operational scenario, to come up with practical, wide scope, detection tool  to be used on large volume freight (e.g. containers and large pallets).  The solutions proposed should address the employment of innovative technologies, which have been demonstrated to be able to dramatically enhance the performance of imaging and sensor systems.
 Proposals addressing this topic may involve the use of classified background information (EU or national) or the production of security sensitive results. As such, certain project deliverables may require security classification. The final decision on the classification of projects is subject to the security evaluation.
 The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between €5m and €12m would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
In line with the EU's strategy for international cooperation in research and innovation[1] international cooperation is encouraged, and in particular with international research partners involved in ongoing discussions and workshops, and US homeland security research entities. Funding for third countries is however still subject to the  evaluations.
 Expected impact:
The research is expected to provide a substantial contribution in the prevention of the unlawful transport of dangerous and illicit materials, also protecting critical elements of the supply chain from attacks and disruptions. A technology which could scan a load with high probability of detection of particular key commodities would increase efficiency and throughput and reduce cost and delays to innocent shippers. Solutions are therefore to be developed to allow for an increased assurance level in particular for dense containerised cargo, avoiding the need to unnecessarily resorting to physical inspection. As the research should facilitate and expedite the smooth flow of legitimate international trade through improved security controls, it would support the work of WCO for high risk cargo.
 The outcome of the proposal is expected to lead to development up to Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 7; please see part G of the General Annexes.

Specific challenge:
Civilian intervention staff in humanitarian missions is quite often at risk due to the instability of the countries of deployment and possibly due to the action of adversary forces still trying to gain the control of the country, the population and offered support. Their security is of a paramount importance.
Scope:
Proposals should address the problem of tracking (from the headquarters) the assets (e.g. Automatic Vehicle Location – AVL – technologies) and the staff of the missions deployed in third countries for instance in the CSDP context. Real-time tracking may help to reduce the exposure to security risks of these missions. The proposed solution should integrate and/or complement seamlessly the communication system in use (either standard or specific) and, if any, the Control and Command system in place (even if abroad). It must integrate features to assure its own security not being usable if in wrong hands. It should also integrate navigation/guidance (in the field) of assets and staff, using European GNSS where appropriate. Cost effectiveness should be considered (both acquisition and operation) as clients are quite often NGOs with limited resources.

In a context of growing demand for resources and competition for land use, sustainably capturing the potential of seas and oceans is critical for the European Union. New markets, services and products will only arise from innovative, resource-efficient and integrated approaches which cut across economic sectors such as marine biomass integrated bio-refineries. Despite the large potential of products derived from algae, implementation is still limited mainly due to unfavourable economics. At present, microalgae are being applied in a limited volume (< 10 000 tonnes dry weight/year) in various niche markets (including food supplements) and macroalgae mass production is facing several challenges including the lack of space to further expand. To reach broader economic viability, costs of algal biomass production need to be reduced and the scale of production needs to be increased significantly. Even when the price of biomass production is reduced, algal biomass needs to be refined into multiple products in order to increase its total value and achieve economic feasibility. An integrated biorefinery concept of macro- or micro-algae and higher value bulk or speciality products can lead to economically feasible and environmentally sustainable processes. Thus, cost reductions in biomass production and harvesting in a sustainable way are essential for the further development and scale-up of the algal bioeconomy sector.
Scope:
Proposals should focus on demonstration projects that will scale-up the production and harvesting of integrated marine algae products and bring them nearer to the market in an economically, environmentally and socially sustainable manner. Although the focus is on algae that grow in salt water, fresh water algae may be part of the work as well. The work should build on existing or new marine and maritime technologies. Proposals should address key challenges for scaling up integrated algae production systems, for example higher yielding algae species, optimised operation conditions and energy saving, limited contaminants, recycled nutrients and water, optimal CO2 use, storage and preservation of harvests before treatment, etc. Proposals should adopt a holistic, life-cycle approach and assess the broader environmental impact, for example from investigating the conditions for the access to sites, up to reducing the impact on the environment and improving education and skills in these sectors. Stakeholder engagement across the value chain, environmental and social acceptance should also be investigated, with the involvement of representatives of the coastal communities concerned.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of up to EUR 11 million would allow this challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude the submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
In the context of the seas and oceans to optimise algae mass production and secure the sustainable development of integrated bio-refineries, proposals will:
Develop marine innovation by de-risking investments and demonstrating the technical and economic feasibility of environmentally sustainable large-scale algae biomass production for biorefineries producing a range of value-added products.
Bring to the market new, cost-effective and environmentally friendly technologies and production systems.
Increase stakeholder engagement in and societal acceptance of sustainable algal biomass production.

However, while an increasing number of marine derived products are becoming commercialized, increasing the efficiency of the marine biodiscovery pipelines and developing sustainable technologies using marine sources in an environmentally responsible manner are still important challenges to be addressed.
Scope:Proposals should aim to develop innovative approaches to address the technical bottlenecks of marine resource identification, sustainable supply, discovery pipelines (e.g. separation, structure elucidation, identification of the profile of bioactives, de-replication strategies, mode of action, etc.) as well as more efficient production in biological systems. Proposals should be industry-driven. Proposals should cover the innovation chain from research, to development, and proof of concept. Legal aspects linked to securing clear access to marine resources, including related infrastructures and bio-resources banks and collections, their sustainable use as well as Access and Benefit Sharing aspects, should be properly considered. Environmental viability of the proposed concept should also be taken on board.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU in the range of EUR 6–10 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected impacts:
Enhance the competitiveness and sustainability of European  industry sectors such as pharmaceutical, nutraceticals cosmetic, industrial biotechnology and fine chemical, through increased efficiency of marine biodiscovery pipelines;
Bring broad societal benefits, by allowing development of novel, improved or more economic and eco-friendly end-products and processes;
 Structuring of the European Research Area in this field;
Contribute to the implantation of the objectives of the EU Blue Growth.

","Coordination and support action
","27 October 2015
","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Combining several activities such as renewable energy, aquaculture, maritime transport and related services in the same marine space, as well as the introduction of multi-use platforms, has the possibility to dividing the infrastructure overhead and reducing the costs of offshore operations, and the demand on the space needed for different activities. One barrier to multi use of the oceans is that different environmental, safety and regulatory regimes and practices apply to different sectors and to different national jurisdictions. Furthermore, there is a lack of common understanding of the nature of operations within different sectors and the feasibility of combining these in a way that provides mutual benefits. The challenge is to identify the real and perceived barriers to integration. There is a need for a clear overview of compatibility, regulatory, environmental, safety, societal and legal issues within the context of the maritime spatial planning directive and how they impact on the combining of different marine and maritime activities.
Scope:
The environmental, spatial, economic and societal benefits of co-location of offshore and near-shore activities can be hindered by potentially inappropriate regulatory, operational, environmental, health and safety, societal and legal barriers. An overview of all barriers both real and perceived is required as well as an action plan to overcome these challenges. It is expected that stakeholders (industry, NGOs, governmental organisations, research organisations and representatives of concerned local communities) are actively engaged in work within this action. Projects funded under this topic will by default participate in the Pilot on Open Research Data in Horizon 2020, with the option to opt-out, as described in the introduction.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU up to EUR 2 million would allow this challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude the submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
In order to reduce costs of offshore and near-shore operations and the marine space needed for different activities, the project will:
Enable a full understanding of barriers and possibilities associated with combining marine activities.
Reduce risks associated with the commercial development of combined activities offshore as well as near-shore.
Concentrate marine activities to enable the more efficient use of the marine space with reduced environmental impact.
Enhance social acceptance of these new developments by local communities and society-at-large.
Increase development of European offshore activities that support the Blue Growth agenda.
Better harmonise regulations."

Combining several activities such as renewable energy, aquaculture, maritime transport and related services in the same marine space, including in multi-use platforms, can serve to divide and reduce the costs of offshore operations and the demand on the space needed for different activities. Research on multi-use platforms funded under the FP7 call ‘The Oceans of Tomorrow’ has already provided promising designs, technological solutions and models for combining activities in terms of economic potential and environmental impact. However, before reaching a demonstration pilot stage, further technological research and innovations are needed to reduce risks for operators and investors.
Scope:
Proposals should develop combinations of innovative, cost-effective technologies and methods including automation and remote monitoring technologies, flexible structures and facilities in order to test concepts of multi-use platforms leading to pilot demonstration phases. They should test the sustainable operability of co-located maritime activities around coastal or deep sea environments. They should also address health and safety issues associated with multi-use marine platforms. Environmental and economic viability as well as societal acceptance should also be investigated, especially by involving local communities. Proposals should capitalise on the results of EU and national projects including those testing business models developed for multi-use platforms for their economic feasibility and environmental sustainability.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of up to EUR 8 million would allow this challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude the submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
To reinforce European competitiveness in the Blue Economy, proposals will:
Bring technologies and selected designs of multi-use facilities at least to technology readiness level (TRL) 5, ensuring validation of technology in the relevant environment.
Reduce costs of implementation and increase economic viability of multi-use platforms for the European maritime industry.
Improve health and safety in multi-use marine platforms.
Secure acceptance of these new developments by local communities and society-at-large.

Innovation related to seas and oceans can play a key role in tackling global challenges such as the scarcity and vulnerability of strategic resources and can unlock the potential of a sustainable blue economy, while factoring in environmental and climate change risks. EU intervention is needed to create the conditions for mobilising investments while avoiding the costly duplication of work.
Scope:
Proposals should pool the necessary financial resources from the participating national (or regional) research programmes with a view of implementing a joint call for proposals with EU co-funding resulting in grants to third parties. In addition, proposals may involve, publicly-funded research performing organisations that will contribute with their own resources (in-kind contributions). In this case, the joint call should include a separate topic for the participating research performing organisations, so that they will implement the resulting transnational projects themselves. Their participation in the ERA-NET Cofund action must be mandated by the national/regional authorities in charge (usually the responsible ministry). Proposals should address various applications including environmentally friendly, secure and safe waterborne transport, offshore and sub-sea activities, aquaculture, biorefineries, desalination plants, etc. They should focus on overarching challenges such as: reducing underwater noise and emissions, reducing environmental impacts, minimising the carbon footprint, recycling, novel materials, advanced manufacturing technologies, sensors for navigation, observation, monitoring and the deep-sea environment. Proposals should also aim to implement other joint activities, including additional joint calls without EU co-funding, on open maritime and marine topics in line with the Strategic Research and Innovation Agenda and its Implementation Plan under the Joint Programming Initiative ""Healthy and Productive Seas and Oceans"" (JPI Oceans).
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of up to EUR 10 million would allow this challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude the submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
To contribute to the implementation of the European Blue Growth Agenda and marine and maritime-related Directives, proposals will:
Bring new knowledge-intensive products and services for marine and maritime activities to the market.
Increase the resource efficiency, security, safety and environmental compliance of maritime activities.
Help implement the European strategy on Key Enabling Technologies (KETs), in particular with regards to advanced materials and manufacturing.
Support trans-national, pan-European research networks and synergies among national/regional and EU research programmes.

Increasingly business and services are carried out within the marine space. Examples include: offshore terminals, aquaculture, renewable energy, marine biomass, blue tourism, surveying, environmental monitoring, accident response and clean up, and clearing of marine debris and other pollutants. Costs at sea are higher than for equivalent shore based operations and a significant proportion of them are associated with the support vessels which service these activities. Inappropriate vessels can increase costs because they may have limited operational weather windows, high overheads, slow speed, low efficiency and they may be generally ineffective for the task concerned.

The challenge is to develop novel specialised vessel concepts which are economically viable and environmentally friendly and which will more effectively serve coastal and offshore activities, thereby supporting European growth and employment through development of a blue economy.
Scope:
Concepts should be developed to a pre-commercial stage technology readiness level (TRL) 5 and include: simulation, model testing, consideration of the most suitable construction and production principles for small series or one off vessels of this type, environmental impact assessment, cost estimation as well as both the marketability (technology push), and the cost effectiveness of the offshore operations concerned (demand pull).

Specific challenge:The development of a new maritime economy necessitates tackling a range of technological challenges. One such challenge is the ability to remotely execute unmanned underwater operations ranging from simple observation/data collection and transmission of information to more complex industrial operations. Technologies deployed for maritime research (Remotely Operated Vehicles - ROVs, Autonomous Underwater Vehicles – AUVs) must be further improved, industrialised, i.e. made more robust, cost-effective, reliable and sophisticated (in terms of operating capabilities) and with increased autonomy. Another challenge is the ability to operate at even higher depths (down to 6,000m), and in extreme conditions (e.g. Arctic regions, with corrosive products, heavy/viscous liquids, high pressure - high temperature systems, etc.). The control of the potential impact on the environment of these activities is also important.
Scope: Proposals should address the innovative design of new underwater vehicles and robots and/or their main components required to work undersea. If relevant, proposals could go to the stage of demonstrators or prototypes. The areas of interest are the following:
Remotely Operated Vehicles and Subsea Construction systems
Specialised 'Robots' and Autonomous Underwater Vehicles, deployment, recovery and docking systems
Subsea 'factory' machineries.
Where relevant, activities should cover the development of European standards.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU in the range of EUR 8–10 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected impact:
Enable sustainable and safe offshore operations by European industries in extreme conditions (deep sea areas, Arctic conditions, corrosive products, high pressure and temperature...);
Increase cost-effectiveness and competitiveness of the existing and new offshore economy (including marine renewable energy);
Improve the scientific capacity to observe and understand the water column, the deep sea environment and their resources.

Specific challenge:The development of deep sea resources exploitation (particularly offshore Oil and Gas) is moving maritime operations to extreme pressure and low temperature conditions, with many unknown factors and limited response capacity.
As shown by the Gulf of Mexico accident in 2010, besides the lack of appropriate means to deal with a large scale pollution event at high depth/pressure, it is particularly challenging:
to predict and measure the evolution of the pollution (e.g. oil spill, chemical pollution), in order to balance efficiency of the response with its environmental impact.;
to design an appropriate response combining the right mix of interventions (e.g. mechanical collection, burning oil on surface, use of dispersants, bioremediation, natural dispersion or transformation of spilled oil…).
Given these challenges and to reinforce national capacities, the mandate of the European Maritime Safety Agency (EMSA) was extended to provide assistance to EU Member States to respond to pollution from oil and gas installations (besides pollution from ships).
There is a need to develop the capacity for rapid response to unanticipated and episodic marine pollution events in different types of oceanic conditions, including in closed basins and open seas, by advancing scientific and technological knowledge.
Scope:Proposals should aim at developing an integrated operational response capacity to major offshore and/or coastal pollution events (particularly oil & gas), including in extreme oceanic conditions. The integrated approach should combine oceanographic prediction of the pollution behaviour, understanding of the pollution impact including the role of marine microbial communities, use of physical, chemical and biological remediation and its impact on ecosystems, the use of specialised vessels and underwater (autonomous) vehicles. Proposals should improve the European operational response capacity to such events, with in particular integrated models and tools that can be tested for a better preparedness and support decision making in the management of such events. They should also cover, as appropriate, recommendations for infrastructure works to help protect sensitive ecosystems in high risk areas.
In line with the objectives of the EU strategy for international cooperation in research and innovation (COM (2012) 497), proposals should benefit from the inclusion of partners established in third countries, in particular the US and Canada[1], given the high potential for knowledge sharing in this field[2].
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU in the range of EUR 4–6 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected impact:
         Develop an integrated capacity to optimally respond to major marine pollution events (particularly oil & gas) combining oceanographic modelling of pollution behaviour, physical, chemical and biological mitigation as well as infrastructures;
         Mitigate negative impacts of marine pollution on the marine environment, coastal economies and communities;
         Improve the integration between the scientific community and relevant government agencies charged with dealing with pollution, including cross-border and trans-boundary co-operation;
         Reduce risks of the new offshore economy and improve the business environment for Blue Growth investments;
         Contribute to the implementation of the Directive 2013/30/EU on safety of offshore oil and gas prospection, exploration and production activities and to the Offshore Protocol of the Barcelona Convention in the Mediterranean;

","26 June 2014","Scope:
Specific challenge: Acoustic and imaging technologies (including LiDAR[1]), combined with data processing  have made considerable progress in the past 20 years and can provide remarkable insights into the state of marine ecosystems, from the water column to the seabed (and its habitats).
Acoustic technologies can be active (echosounder, multibeam sonar) or passive (devices to 'listen' and interpret marine sounds). They operate from a wide range of platforms, offer promising perspectives for characterising seabed and sea column habitats, species and ecology and can strongly support marine environment and fisheries management, as well as offshore activities and safety (e.g. detection of seeps, geologic events… etc.).
Imaging technologies have also proven to be powerful instruments to characterise the marine environment, its biomass, biodiversity, detect and provide estimates of pollution and marine litter. They can therefore be of important support to marine environment and fisheries management (e.g. marine litter assessment for the Marine Strategy Framework Directive - MSFD). However improvement is still needed to increase performance and cost efficiency of these technologies, whether it is to monitor the oceans, or to support marine industries.
Scope: Proposals should cover innovative technologies to improve the performance and the cost efficiency of underwater sensors and survey systems needed for acoustic detection, imaging or LiDAR, as well as the (fixed or mobile) platforms supporting them and signal and image processing to interpret raw data. Subsequent use of this information as part of an integrated framework of multi-modal data sources should also be considered.
Proposals should bring together marine scientists, technology providers and end-users (including policy makers), with a view to support implementation of MSFD, characterisation of good environmental status or to enhance a sustainable European maritime economy.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU in the range of EUR 4–6 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected impacts:
Strengthen the competitiveness and safety of the European maritime industry by developing innovative and cost efficient underwater acoustic and imaging technology devices and survey systems;
Support the implementation of marine environmental and fisheries policies (MSFD – CFP), including the objectives for detecting marine litter;
Support marine science and ocean discovery (seabed and sea column characterisation).

The Arctic is a theatre of profound transformation. Climate change is significantly affecting the extent and thickness of sea-ice, on snow cover on ice-sheet melting, on permafrost thawing, and on marine and land ecosystems. These changes are bringing with them both risks and opportunities, and an integrated and multi-disciplinary Arctic observation system is becoming essential for studying, forecasting and assessing changes that support the region's sustainable development. Improving and coordinating current capabilities for assessing and predicting Arctic environmental change requires the provision of data on a number of key variables of Arctic meteorology, climatology, oceanography, ecosystems and pollution at various scales. Monitoring and improved understanding of the Arctic climate system and its teleconnections, as well as of ecosystem change and the socio-economic impacts on offshore operations, new shipping routes, mining activities, tourism etc. are important prerequisites for effectively assessing climate change adaptation and mitigation strategies in the Arctic and elsewhere.
Scope:
An integrated Arctic observation system should close critical gaps with innovative solutions, as well as improve the integration and inter-operability of existing observation systems, also in view of data assimilation into models. The activity shall be based on co-operation between the existing European and international infrastructures (in-situ and remote including space-based) and the modelling communities, with the active participation of relevant stakeholder groups. In line with the strategy for EU international cooperation in research and innovation (COM(2012)497), the action should contribute to implementing the Transatlantic Ocean Research Alliance, the Sustaining Arctic Observation Networks (SAON) and the Cold Region Initiative of the Group on Earth Observation (GEO). It should have links to the relevant Copernicus and European Space Agency (ESA) programmes and infrastructure in order to maximise the synergies other European efforts to develop an integrated Arctic observation system. In particular, strong coordination with the on-going Horizon 2020 project which aims to develop an Integrated Atlantic Ocean Observation System [1] should be sought and with the relevant ESFRI research infrastructures. The activity shall support and promote the integrated use of Arctic land, ocean, ice and atmosphere in-situ and space-based observations from Europe, the USA, Canada and other international partners. Community-based observation programmes that draw on indigenous and local knowledge should be included and should form the basis for participatory research and capacity-building within Arctic communities. The action should ensure data interoperability through internationally recognised standardisation and quality assurance/quality control (QA/QC) processes, promote database integration and allow free and open access to all data and data products, following the GEO data sharing principles. It should make best use of reference sites (supersites) and should contribute to filling in-situ observational gaps through novel technology development, with particular attention to the gaps that may help improve the accuracy of predictive models. In line with the strategy for EU international cooperation in research and innovation[2], actions will contribute to implementing the Transatlantic Ocean Research Alliance. Due to the specific challenge of this topic, in addition to the minimum number of participants set out in the General Annexes, proposals should benefit from the inclusion of partners from the USA and from Canada[3]. International cooperation with partners from other Arctic and non-Arctic third countries would add further value.

","26 June 2014","Scope:
Specific challenge:The challenge is to conduct the Research and Innovation activities necessary to the deployment of an Integrated Atlantic Ocean Observing System (IAOOS), building on existing capacities on both side of the Atlantic. The Atlantic Ocean is the most prominent maritime domain situated at the doorstep of Europe. However, the sustainable exploration, exploitation and protection of this maritime domain require a knowledge base and predictive capabilities which are currently fragmented or not yet available. The creation of this knowledge base and predictive capability requires systematic collection of ocean observations recorded both remotely using Earth observation satellites and in-situ. Central to the development of the IAOOS should be the acquisition and use of in-situ observations and their integration with remote sensed data across the whole Atlantic Ocean in order to fill out the existing observational gaps. Applications based on the Copernicus Marine Monitoring service and the European Marine Observation and Data Network (EMODnet) may enable addressing this challenge.
Scope: The Integrated Atlantic Ocean Observing System initiative should cover the whole Atlantic with the objective to deliver the knowledge base supporting the understanding of the Ocean Process at the level of the entire basin. Another focus of proposals should be to fill the observational gaps regarding the in-situ part of the Integrated Atlantic Ocean Observing System including through the optimisation of existing systems and the use of new ocean observation technologies enabling reducing the costs of in-situ ocean observation and integration of the biological dimension into observing systems. The research and innovation necessary to underpin the full and open discovery and access to the ocean observations and facilitating the interoperable exchange of ocean observation as promoted through GEO (Group on Earth Observation) at the scale of the Atlantic Ocean should require the participation of international partners from both sides of the Atlantic. In line with the objectives of the EU strategy for international cooperation in research and innovation (COM (2012) 497), proposals should contribute to implementing the Transatlantic Research Alliance, launched by the Galway Statement[1] on Atlantic Ocean Cooperation in May 2013, and should benefit from the inclusion of partners from the US and Canada[2].
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU in the range of EUR 15–20 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected impact:
Enhance societal and economic role of the Atlantic Ocean in Europe.
Provide leadership for Europe in implementing GEOSS.
Increase temporal and geographic coverage of observational data in the Atlantic Ocean.
Integrate standardised in-situ key marine observations including biological, (meta)genomic data into process models and forecast systems.
Improve modelling outputs and reduce cost of data collection in support of ocean-related industrial and societal activities.
Increase competitiveness of European industry and particularly SMEs within the marine industrial sector.
Increase safety for offshore activities and coastal communities
Contribute to make better informed decisions and documented processes within key sectors (manufacturing, ICT, maritime industry, environment technology, marine science and fisheries).
Improve the implementation of European maritime and environmental policies (e.g. Marine Strategy Framework Directive, Common Fisheries Policy, EU Integrated Maritime Policy).

","Research and Innovation action
","27 October 2015
","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
The climate is changing more rapidly in the Arctic than in any other region. There is evidence that these changes strongly affect ecosystems, people and communities inside and outside of the Arctic, including in Europe and North America. A better representation of processes specific to the Arctic (e.g. related to sea-ice formation and melting) in weather and climate models is required to better constrain the role of the Arctic in the global climate system and in the generation of extreme weather events. In connection with improved observations in the Arctic (see topic BG-09), this is necessary to improve the predictability of weather and climate in the Northern Hemisphere, and of related risks.
Scope:
Proposals should develop innovative approaches to improving the descriptions and modelling of the mechanisms, processes and feedback affecting Arctic climate change and its impacts on the weather and climate of the Northern Hemisphere, to further develop state-of-the-art climate models and predictions. Model performance should be assessed, and their ability to represent the links between polar and lower latitudes should be evaluated through coordinated model experiments. Actions should also explore the potential that an improved Arctic observation system – the subject of another topic in this call – would have on the accuracy of weather, and climate forecasts in the Northern Hemisphere, including Europe and North America, and also should identify gaps in data and observations. The activities should contribute to the programme of the Year of Polar Prediction (YOPP)[1] and provide input to the improvement of short- to medium-term predictions of the Copernicus Climate Change Services (C3S)[2]. Proposals should include a work-package to cluster with other projects financed under this topic and if possible also under other parts of Horizon 2020, and should build on projects funded under earlier calls. Links with projects resulting from the Belmont Forum call on climate predictability[3] are also welcome. Proposals should develop relevant forms of communication with the EU (and possibly national) services to adequately disseminate results that could be used for policy action. In line with the strategy for EU international cooperation in research and innovation[4], actions should contribute to implementing the Transatlantic Ocean Research Alliance. Due to the specific challenge of this topic, in addition to the minimum number of participants set out in the General Annexes, proposals should benefit from the inclusion of partners from the USA and from Canada[5]. International cooperation with partners from other Arctic and non-Arctic third countries is also strongly encouraged.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 7 million and EUR 8 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude the submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Projects funded under this topic will by default participate in the Pilot on Open Research Data in Horizon 2020, with the option to opt-out, as described in the introduction[6].
Expected Impact:
The project results are expected to:
Improve capacity to predict the weather and climate of the Northern Hemisphere, and make it possible to better forecast of extreme weather phenomena;
Improve the capacity to respond to the impact of climatic change on the environment and human activities in the Arctic, both in the short and longer term;
Improve the capacity of climate models to represent Arctic warming and its impact on regional and global atmospheric and oceanic circulation;
Improve the uptake of measurements from satellites by making use of new Earth observation assets;
Lead to optimised observation systems for various modelling applications;
Contribute to a robust and reliable forecasting framework that can help meteorological and climate services to deliver better predictions, including at sub-seasonal and seasonal time scales;
Improve stakeholders’ capacity to adapt to climate change;
Contribute to better servicing the economic sectors that rely on improved forecasting capacity (e.g. shipping, mining);
Contribute to the Year of Polar Prediction (YOPP) and IPCC scientific assessments, and to the Copernicus Climate Change (C3S) services.
Improve the professional skills and competences for those working and being trained to work within this subject area.

","08 September 2020","Specific Challenge:
Fisheries, an important part of the blue economy, provides food, generates gross profit of around EUR 1,342 billion and accounts for more than 150,000[1] jobs, and contributes to coastal social cohesion and resilience. The Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) regulates access to and use of the marine living resources. The CFP seeks to apply the ecosystem-based approach to fisheries management, with fishing in line with the Maximum Sustainable Yield concept and minimizing the effect of fishing on the ecosystem[2]. The Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD) requires that fish and shellfish stocks are in good environmental status[3]. The Maritime Spatial Planning Directive[4] aims to regulate uses of the marine environment. The design of such policies can be better served with a holistic, integrated approach. For successful policy implementation an improvement of our predictive capacity of environmental impacts on marine biogeochemistry and productivity, food webs and ecosystem structure and functioning, is required. Considerable effort to scientifically and technically support these policy objectives goes hand in hand with filling considerable gaps in basic knowledge and providing predictive tools available for integrated management.
Scope:
Building on related work done in previous research and innovation framework programmes and in other EU-funded programmes, research activities shall fill in knowledge gaps which hinder an efficient, ecosystem-based approach to the management of fisheries (e.g. biological characteristics and assessment of marine habitats; links of environmental factors and abundance, health, growth, reproduction etc. of fish stocks and human health and consumption etc., taking into account sex and gender differences if and where relevant; relations of different trophic levels in the food chain; efficiency of management measures protecting the ecosystem, interactions with and impacts from/on other uses of the sea). The proposals shall integrate existing and new knowledge in modelling or other applied tools/methods which can be used by scientific advisory bodies in sustainable fisheries management.
Following the principles of responsible research and innovation, proposals will ensure that societal players work together during the whole research and innovation process. Proposals should also test the efficiency of the proposed solutions across Europe.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU in the range of EUR 8 million would allow this challenge to be addressed appropriately. This does not preclude the submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
In the framework of UN SDGs (1, 2, 7, 8, 12, 13, 14), the Common Fisheries Policy, the Food 2030 policy blueprint for food and nutrition security, the BLUEMED strategic research and innovation agenda and the Atlantic research and innovation cooperation, proposals will:
Improve integrated understanding of environmental impacts on marine ecosystem and food web structure and reduce uncertainties in future projections;
Improve fisheries management assisting EU Member States to comply in a meaningful way with the requirements of European and international marine related legislation;
Contribute to conserve and restore fish stocks, and to regulate harvesting of fishing and end overfishing including illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing and destructive fishing practices, and to contribute to the conservation of coastal and marine ecosystems;
Provide improved tools for ecosystem-based fisheries management which are tested, effective, discussed with scientific bodies in charge of advising on stock, fisheries and ecosystem dynamics and that are fit for the 21st century;
Ensure that the ecosystem-based approach to the sustainable use of seas can be applied by different public bodies and in the framework of different public policies;
Provide improved alignment of research and innovation processes and their outcomes with the values, needs and expectations of society;
Contribute to a thriving fishing sector and to a thriving European blue economy, including improved professional skills and competences;
In the medium term:
Improve the professional skills and competences of those working and being trained to work within the blue economy.
Contribute to policymaking in research, innovation and technology.

Specific challenge:The EU has been funding a large number of marine and maritime R&I projects spread across different programmes. Recent efforts have been made to monitor and facilitate access to information on these projects or their results. However, key tangible outputs are not always known or exploited when they could be of use to marine and maritime stakeholders, scientists and policy makers.
Scope: Proposals should develop a strategy to monitor and identify and select successful marine and maritime research projects in terms of outputs and impacts for the 'Blue Growth' agenda as well as support to the EU Marine Strategy Framework Directive. They should analyse key promising results, particularly those relevant for creating growth opportunities and social innovation. Projects to be taken into account should come from the Seventh Framework Programme ('Cooperation', 'People', 'Capacities' and 'Ideas' if relevant), ERA-NETs, CIP, Structural Funds and other relevant EU programmes. They should cover a wide scope of areas/sectors (environment, biotechnologies, food, transport, energy, ICT, materials, space, security, infrastructures…) including those that are relevant for maritime applications and the Blue Growth. Proposals should also consider and bridge with marine-related research and innovation activities to be funded under the various parts of Horizon 2020, especially through the Focus Area 'Blue Growth'.
Proposals should cover strategies for exploitation of research results including a targeted dissemination strategy towards key groups of marine/maritime stakeholders (including scientists and industry), as well as policy makers. Where relevant, proposals could be linked to the Competence Centre for Good Environmental Status, to be developed within the Joint Research Centre (JRC). Key marine/maritime events (European maritime days, large marine science/maritime industries conferences) should be used as dissemination/exploitation opportunities.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU in the range of EUR 4 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected impact:
         Identify and make available ready-to-use knowledge/results to advance the Blue Growth Agenda and/or support the implementation of the EU Marine Strategy Framework Directive and the revised Common Fisheries Policy
         Demonstrate value creation from research results that are transferred during the project

","Research and Innovation action
","15 October 2019
","08 September 2020","Specific Challenge:
The Black Sea contains the largest body of oxygen-free hydrogen sulphide-rich marine waters on Earth. Any new local, national or transboundary policy measures should consider its special ecosystem characteristics, its biodiversity and its submerged cultural heritage sites.
The European Commission has been supporting the work of researchers from all the Black Sea countries to advance a shared vision for a productive, healthy, resilient, sustainable and highly-valued Black Sea by 2030. The first step was a gap analysis and a Vision Paper: A Blue Growth Initiative for Research and Innovation in the Black Sea (May 2018), leading to the drafting of a Strategic Research and Innovation Agenda (SRIA) for the Black Sea basin.
The Vision Paper identifies a series of challenges for the Black Sea basin, which are driven by a range of human-induced and natural drivers, such as pollution, maritime transport, eutrophication, climate change, and coastal hazards. The abundance of gas hydrates is a particular asset of the Black Sea that represents both opportunities and risks. Fish stocks and species diversity are under severe stress, common surveys and monitoring can provide a base for better assessment, management and prevention. The area's marine heritage and its ecosystem services are also at risk. Black Sea societies can be more deeply connected through a bridge of knowledge, technologies, services and innovations. The EU is committed to supporting the development of solutions to solve these issues. This work will support several policies and international agreements such as the EU Integrated Maritime Policy (IMP), the EU Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD), the EU Common Fisheries Policy (CFP), the EU Neighbourhood Policy, and the Bucharest Convention[1].
Scope:
Proposals shall provide solutions for accurate predictive tools and capabilities to tackle the increasingly complex array of multi-stressors and their poorly understood interactions, including their connection with rivers flowing into the Black Sea.
Proposals shall address the fundamental Black Sea research challenges, that have been identified so far and others that may be defined as the priority-setting work proceeds, taking into account policy documents such as the MSFD reports of Romania and Bulgaria and the Strategic Action Plan of the Bucharest Convention. Proposals shall:
Develop innovative multi-disciplinary research, building on past and on-going regional, international, as well national and EU projects/initiatives, including research infrastructures, data sharing mechanisms that will generate the knowledge needed to increase ecosystem resilience (e.g. SEAS-Era ERA-NET, PERSEUS, COCONET, SENTINEL, Marine Copernicus Monitoring Environment Service, European research infrastructures such as EMBRC, Euro-Argo ERIC, ICOS ERIC and EMSO ERIC, Black Sea Economic Cooperation, DANUBIS-RI etc.);
Provide new knowledge to assess and mitigate the impacts of global climate change and the multiple natural and human-induced stressors in the Black Sea from land-sea interface to the deep basin.
Furthermore, proposals should provide scientific support to very early development of emerging start-ups in the region.
All data collected must be handled in line with commonly agreed standards and be compatible with EMODnet and clouds.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU in the range of EUR 9 million would allow this specific challenge to be adequately addressed. Nonetheless, this does not preclude the submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
Activities will support the implementation of the MSFD and the Bucharest Convention, marine and maritime research and innovation to create synergies, increase economic benefits, and reduce hazards for prosperous, resilient and empowered communities deriving interest from the Black Sea basin.
In the short term, activities will develop:
sustainable smart observation and monitoring systems, and assessment frameworks promoting governance for a sustainable ecosystem, mitigation of climate change impact and other stressors, and accurate forecasting for adaptive management;
a harmonised set of working methods, standards and procedures on all aspects of coastal and marine research. This would provide compatible data, information and knowledge at the sea-basin level;
facilities for promoting start-ups oriented towards the circular and blue economies in the region and
new marine-based technologies by harnessing the Industry 4.0 for the Black Sea to promote safe and sustainable economic growth of the marine and maritime sectors, the conservation and valorisation of marine cultural heritage.
In the medium term:
Improve the professional skills and competences of those working and being trained to work within the blue economy.
Contribute to policymaking in research, innovation and technology.
Activities will promote education and capacity building:
training and utilisation and transfer of technologies and knowledge for established and new marine and maritime-related jobs;
educational and vocational youth mobility related to the blue economy among the countries in the region;
enhanced science-policy dialogue in formulating coastal and marine policies and programmes;

","SME instrument phase 2
","03 March 2014
","17 December 2014","Scope:
Specific challenge:The potential of Europe’s Oceans, seas and coasts is significant for job and growth creation if the appropriate investments in research and innovation are made. SMEs contribution to the development of the 'Blue Growth Strategy' (COM (2012) 494) can be significant in particular in the fields of marine biotechnology (related applications, key tools and technologies) as well as aquaculture related marine technologies and services.
However, SMEs lack access to finance to develop their activities and the economic and financial crisis has made access to finance even more difficult. This is particularly true in the previously mentioned maritime sectors, where access to finance for SMEs is considered as one of the most important barriers for the development of innovative maritime economic activities[1].
Scope: Scope: The SME instrument consists of three separate phases and a coaching and mentoring service for beneficiaries. Participants can apply to phase 1 with a view to applying to phase 2 at a later date, or directly to phase 2.
In phase 1, a feasibility study shall be developed verifying the technological/practical as well as economic viability of an innovation idea/concept with considerable novelty to the industry sector in which it is presented (new products, processes, design, services and technologies or new market applications of existing technologies). The activities could, for example, comprise risk assessment, market study, user involvement, Intellectual Property (IP) management, innovation strategy development, partner search, feasibility of concept and the like to establish a solid high-potential innovation project aligned to the enterprise strategy and with a European dimension. Bottlenecks in the ability to increase profitability of the enterprise through innovation shall be detected and analysed during phase 1 and addressed during phase 2 to increase the return in investment in innovation activities. The proposal should contain an initial business plan based on the proposed idea/concept.
The proposal should give the specifications of the elaborated business plan, which is to be the outcome of the project and the criteria for success.
Funding will be provided in the form of a lump sum of EUR 50,000. Projects should last around 6 months.
In phase 2, innovation projects will be supported that address the specific challenge of Blue Growth and that demonstrate high potential in terms of company competitiveness and growth underpinned by a strategic business plan. Activities should focus on innovation activities such as demonstration, testing, prototyping, piloting, scaling-up, miniaturisation, design, market replication and the like aiming to bring an innovation idea (product, process, service etc.) to industrial readiness and maturity for market introduction, but may also include some research.  For technological innovation a Technology Readiness Levels of 6 or above (or similar for non-technological innovations) are envisaged; please see part G of the General Annexes.
Proposals shall be based on an elaborated business plan either developed through phase 1 or another means. Particular attention must be paid to IP protection and ownership; applicants will have to present convincing measures to ensure the possibility of commercial exploitation ('freedom to operate').
 Proposals shall contain a specification for the outcome of the project, including a first commercialisation plan, and criteria for success.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 0.5 and 2.5 million would allow phase 2 to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts. Projects should last between 12 and 24 months.
In addition, in phase 3, SMEs can benefit from indirect support measures and services as well as access to the financial facilities supported under Access to Risk Finance of this work programme.
Successful beneficiaries will be offered coaching and mentoring support during phase 1 and phase 2. This service will be accessible via the Enterprise Europe Network and delivered by a dedicated coach through consultation and signposting to the beneficiaries. The coaches will be recruited from a central database managed by the Commission and have all fulfilled stringent criteria with regards to business experience and competencies. Throughout the three phases of the instrument, the Network will complement the coaching support by providing access to its innovation and internationalisation service offering. This could include, for example, depending on the need of the SME, support in identifying growth potential, developing a growth plan and maximising it through internationalisation; strengthening the leadership and management skills of individuals in the senior management team and developing in-house coaching capacity; developing a marketing strategy or raising external finance.
Expected impact:
         Enhancing profitability and growth performance of SMEs by combining and transferring new and existing knowledge into innovative, disruptive and competitive solutions seizing European and global business opportunities.
         Market uptake and distribution of innovations tackling the specific challenge of Blue Growth in a sustainable way.
         Increase of private investment in innovation, notably leverage of private co-investor and/or follow-up investments.
         The expected impact should be clearly described in qualitative and quantitative terms (e.g. on turnover, employment, market seize, IP management, sales, return on investment and profit).

  Specific challenge:The potential of Europe’s Oceans, seas and coasts is significant for job and growth creation if the appropriate investments in research and innovation are made. SMEs contribution to the development of the 'Blue Growth Strategy' (COM (2012) 494) can be significant in particular in the fields of marine biotechnology (related applications, key tools and technologies) as well as aquaculture related marine technologies and services.
However, SMEs lack access to finance to develop their activities and the economic and financial crisis has made access to finance even more difficult. This is particularly true in the previously mentioned maritime sectors, where access to finance for SMEs is considered as one of the most important barriers for the development of innovative maritime economic activities[1].
Scope: Scope: The SME instrument consists of three separate phases and a coaching and mentoring service for beneficiaries. Participants can apply to phase 1 with a view to applying to phase 2 at a later date, or directly to phase 2.
In phase 1, a feasibility study shall be developed verifying the technological/practical as well as economic viability of an innovation idea/concept with considerable novelty to the industry sector in which it is presented (new products, processes, design, services and technologies or new market applications of existing technologies). The activities could, for example, comprise risk assessment, market study, user involvement, Intellectual Property (IP) management, innovation strategy development, partner search, feasibility of concept and the like to establish a solid high-potential innovation project aligned to the enterprise strategy and with a European dimension. Bottlenecks in the ability to increase profitability of the enterprise through innovation shall be detected and analysed during phase 1 and addressed during phase 2 to increase the return in investment in innovation activities. The proposal should contain an initial business plan based on the proposed idea/concept.
The proposal should give the specifications of the elaborated business plan, which is to be the outcome of the project and the criteria for success.
Funding will be provided in the form of a lump sum of EUR 50,000. Projects should last around 6 months.
In phase 2, innovation projects will be supported that address the specific challenge of Blue Growth and that demonstrate high potential in terms of company competitiveness and growth underpinned by a strategic business plan. Activities should focus on innovation activities such as demonstration, testing, prototyping, piloting, scaling-up, miniaturisation, design, market replication and the like aiming to bring an innovation idea (product, process, service etc.) to industrial readiness and maturity for market introduction, but may also include some research. For technological innovation a Technology Readiness Levels of 6 or above (or similar for non-technological innovations) are envisaged; please see part G of the General Annexes.
Proposals shall be based on an elaborated business plan either developed through phase 1 or another means. Particular attention must be paid to IP protection and ownership; applicants will have to present convincing measures to ensure the possibility of commercial exploitation ('freedom to operate').
Proposals shall contain a specification for the outcome of the project, including a first commercialisation plan, and criteria for success.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 0.5 and 2.5 million would allow phase 2 to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts. Projects should last between 12 and 24 months.
In addition, in phase 3, SMEs can benefit from indirect support measures and services as well as access to the financial facilities supported under Access to Risk Finance of this work programme.
Successful beneficiaries will be offered coaching and mentoring support during phase 1 and phase 2. This service will be accessible via the Enterprise Europe Network and delivered by a dedicated coach through consultation and signposting to the beneficiaries. The coaches will be recruited from a central database managed by the Commission and have all fulfilled stringent criteria with regards to business experience and competencies. Throughout the three phases of the instrument, the Network will complement the coaching support by providing access to its innovation and internationalisation service offering. This could include, for example, depending on the need of the SME, support in identifying growth potential, developing a growth plan and maximising it through internationalisation; strengthening the leadership and management skills of individuals in the senior management team and developing in-house coaching capacity; developing a marketing strategy or raising external finance.
Expected impact:
Enhancing profitability and growth performance of SMEs by combining and transferring new and existing knowledge into innovative, disruptive and competitive solutions seizing European and global business opportunities.
Market uptake and distribution of innovations tackling the specific challenge of Blue Growth in a sustainable way.
Increase of private investment in innovation, notably leverage of private co-investor and/or follow-up investments.
The expected impact should be clearly described in qualitative and quantitative terms (e.g. on turnover, employment, market seize, IP management, sales, return on investment and profit).

","Research and Innovation action
","27 October 2015
","13 September 2016","Specific Challenge:
The achievement of economic, environmental and societal sustainability of Blue Growth in the Mediterranean area requires that we understand and are able to forecast the evolution of the ecological, social and economic processes in the region. This must take into consideration the proper functioning of vulnerable marine ecosystems and sea-related economic sectors. In the Mediterranean region, several issues are specifically acute such as the vulnerability and poor resilience of ecosystems, the over-exploitation of seabed and biological resources, the severe pollution events and limited remediation actions, the drastic climate change effects, the frequent extreme events and geohazards, and the uneven protection of coastal infrastructures and populations. The EU is committed to supporting the development of solutions to solve the above mentioned issues through several policies and international agreements such as the EU Integrated Maritime Policy (IMP), the Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD), the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP), the EU neighbourhood policy, the Barcelona convention and more recently the EU BLUEMED Initiative[1]. One of the main goals of the latter is to create an interoperable, fully integrated multiplatform observing and forecasting capacity to support the conservation of biodiversity, and to forecast and manage risks and emergencies at the coast and at sea. The implementation of these policies and conventions requires a strong knowledge base and predictive capacities that are derived from Earth observation data. These observation data are, however, still very fragmented, or are even lacking for certain areas of the Mediterranean Sea, in particular in the southern part. They are also still difficult to access, partly because of the many initiatives and systems that exist. The challenge here is to conduct the research and innovation activities that are necessary for the integration of the existing Earth observation facilities and networks in the Mediterranean Sea building on relevant initiatives such as Copernicus[2], GEOSS[3], GOOS[4], EMODNet[5], ESFRI[6] and in particular all those with strong links to marine and maritime issues, and national initiatives. This would fill out the existing observational gaps, and would help exploit the relevant data to build the necessary knowledge base and prediction capacities.
Scope:
The research and innovation activities to be included in the proposal should contribute to the development of an integrated observing system for the whole Mediterranean Sea building on existing facilities (remote sensing and in-situ) and initiatives, and addressing both the open sea and the coastal zone. This should be based on open data and should facilitate easy access to those facilities and the data. Another focus should be on conducting the research and innovation necessary to underpin the full and open discovery and access to the ocean observations and to facilitate the interoperable exchange of ocean observation as promoted through the Group on Earth Observation (GEO) for the Mediterranean Sea. The proposal should also address observational gaps in the Mediterranean Sea, in particular those related to the in-situ component of the observation system. Optimising existing systems and using new ocean observation technologies make in-situ ocean observation and the integration of the biological dimension into observing systems more cost-effective. The proposals should also focus on the use of in-situ measurements to calibrate and validate relevant remote sensing data and products, including possible new products derived from space infrastructures such as the Sentinel and Earth Explorer missions that support the improvement and evolution of operational services in the Mediterranean Sea. The above activities should include the participation of international partners from the coastal states of the Mediterranean Sea.
In line with the objective of the EU Strategy for international cooperation in research and innovation (COM (2012) 497), proposals should contribute to implementing the Research and Innovation Initiative for Blue Jobs and Growth in the Mediterranean Area (The BLUEMED Initiative)[7].
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of up to EUR 8 million would allow this challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude the submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Projects funded under this topic will by default participate in the Pilot on Open Research Data in Horizon 2020, with the option to opt-out, as described in the introduction.
Expected Impact:
To contribute to the implementation of the BLUEMED Initiative's vision and its related Strategic Research and Innovation Agenda and Implementation Plan, in particular as regards the goal to develop an integrated Mediterranean observing system, proposals must:
Provide an additional European contribution to established global observing systems e.g. Copernicus and GEOSS. Provide a Mediterranean Sea Integrated Observing system as a component for GEOSS.
Contribute to increasing the temporal and geographic coverage of observational data in the Mediterranean Sea and identify observational gaps.
Provide qualified data to improve the predictive capacity of model products and improve the cost effectiveness of data collection in support of ocean-related industrial and societal activities.
Improve the knowledge base that is needed in order to cope with global challenges such as climate change, scarcity of natural resources and regional hazards; this would make it possible to make better-informed decisions within key sectors, and increase the safety of offshore activities and coastal communities.
Improve the implementation of European maritime and environmental policies and international agreements (e.g. Marine Strategy Framework Directive, INSPIRE Directive[8] , Common Fisheries Policy, EU Integrated Maritime Policy, the Barcelona convention) by providing the knowledge base needed to support policy decisions towards the sustainable growth of the EU Mediterranean marine and maritime economy.
Improve the professional skills and competences of those working and being trained to work within the blue economy.

Specific Challenge: Marine and Maritime scientific and technological cooperation is instrumental in building dialogue, sharing knowledge and mutual understanding between different scientific communities, cultures and societies. It is a key component to tackle major societal challenges, underpin policies, and stimulate innovation. The EU has adopted various initiatives including the 'Blue Growth', the EU Atlantic Strategy and its Action Plan (2014 – 2020) to increase such cooperation. Furthermore the Galway Statement and the recently endorsed Atlantic Ocean Research Alliance[1] provides a unique framework for stimulating strategic cooperation between education, research, technology and industrial communities in order to jointly address challenges related to the sustainable exploitation of the Atlantic resources and thus promote economic growth and jobs for citizens and societies of both sides of the Atlantic.
However, further efforts are needed to create appropriate operational conditions among the relevant marine research and innovation activities and programmes related to the Atlantic ocean with a view to enhance their effectiveness and impact and facilitate synergies and allow for new collaboration initiatives.
Scope: In line with the objectives of the EU strategy for international cooperation in research and innovation (COM (2012) 497), proposals should contribute to implementing the Transatlantic Research Alliance, launched by the Galway Statement on Atlantic Ocean Cooperation in May 2013, and should benefit from the inclusion of partners from the US and Canada[2]. Proposals should underpin the establishment and implementation of the Atlantic Ocean Cooperation between the EU, its Member States and partner countries joining transatlantic research alliance as well as building on existing initiatives and programmes to increase coherence and coordination of ocean research cooperation programmes.
Proposals should address the following priority areas in an integrated way, identified in the Galway Statement:
(i) Marine ecosystem-approach, (ii) Observing systems, (ii) Marine biotechnology , (iii) Aquaculture (iv) Ocean literacy – engaging with society, (v) seabed and benthic habitat mapping.
Within these priority areas, proposals should facilitate the mapping and connectivity of relevant on-going research activities and programmes in the Atlantic and the identification of research gaps. Proposals should also consider ongoing work to create a European Marine Observation and Data Network (EMODnet). Proposals should contribute to aligning the planning and programming of research activities, in view of launching joint Research & Innovation initiatives, while building on existing ones (e.g. Joint programming Initiative ""Healthy and Productive Seas and Oceans"", marine ERA-NETs (e.g. Seas-Era) and also national and multilateral initiatives). Proposals should facilitate a shared use of infrastructures, as well as dissemination and knowledge transfer activities leading to an optimal exploitation of projects results, fostering mobility and networking of researchers.
Proposals should also establish a long-term knowledge sharing platform (existing knowledge or to be generated), in the areas mentioned above, to allow for long-term usability of the data, information and knowledge thereby ensuring tangible value creation from invested resources. This platform should comprise a classification system, which allows for an easy, focused, quick and reliable use and analysis of the information collected and stored. The principle of open access would need to govern such a platform. To enhance the exploitability of the platform for policy making and stakeholder consultation purposes, representatives from funding agencies and these communities should be consulted in their design. Options to secure the long-term viability of this platform should be included in the proposal. Cooperation is as well encouraged with partners established in other third countries (e.g. Brazil)[3].
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU in the range of EUR 3.5 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected impact:
Support the implementation of the Galway Statement on an Atlantic Ocean Research Alliance.
Improve the international cooperation framework of marine research programmes thus creating the basis for the development of future large-scale joint international marine research programmes.
Establish a long term knowledge sharing platform for easy access to available information and data holding significant commercial potential relevant to the EU Blue Growth Agenda

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Efficient implementation of EU marine and fisheries policies relies on the provision of adequate, accurate and timely data on the diversity and abundance of marine species and the functioning of marine ecosystems. Legislation such as the Data Collection Framework Regulation for the EU Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) and the Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD) as well as international agreements on biodiversity require effective monitoring and reporting to assess abundance and diversity of fish stocks and to support the definition of a good environmental status and progress towards its achievement. Conventional marine monitoring though sampling and the use of research vessels is costly and often invasive or lethal for the targeted biota. Progress in remote sensing and image processing technology offers the potential possibility to characterise and quantify pelagic fish species more efficiently using a non-invasive, automated opto-acoustic system which could be deployed in a single location without the need for a support vessel.
Scope:
Proposals should develop a non-invasive, opto-acoustic system which can simultaneously quantify fish abundance, biomass, and diversity (at least 4 species) as well as other MFSD-relevant parameters through a further set of environmental instrumentation which can be linked to these data. The optical part should use low light levels. Mechanisms should be developed that translate information from the near field and far field and to effectively blend the data. The complete system should work autonomously, continuously and non-invasively over extended periods of time to enable the collation of representative data sets. The system should be tested in at least two underwater observatories and comparable data should be used for validation and calibration. The system should be developed to a pre commercial stage (TRL6). The monitoring systems data should comply with European and international standards and respond to the needs of organisations performing fish stock and marine or freshwater biodiversity assessment. Work should take into account the existing state of the art, including research supported within Horizon 2020 and the FP7 Programmes such as Blue Growth Focus Area: ""Unlocking the potentials of seas and oceans"" in Societal Challenge 2 Work Programme 2014-2015, focusing on optical and acoustic underwater imaging systems.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of up to EUR 1,4 million would allow this challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude the submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Projects funded under this topic will by default participate in the Pilot on Open Research Data in Horizon 2020, with the option to opt-out, as described in the introduction.
Expected Impact:
Proposals will:
Improve the efficiency and reduce the cost of data collection concerning fish stocks and measurement of underwater biodiversity.
Support data collection and monitoring to address the implementation of European marine policies including the CFP and MSFD.
Advance the opto-acoustic technologies and their application in the field of autonomous underwater environmental monitoring, bringing them to at least technology readiness level (TRL6) to be used by monitoring performers.
Improve the quality of measurement and monitoring techniques available to assess fish stocks, biodiversity and possibly other MSFD descriptors.
Improve fish stock assessment and the related scientific advice offered to the EU.
Improve the professional skills and competences of workers in European industry and in particular SMEs within the marine and maritime sectors to develop and commercialised new technologies
Improve the provision of open access data sets concerning the underwater environmental status and fish stocks that are also compatible with existing major repositories (Emodnet etc)."

Specific challenge: Nowhere is climate change more evident than in the high latitudes. Increased shipping for transport and tourism purposes, highly variable fish stocks, increased oil and gas exploration and mining are challenges and opportunities faced in polar regions that require sound scientific knowledge of vulnerabilities and risks in order to develop appropriate regulatory policies. In the 2012 Joint Communication to the European Parliament and the Council 'Developing a European Union Policy towards the Arctic Region', the Commission and the High Representative point out that the EU will 'support research and channel knowledge to address the challenges of environmental and climate changes in the Arctic'. Rapid environmental changes in the Arctic and parts of the Antarctic continent have global impacts both by accelerating global warming and in a geo-strategic and socio-economic dimension. European countries operate world class research infrastructures in both Arctic and Antarctic regions and are leading in many fields of polar research with regards to climate, ecosystems, life in extreme environments, pollution monitoring and other aspects. Making the most efficient use of these resources and the latest scientific developments, for addressing the abovementioned challenges requires a high degree of coordination within Europe and beyond.
Scope: Proposals should coordinate polar research in Europe and develop a comprehensive European Polar Research Programme. By setting up a continuous stakeholder dialogue the action should communicate user needs to the appropriate scientific community and/or research programme managers. In line with the objectives of the EU strategy for international cooperation in research and innovation (COM (2012) 497) proposals should contribute to implementing the Transatlantic Research Alliance, launched by the Galway Statement on Atlantic Ocean Cooperation in May 2013, and should benefit from the inclusion of partners from the US and Canada[1]. Cooperation is as well encouraged with partners from other third countries, such as Russia, Japan, China, India and Latin American countries [2], also by supporting Belmont forum cooperative research actions. This initiative strives for enhanced coordination with international research organisations and programmes related to polar research (e.g. AMAP[3], WCRP[4], and JPI[5] 'Climate') as well as with relevant operational services including Copernicus. It is also expected to provide support to the coordination and optimisation of existing monitoring and modelling programmes and related infrastructures and work towards interoperability of and open access to observational and modelling data and related products.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU in the range of EUR 2 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected impact:
Substantially increase the scale and ambition of polar research cooperation in Europe.
Increase the coherent and efficient use of European resources.
Improve global cooperation.
Induce a step change in the domain of open data access, quality control and interoperability.
Contribute to policy advice at national and EU level and support to the EU's international commitments with respect to the Arctic Council, the Montreal protocol, and UNFCCC[6] and others related to polar sciences.

Specific challenge:Following the implementation of the actions foreseen by the Commission’s Communication on Joint Programming to tackle Europe’s major societal challenges, the Competitiveness Council has welcomed the progress made by EU Member States in Joint Programming Initiatives launched so far. Several Council Conclusions on Joint Programming invite the Commission to support JPIs via Coordination and Support Actions[1] to help achieving their main goals. By making more efficient use of MS investments and resources, JPI Ocean should help to address the societal challenges related to our seas and oceans, and consolidate the European marine research area.
Scope:Proposals should build on the outcomes of the CSA Oceans project in support to the implementation of the Strategic Research and Innovation Agenda (SRIA) of JPI Oceans and in ensuring further alignment and convergence of national Research and Innovation activities and investments on marine research in line with the European Commission Recommendation of 2011[2]. In this context, proposals should provide support for the designing and implementation of new transnational joint activities including joint calls if appropriate and using the most suitable and effective methods and tools for collaboration such as those proposed by the 'Voluntary guidelines on Framework Conditions', adopted by the High Level Group on Joint Programming. These new joint actions, in interface with other initiatives, should focus on relevant issues and grand challenges identified in the JPI Oceans' implementation plan and provide support to key marine and maritime related EU policies and strategies.
Proposals should be used to establish and consolidate an operational network of marine and maritime research funders and other key players in Europe, with a view to ensure alignment of national research agendas and actions implemented in the framework of other initiatives such as marine ERA-Nets (e.g. Seas-Era) and Article 185 initiatives (e.g. Bonus 'Joint Baltic Sea Research Programme).
Cooperation between relevant EU marine research institutes should be further stimulated for better coordination in the collection of marine data, the use and sharing of marine research infrastructures of transnational interest. Proposals should also include measures supporting other ERA priorities such as improving researchers' mobility and training. The international dimension of JPI Oceans should be further elaborated where appropriate and where there is added value, in order to achieve greater coherence at sea-basin and international level.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU in the range of EUR 2 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected impact:
Streamline effective trans-national European research networking and synergies among national and EU research programmes and Member States investments related to healthy and productive seas and oceans.
Progress towards the creation of a European Research Area in marine research.

","24 May 2016","Specific Challenge:
Following the principle of a circular economy, industrial by-products and waste from non-agricultural sectors, could be considered feed stock for bio-conversion into value-added industrial products.
However, most of these bio-waste fractions are used nowadays for low-value applications only, such as for energy generation in incineration facilities, as fodder in livestock industries and as fertilisers in agriculture. Therefore, responding to the need to improve industrial resource efficiency, the current main challenges are to identify economically viable links between waste generation and waste utilization, and to develop the necessary technologies (including biotechnologies) for bioconversion of waste into higher added-value products.
Scope:
The objective of this topic is to develop biotechnology approaches for the conversion of municipal solid bio-waste fractions and sludgy bio-waste from other industries, like the food industry, as well as from water treatment facilities, into higher added-value bio-based products, such as chemicals and chemical building blocks, biopolymers, materials and bioactive compounds. This includes sustainable downstream steps for product separation and purification. Physico-chemical technologies concomitant to the enzymatic/microbial processes are also needed. Proposals should address the current technical state-of-the-art regarding waste utilisation for bioproducts taking into account the current market and legislative barriers in the EU. The feasibility of integrating the newly developed approach into existing value chains should be assessed and demonstrated.
Proposals should have a strong industry drive and prove the techno-economic viability of the proposed value chain. They need to also take into account the optimisation of the final product's ""end of life"" through, for example, biodegradation or recycling. A life cycle assessment of the entire value chain should be included.
Activities are expected to focus on Technology Readiness Levels 3 to 5.
The participation of SMEs is encouraged.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU between EUR 5 and 7 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
Develop at least 2 new bio-based value chains, utilising either industrial by-products and/or relevant bio-waste fractions for bio-product generation.
Propose outline business plans which include the assessment of the potential impact of the proposed value chains in terms of EU jobs and growths in the short and medium term. The expected impact of the value chains should be clearly described in qualitative and quantitative terms (e.g. in terms of turnover, employment, market size, IP management, sales, return on investment and profit).
Demonstrate the environmental feasibility of the proposed value chains and conduct relevant outreach activities.
Proposals should include a business case and exploitation strategy, as outlined in the Introduction to the LEIT part of this Work Programme."

Systems biology deals with the understanding and controlling the complexity of living beings as opposed to studying their constituent parts. As such, systems biology can be considered as a cross-discipline, i.e. the integration of varied types of biological information and the development of models and networks, which together provide greater understanding of the biological system under study. Systems biology relies on cutting-edge technologies, including those in the fields of ""omics"" (genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics) and bioinformatics, all offering massive amounts of data, most of which remain stored and underexploited. Therefore, it is a growing area of science that builds information from the translation of biological data and strives to transfer knowledge to society in the form of valuable products and processes.
On the other hand, microbes are attractive candidates to serve as cell factories for the production of many valuable compounds useful for the food, feed, fuel, cosmetics and pharmaceutical industries. The current availability of genome sequences and metabolic models offers the adequate resources for the full exploitation of systems biology in industrial biotechnology, which can boost the design of novel and more efficient microbial platforms for the production of industrial compounds through the sound knowledge of their molecular constituents.
Scope:
Proposals should use systems biology approaches integrating ""omics"" data analysis, mathematical modelling and knowledge of interactions between cellular components under different environmental conditions, to enable useful applications for a broader set of microorganisms, while also achieving some of the following:
More efficient metabolic pathways of current microbial platforms, adapting them to high performing manufacturing processes
Improving existing cell factories or developing new ones with enhanced properties for harsh process conditions in industrial applications
Development of efficient cell factories for the industrial production of novel high-value products.
Identification of new microbial strains with beneficial characteristics for industrial applications such as those originating from extremophiles and related activities to develop relevant industrial host organisms.

","31 October 2017
","28 June 2018","Specific Challenge:
For years, industries have relied upon living organisms as a source of compounds or natural products, most of which result from interactions between them. Finding these compounds has very much depended on massive screening assays. Moreover, these compounds are chemically complex and their production often involves dozens of genes controlled by intricate regulatory networks. Both the nature of these molecules and the difficulties to obtain them via chemical synthesis have restricted their commercial utilisation.
However, now synthetic biology offers unique opportunities to create analogues of natural products or even to go beyond those. It has the capacity to modify the genomes of microorganisms, discovering novel routes to obtain complex chemicals, thus expanding the chemical diversity of molecules for the production of new compounds. The use of engineering principles and tools in biological systems overcomes the bottlenecks of molecules which are not amenable for large-scale production and expands the options of new compounds for applications ranging from medicine to agriculture and materials.
Scope:
Proposals will consist of the bioengineering of the genome of organisms (e.g. yeast, algae, bacteria) to be used in industrial processes in order to optimise molecular pathways. This should lead to the design and synthesis of naturally unavailable and efficient pathways for the production of new complex and high value added chemicals for the pharmaceutical, agricultural or material sectors. Emerging synthetic biology techniques (engineering of large genomic regions, synthetic regulation for the control of gene expression and gene editing, among others) can be combined with knowledge of synthetic chemistry, enzyme engineering, systems biology and bioinformatics.
Activities should start at TRL 3 and achieve TRL 5 at the end of the project.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU between EUR 6 and 8 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
New approaches for the production of complex chemicals;
Pathway design and validation for the production of at least two new compounds that would be difficult to make exclusively by chemistry, including an assessment of the related environmental benefits and risks;
Proved contribution to the standardisation of synthetic biology genetic parts and gene clusters."

The bio-based production of chemical building blocks from renewable resources has become an interesting alternative to inherently non-sustainable petrochemical-based processes, which are neither low-carbon nor resource-efficient. However, despite the discovery and development of numerous platform cell factories, bio-based production is not (or not fully) competitive in terms of economics and remains, therefore, a niche market application dedicated to high-value specialty products.
To overcome current limitations, it is necessary to further improve the efficiency of bio-based production processes by creating better performing platform cell factories and relevant downstream processes.
Scope:
The objective is to optimise already existing or newly developed platform cell factories for the production of platform and fine chemicals and biofuels (excluding pharmaceuticals), following the cascading use of resources. Proposals should include areas such as bioinformatics, systems biology and synthetic biology where appropriate. Furthermore, applicants should take into account integrated approaches from sourcing of renewable biomass to bioconversion and downstream processing, including the final consumers of the bio-based product.

A biological sensor involves an organism, or a biological component produced by an organism, and is used to detect target analytes. Biological sensors are used across different industrial sectors, capitalising on technical characteristics such as high specificity, robustness and adaptability. These enable detection of a potentially endless variety of compounds and conditions in different environments, a feature that can both deliver tailored treatments and facilitate automation, for example controlling the production process in a bioreactor.
However, the complexity of the biological mechanisms involved in the production of a new biosensor and the resources and time needed to develop and market new biological sensors limit their use on a widespread scale. Modern biotechnology offers tools for developing much more advanced biological sensors.
The challenge is to realistically engineer microorganisms that (1) use synthetic networks to expand the portfolio of molecules that are currently known to be detected by natural systems, and (2) perfect the networks for improved performance in given industrial settings.
Scope:
The aim is to re-programme microorganisms or synthetic biological systems with properties to be used as biological sensors in critical industrial sectors. Reprogramming microorganisms must comprise sensor, processor and reporter elements. Sensed molecular events will be associated with specific signal processing operations of synthetic circuits; processor elements will integrate multiple signals and reporter elements will be easy to read in low-resource settings. Proposals should:
Address sensitivity, specificity and the possibility of detecting multiple analytes. Portability and production costs should also be taken into account. Solutions may involve cell consortia, whole-cell, and cell-free systems;
Include demonstration activities at medium scale in order to confirm the performance and robustness of the reprogrammed microorganisms as biosensors in the selected application. Demonstration activities must incorporate biosafety in the design and development of a biosensor system both at technical and procedural levels;

Large-scale biological datasets (e.g. genomics, proteomics, metabolomics, epigenetics) have been populated thanks to modern high-throughput technologies, the decreasing costs of data generation, unprecedented improvement in data processing and analysis and the increasing capacity to save and store these datasets. However, less progress has been made in associating genome information (genotype) with the complex variation of observable traits (phenotype) of a living being. This knowledge is key to addressing important societal needs in a variety of sectors.
The exploitation of existing biological data types for an increased number of useful applications requires new computational and statistical approaches that integrate data and perform complementary analyses with the different –omics datasets. This is needed to draw meaningful information about genotype-phenotype associations that complete the picture of how biological models function and how phenotypes are established. An improved understanding of phenotypes will make possible the development of new predictive models for living beings applicable in different industrial sectors. Health-related applications have benefited from developments in this area and this could also be valuable for other areas of application.
Scope:

","29 July 2014","Scope:
Specific challenge: Biocatalysis is increasingly used in synthetic routes to complex molecules. However, the lack of a broad range of reactions platforms catalysed by enzymes and the long development timelines are hindering the full potential of biocatalysis. As a result, while the industry is in need of sustainable routes for a number of important chemical reactions (e.g. some oxidation, C-C bond formation reactions, etc.) biocatalytic alternatives with reduced environmental footprint are still not accessible to large scale chemical synthesis and other industrial conversions.
Scope: Development of specific robust biocatalysts for application at a large scale. Attention should be given to oxidoreductases, oxygenases, lyases. Proposals will have a strong industry drive and include demonstration activities to bridge the gap between lab and industrial scale and to assess the technoeconomic viability of the targeted biotransformation. Proposals should address the design and development of generic platform technologies and methods for fast and accurate enzyme activity determination and enzyme optimization enabling the design of highly efficient biocatalysts with an expanded range of substrates and for industrially important conversions. The development of methods for formulation and immobilization of enzymes could be considered with view to optimising process efficiency. Strong weight will be put on industrial leadership of the proposals which are aimed at introducing a real innovation focus. Activities will span between Technology Readiness Levels 5 and 7.
For this topic, proposals should include an outline of the initial exploitation and business plans, which will be developed further in the proposal project.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU between EUR 6 and 10 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected impact:
         The demonstration of biocatalytic routes to new chemical reactions at large scale will pave the way for a subsequent market replication. The industrial concepts demonstrated should have the potential for a significant economic, societal and environmental benefit.
         Enhancing industry's capabilities for design of biocatalysts (e.g. rational, computational) and their fast quantitative evaluation with view to ensuring the worldwide leading position of the EU biocatalysis sector.
         Increasing sustainability and competitive-edge of biotech’s concomitant sectors such as chemical, pharmaceutical intermediates, fine chemicals, food additives, cosmetics etc.
         Contributing to realising the objectives of industrial and innovation policy, such as the EU Strategy for Key Enabling Technologies.

","Innovation action
","11 December 2013
","29 July 2014","Scope:
Specific challenge: A general bottleneck for biotechnological processes is the fact that product concentrations are typically low and it is common that several by-products are produced. These two factors make downstream processing (DSP), isolation and purification having an important impact on the economics of the system causing up to 80% of the production costs. Achieving high efficiency at low costs calls for approaching the design and scale up of the bioprocess and downstream separations as a single integrated process. The development and demonstration of downstream processes is expected to unlock a number of biotechnology transformations that are not economically viable at present.
Scope: The aim is to develop and demonstrate downstream processes which overcome the often low and complex productivity of bioprocesses. This includes tools and technologies such as in-situ product removal, separation and purification technologies, newly developed materials (e.g. membranes, adsorbents, resins, etc.), reliable scale-up methods. Demonstration activities should aim at proving the industrial relevance of the developed downstream processes and their integration in the overall biochemical process. Strong weight will be put on industrial leadership of the proposals which are aimed at introducing a real innovation focus. Activities will span between Technology Readiness Levels 5 and 7.
For this topic, proposals should include an outline of the initial exploitation and business plans, which will be developed further in the proposal project.

Expected impact:
         Efficient and integrated downstream processes leading to a tangible reduction of investment and operating costs of the targeted biochemical process.
         Demonstration of downstream processes leading to a significant improvement of the environmental footprint of the targeted biochemical process.

Specific challenge: The large number of SMEs which characterise the EU biotechnology sector are playing a crucial role in the move to competitive and sustainable biotechnology-based processes. These SMEs are characterised by their research intensity and long lead times between early technological development and market introduction. They therefore need to be supported to overcome the so-called “valley of death”.
Scope:The SME instrument consists of three separate phases and a coaching and mentoring service for beneficiaries. Participants can apply to phase 1 with a view to applying to phase 2 at a later date, or directly to phase 2.
In phase 1, a feasibility study shall be developed verifying the technological/practical as well as economic viability of an innovation idea/concept with considerable novelty to the industry sector in which it is presented (new products, processes, design, services and technologies or new market applications of existing technologies). The activities could, for example, comprise risk assessment, market study, user involvement, Intellectual Property (IP) management, innovation strategy development, partner search, feasibility of concept and the like to establish a solid high-potential innovation project aligned to the enterprise strategy and with a European dimension. Bottlenecks in the ability to increase profitability of the enterprise through innovation shall be detected and analysed during phase 1 and addressed during phase 2 to increase the return in investment in innovation activities. The proposal should contain an initial business plan based on the proposed idea/concept.
The proposal should give the specifications of the elaborated business plan, which is to be the outcome of the project and the criteria for success.
Funding will be provided in the form of a lump sum of EUR 50 000. Projects should last around 6 months.
In phase 2, innovation projects will be supported that address the specific challenge and that demonstrate high potential in terms of company competitiveness and growth underpinned by a strategic business plan. Activities should focus on innovation activities such as demonstration, testing, prototyping, piloting, scaling-up, miniaturisation, design, market replication and the like aiming to bring an innovation idea (product, process, service etc) to industrial readiness and maturity for market introduction, but may also include some research. For technological innovation a Technology Readiness Levels of 6 or above (or similar for non-technological innovations) are envisaged; please see part G of the General Annexes.
Proposals shall be based on an elaborated business plan either developed through phase 1 or another means. Particular attention must be paid to IP protection and ownership; applicants will have to present convincing measures to ensure the possibility of commercial exploitation ('freedom to operate').
 Proposals shall contain a specification for the outcome of the project, including a first commercialisation plan, and criteria for success.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU between EUR 0.5 and 2.5 million would allow phase 2 to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts. Projects should last between 12 and 24 months.
In addition, in phase 3, SMEs can benefit from indirect support measures and services as well as access to the financial facilities supported under Access to Risk Finance of this work programme.
Successful beneficiaries will be offered coaching and mentoring support during phase 1 and phase 2. This service will be accessible via the Enterprise Europe Network and delivered by a dedicated coach through consultation and signposting to the beneficiaries. The coaches will be recruited from a central database managed by the Commission and have all fulfilled stringent criteria with regards to business experience and competencies. Throughout the three phases of the instrument, the Network will complement the coaching support by providing access to its innovation and internationalisation service offering. This could include, for example, depending on the need of the SME, support in identifying growth potential, developing a growth plan and maximising it through internationalisation; strengthening the leadership and management skills of individuals in the senior management team and developing in-house coaching capacity; developing a marketing strategy or raising external finance.
Expected impact:
Enhancing profitability and growth performance of SMEs by combining and transferring new and existing knowledge into innovative, disruptive and competitive solutions seizing European and global business opportunities.
Market uptake and distribution of innovations tackling the specific challenge of boosting biotechnology-based industrial processes driving competitiveness and sustainability.
Increase of private investment in innovation, notably leverage of private co-investor and/or follow-up investments.

Specific challenge: Europe lags behind other regions in technology transfer and the commercialisation of R&I. Lack of early-stage investment is a major factor contributing to this situation. Facilitating the interaction of potential investors with innovative SMEs and small midcaps participating in FP7 or Horizon 2020, together with preparing firms and entrepreneurs to negotiate more effectively with such investors, can help address this problem. In a complementary manner, investors can be trained to better understand the technologies and applications developed through FP7 and Horizon 2020 projects and thus make sounder decisions about their commercialisation potential.
Scope: Proposals should at minimum address:
1)      A survey of the major investment-readiness (training and pitching events) schemes in Europe, including those launched under FP7, such as the 'ICT Finance Marketplace' and 'European Investor Gate' initiatives.
2)      An analysis of lessons to be learnt from the above (proposals are expected to build on and reinforce the outcome of these schemes).
3)      The training of entrepreneurs (as the key focus of this action) and the sensitisation of investors.
4)      The planning and execution of pitching events.
5)      Strategies for involving a wide range of early-stage investors, including, at minimum, business angels, family offices and venture capitalists.
The main domains attracting equity investments for R&I — such as cleantech, ICT and medtech — should be targeted, along with a generic approach to other domains.
Proposers must have and must demonstrate a significant track-record in the investment-readiness field and also in-depth knowledge of early-stage investment.
Proposals must include a draft plan for the exploitation and dissemination of the results of the activities undertaken.
DG Research & Innovation will ensure that companies taking part in Horizon 2020's SME Instrument have fast-track access to this investment-readiness scheme.
Expected impact:
         Better overview of the investment-readiness landscape in Europe.
         More entrepreneurs better prepared to negotiate effectively with potential investors.
         More investors with a better understanding of the commercialisation potential of technologies and applications developed through Horizon 2020 projects.
         More investments made into early-stage firms.
         Greater commercialisation of scientific knowledge in Europe.

Throughout the three phases of the instrument, the Network will complement the coaching support by providing access to its innovation and internationalisation service offering. This could include, for example, depending on the need of the SME, support in identifying growth potential, developing a growth plan and maximising it through internationalisation; strengthening the leadership and management skills of individuals in the senior management team and developing in-house coaching capacity; developing a marketing strategy or raising external finance.
Expected impact:
Enhancing profitability and growth performance of SMEs by combining and transferring new and existing knowledge into innovative, disruptive and competitive solutions seizing European and global business opportunities.
Market uptake and distribution of innovations tackling the specific challenge of boosting biotechnology-based industrial processes driving competitiveness and sustainability.
Increase of private investment in innovation, notably leverage of private co-investor and/or follow-up investments.
The expected impact should be clearly described in qualitative and quantitative terms (e.g. on turnover, employment, market seize, IP management, sales, return on investment and profit).

Specific challenge:Metagenomics has the potential to provide unprecedented insight into the form and function of heterogeneous communities of microorganisms and their vast biodiversity, without the need for isolation and lab culture of particular organisms. Microbial communities affect human and animal health, support the growth of plants, are critical components of all terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems and can be exploited to produce fuels or chemicals. However, in order to expand their potential further, the metagenomic methodologies need to overcome a number of challenges such as those related mainly to standardisation of experimental design, screening, sequencing technologies and bioinformatics relevant techniques.
Scope: Proposals should address the development of technologies that form the metagenomic toolkit to guide future developments in the field with view to enable metagenomic approaches responding to societal and industrial needs. Similarly, epigenetic modifications and the RNA and protein data (e.g. on cell-cell level) could be addressed to elucidate functional dynamics of communities of microorganisms. Activities will span between Technology Readiness Levels 3 and 5.
 The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU between EUR 6 and 10 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
 Expected impact:
         Metagenomic methodologies to enabling enhanced understanding of communities of living organisms and empower agricultural, industrial, medical and other applications. This should bring significant and measurable improvements in productivity, yields, quality and functionality, as well as reduction of costs for the end-users.
         Reduced time-to-market thus strengthening competitiveness of European industry and SMEs.
         Identification of, for instance, human drug targets, commercially useful traits in agricultural plants, genes in microorganisms with industrial applications or unravelling pathogens, as well insights into microbial biodiversity for environmental applications.

The objective of this inducement prize is to improve the performance of software for the forecasting of geospatio-temporal data (collections of time-stamped records that are linked to a geospatial location). The prize will reward a solution which improves existing methods in terms of scalability, accuracy, speed and use of computational resources.
Expected Impact:
Many domains of societal or industrial significance, from epidemiology, to climate change, to transportation to energy production and transmission benefit from our ability to examine historical records and predict how the system under study will evolve.
In all these cases, it is not sufficient for predictions be accurate: they also need to be delivered fast enough for corrective action to be applied on the system observed.
The solution selected will demonstrate the ability to analyse extremely large scale collections of structured or multimedia geospatial temporal data in a way that is sensitive to the trade-off between the consumption of computational resources and the practical value of the predictions obtained. Datasets will consist of video collections and time-series recording weather conditions and parameters of energy grid operations.
This will not only result in the more efficient management of those domains in which spatio-temporal predictions are already used, but also in the applications of such predictive methods where today they are not, due to current limitations of speed, scalability, accuracy and resource efficiency. Possible domains of application include but are not limited to logistics, manufacturing, telecommunications.
This inducement prize also complements the activities of the Big Data cPPP which aims to develop Europe's data driven economy and the prospects offered by Big Data technologies (as outlined in the Communication[1] adopted on July 2nd 2014).

","16 May 2018
","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
The challenge is to develop scalable, efficient and high-impact decentralized solutions to social innovation challenges leveraging Distributed Ledger Technology (DLTs), such as the one used in blockchains.
DLT in its public, open and permissionless forms is widely considered as a ground-breaking digital technology supporting decentralized methods for consensus reaching as well as sharing, storing and securing transactions and other data with fewer to no central intermediaries.
In the wake of the widespread public attention for Bitcoin, several financial applications based on blockchains are already under development. However, the potential of DLTs to generate positive social change by decentralising and disintermediating processes related to local or global sustainability challenges is still largely untapped.
Social application areas in which decentralized solutions based on DLTs have shown clear benefits over conventional centralised platform solutions include, but are not limited to:
demonstrating the origin of raw materials or products and supporting fair trade and the fair monetization of labour;
allowing for a greater visibility of public spending and a greater transparency of administrative and production processes;
participation in democratic decision-making by enabling accountability, rewarding participation and/or anonymity;
enabling the development of decentralized social networks or clouds, or of decentralized platforms for the collaborative economy;
managing property, land registry or other public records; and
contributing to financial inclusion.
This challenge is targeted at a wide range of actors: individuals, social entrepreneurs, civil society organisations, research centres from technological and social disciplines, creative industries, students, hackers, start-ups, and SMEs. Tackling this challenge requires a multidisciplinary expertise.
Expected Impact:
Pioneering decentralized solutions to global and/or local sustainability challenges;
Generating positive social change by making available novel solutions for decentralizing and disintermediating processes;
Demonstrating the viability of solutions enabling a more even distribution and sharing of information and resources which respects privacy while providing levels of transparency.
Stimulating the emerging community of developers and practitioners of ""blockchains for social good"" applications."

","16 October 2018
","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
The global market for plastics continues to grow due to their physical properties and benefits such as light weight, reduction of food waste, durability and cost. After being used, plastics should be separated in order to be subject to the most appropriate waste treatment processes. This is increasingly difficult and inefficient due to, for example, consumers' inaccurate identification of the appropriate types of plastics for recycling. Other plastic types, such as polystyrene, can even not be recycled if they have traces of food.
Despite the worldwide efforts for degradation or recycling, large amounts of mixtures of plastics and other polymers end up in landfills or are used for the generation of energy. These methods lead to environmental contamination through the production of CO2 or due to plastics reaching water courses and the sea where they persist and become toxic for the whole food chain. Novel biotechnological approaches should be applied for the sustainable biological degradation of mixtures of recalcitrant and degradable plastics.
Scope:
Proposals will develop environmentally friendly and sustainable solutions for managing the waste of plastics mixtures based on the use of communities of microorganisms with a set of complementary enzymes. The enzymes may be native or engineered using state of the art biotechnologies. The microbial organisms will turn plastic mixtures into chemical constituents facilitating mineralisation, composting of otherwise recalcitrant and toxic polymers and facilitating production of high value products. Polymers such as polystyrene can also be included in the proposals.
Proposals should:
produce cocktails of enzymes using communities of microorganisms capable of degrading mixtures of biodegradable and currently non-biodegradable plastics into more basic chemical constituents;
use a multidisciplinary approach based on biotechnology;
create high value products and valorise mixed plastic waste.
This topic is part of the EU-China flagship initiative on Biotechnology for Environment and Human Health, which will promote substantial coordinated and balanced research and Innovation cooperation between the EU and China. China-based legal entities[1] have to apply for funding under the Chinese co-funding mechanism with the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)[2].
Activities should start at TRL 3 and achieve TRL 5 at the end of the project.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU up to EUR 5 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
A combination of microorganisms expressing at least three novel or improved enzymatic activities enabling the degradation of mixtures of plastics;
Degradation of at least 20 percent of non-biodegradable plastics found in plastic mixtures. The objective is to include relevant indicators that prove this impact;
Identification of the metabolic pathways leading to at least two high added value products that could be sustainably produced in future from plastic mixtures;
Description of a sustainable and environmentally friendly pilot system for the degradation of plastic mixtures.

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Environmental pollution is a major global issue affecting natural resources and the environment in generic terms and creating important concerns for human health in particular. Pollutants resulting from human action are detrimental to ecosystems at different functional levels, representing an important economic load for society.
Standard remediation strategies have different levels of efficiency; in certain cases they increase the health risk of workers or simply postpone the problem. Advanced bioremediation approaches, which use naturally occurring microorganisms, in the form of emerging technologies for the treatment of contamination in various ecosystems foresee more sustainable and gentle alternatives to physicochemical options. These technologies comprise, amongst others biomineralisation, electrobioremediation, microbe-assisted phytoremediation, protein and metabolic engineering, nano-biotechnology and systems biology.
While the merits of using microorganisms to depollute their environment and to transform harmful contaminants into harmless end-products are well known (environmental friendliness, low toxicity), a number of challenges remain. These include for instance, their effectiveness to treat compounds that are not biodegradable (e.g. toxic metals), time efficiency, specificity of the environment, level of concentration of the contaminants, the combined biological activity of the microbial community over time and space and the consumption of energy.
Scope:
Proposals should cover the following activities:
Research and innovation for efficient and low cost remediation strategies using microorganisms by means of emerging biotechnologies that require minimum or zero external energy or chemicals and that reduce the remediation time compared to physicochemical processes;
Work to ensure remediation in soil, sediments, mines, surface water, groundwater or industrial water;
Develop a system to remove different contaminants, including complex mixtures, covering hydrocarbons and their derivatives, recalcitrant compounds, metals, nanomaterials, paints and coatings, nutrients, pharmaceuticals or micropollutants and toxic contaminants;
Include field trials to prove an acceptable performance for field applications will be a plus.

China-based legal entities[1] have to apply for funding under the Chinese co-funding mechanism with the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)[2].
Proposals submitted under this topic should include a business case and exploitation strategy, as outlined in the Introduction to the LEIT part of this Work Programme.

Remediation of at least two toxic contaminants of different nature;
Proof of the feasibility to scale up the technology for field testing, including an assessment of the related environmental benefits and risks;
A quantified demonstration of the benefits compared to standard physicochemical remediation approaches, in particular regarding time and energy efficiency.

","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
The main market driver in the textile sector is the fast-growing demand for products and the need to respond to it without a negative environmental impact. The proportion of bio-based textile fibres has been falling steadily for decades, mainly because of the environmental limits of cotton production and the progress made (e.g. in terms of reduced costs) in the field of synthetic fibres. However, over a third of textile fibres are still bio-based.
A shift in the market from petrochemical to bio-based fibres will require new processing technologies and huge market uptake of sustainable bio-based materials other than cotton, wool and silk. Of all natural fibres, cellulose has seen the fastest increase in all textile substrates in recent years. Other all-natural fibres[1] are under development or have been introduced in niche markets. In addition, small proportion of new bio-based polymer fibres[2] can already be found in specific applications.
The challenge is to develop processing technologies and create an innovative and sustainable bio-based textile economy based on circular economy principles, thus making efficient use of resources, radically improving recycling, phasing out plastic microfibre release[3] and accelerating the development and adoption of sustainable circular business models.
Scope:
Activities should address:
the development of innovative, techno-economically feasible materials and processes for the production of resource-efficient, sustainable and functionally performing bio-based textiles;
the technical, environmental and economic aspects of bio-based textile recycling, focusing on quality, i.e. targeting up-cycling, or at least, recycling into the same or similar quality applications; and;
the use of new bio-based materials and the design of textiles that are either biodegradable or do not shed microfibers and have the properties needed for performance applications.
Work on the sustainability and safety of end products should embrace the use of resources as a whole and incorporate the established standards for products with a small environmental footprint, from life-cycle assessment to eco-labelling. In addition, activities should investigate the elements needed for the development of innovative circular business models for bio-based textiles.
In line with responsible research and innovation principles, activities should support the development of international fora and platforms that facilitate systemic innovation and uptake by enabling actors in the value chains, from industry to civil society and public authorities, to cooperate to improve circularity in the bio-based textiles economy. The interdisciplinary, cross-sectoral approach should also apply to training activities to improve professional skills and competencies, and to support the job creation in the bioeconomy.
Proposal should deliver solutions with work starting at technology readiness level (TRL) 5 and reaching TRL 6 or higher, where technological innovation is involved.
Cooperation with other selected proposals under this topic is encouraged.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting an EU contribution of around EUR 7 million would allow this challenge to be addressed appropriately. This does not preclude the submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
foster innovations that enable bio-based textile value chains to become more resource efficient, circular, and reduce their carbon, greenhouse gas and water footprint, in line with climate, energy and sustainable development goals (e.g. UN SDG 14);
prevent and significantly reduce plastic microfibre pollution;
improve the efficiency and technological performance of bio-based textile recycling;
strengthen the market position and increase the market share of bio-based textiles;
deliver results in a form that allows for efficient feedback into policymaking in research, innovation and technology, in particular in the EU circular economy;
demonstrate solutions and develop strategies for the circular innovation of the whole innovative bio-based textile system, building on a shared vision and enhancing cooperation between all stakeholders; and;
raise awareness and create a better framework for systemic innovation and uptake of results through broad stakeholder engagement.

","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Inclusive and sustainable bio-based business models (e.g. cooperatives, producer associations and higher-level structures such as clusters) offer a major opportunity for communities to combine the local creation of value, societal engagement and environmental protection.
This may lead to:
reduction of the negative environmental impacts of unsustainable production and consumption patterns;
greater circularity of local resources;
better use of eco-system services and goods originating in primary sectors (e.g. high biodiversity and measures to meet climate targets).
However, the adoption of such models is often hampered by factors at the level of stakeholders such as insufficient awareness, cooperation and innovation exploitation. The challenge entails developing strategies that deliver the above-mentioned principles, while mobilising stakeholders to adopt sustainable and inclusive business models, based on technologies and under-valorised or under-utilised resources, suitable for use on a small scale and easy to replicate and adapt to local conditions.
Scope:
The action will stimulate adoption of the business models by the relevant stakeholders (especially primary producers), with a clear emphasis on agriculture and forestry. It will achieve a sound geographical balance[1], and may cover all primary biomass sectors. Proposals should establish a pilot network of national/regional ‘bioeconomy clusters’ gathering relevant actors in the bioeconomy (e.g. EU, national/regional policy and funding bodies, industry, academia, farmer associations and cooperatives, industry, researchers, civil society and NGOs)[2]. These clusters should develop appropriate strategies for the deployment of bio-based solutions involving the primary production sector, tailored to regional conditions and assets, and exploiting synergies between policy instruments, such as the common agricultural policy, regional funds and relevant national programmes.
At a minimum, the action should help address:
lack of awareness and practical knowledge among stakeholders (especially primary biomass producers) as to the potential of sustainable business models in the bio-based sector to create economic, environmental and societal value through the production and/or use of hitherto unexploited bio-based resources;
low degree of cooperation and networking at all levels; and;
inadequate transfer of technology and exploitation of innovation, which too often impede uptake of these business models.
To avoid overlaps, this action will build on the state of the art including past and ongoing EU-funded projects[3].
The Commission considers that proposals requesting an EU contribution of around EUR 2 million would allow this challenge to be addressed appropriately. This does not preclude the submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
The action will implement the 2018 EU bioeconomy strategy[4].
More specifically, it will:

","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
The 2018 EU Bioeconomy Strategy sees cities becoming major circular bioeconomy hubs. Urban biowaste[1] and wastewater are circular feedstocks that can be used to produce innovative bio-based products such as bio-based chemicals, plastics and fertilisers. Moreover, the new EU waste legislation may lead to more quality biowaste becoming available for use in biorefineries. Nevertheless, very few European cities have developed circular bio-based economy strategies and projects for the production of innovative bio-based products. The challenge is to foster investments and to implement projects to valorise urban biowaste and wastewater through the production of innovative bio-based products within the framework of targeted circular bio-based economy strategies in urban areas. The EU added value can be obtained where projects introduce innovation to the market regarding financing solutions minimising transaction costs as well as where they demonstrably remove legal, administrative and other market barriers for mainstreaming circular bio-based investment schemes in European cities.
Scope:
Proposals shall provide Project Development Assistance (PDA) to a pilot group made up of at least 5 European cities (and/or clusters of cities) to build their technical, economic and legal expertise needed for leading to concrete investments in projects to valorise urban biowaste and wastewater through the production of safe and sustainable bio-based products, including the innovative ones. The valorisation of urban biowaste and wastewater solely in the form of compost, biogas and biofuels is not part of the focus of this topic. PDA shall support each city of the pilot group to bridge the gap between their plan/strategy to valorise urban biowaste and wastewater and the concrete investments for the launch and implementation of the respective projects. PDA should include feasibility studies, stakeholder and community mobilisation, financial engineering, business plans, technical specifications, procurement procedures, etc. Proposals shall justify the budget for the PDA provided to each city (and/or cluster of cities) based on the expected amount of investments to be triggered and the respective leverage factor to be achieved[2], where these expected investments and leverage factors shall also be justified. Projects and related investments shall be embedded in urban circular bio-based economy strategies embracing a wider sustainable and circular approach of the entire urban metabolism, where urban waste and wastewater are prevented, reduced and their recycling improved. Each city (and/or cluster of cities) shall include an agglomeration of a population equivalent generating a critical amount of urban biowaste and/or wastewater as feedstock for biorefining. The composition of the pilot group of cities (and/or clusters of cities) shall reflect a geographical spread within Europe and represent cities of different sizes and socio-economic structures to the largest extent possible. The involvement and proof of formal commitment of local and/or regional authorities at proposal stage is a precondition for the success of the project. An already existing practice of the separate collection of urban biowaste is an asset. The pilot circular bio-based economy cities should act as demonstrators with a view to transferring urban circular bio-based economy models all over throughout Europe and beyond. Proposals should support the creation of a European network to facilitate the exchange of good practices and lessons learned among circular bio-based cities. Cooperation with selected proposals under topic CE-SFS-25-2018 ""Integrated systems innovation in valorising urban biowaste"" is encouraged.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting an EU contribution of up to EUR 8 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. This does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
This action will contribute to the implementation of the 2018 EU Bioeconomy Strategy (Action 2.2. Pilot actions to support local bioeconomy development (urban) via Commission instruments and programmes) and the 2018 EU Circular Economy Package. Proposals are expected to demonstrate the following impacts using quantified indicators and targets when possible:
delivery sustainable circular bio-based economy investments and support the launch of the related projects embedded in urban circular bio-based economy strategies to valorise urban biowaste and wastewater through the production of bio-based products, including the innovative ones;
creation of a European network to facilitate the exchange of good practices and lessons learned among circular bio-based cities;
contribute to increased recycling of urban biowaste and wastewater, avoid landfilling and cut the respective associated greenhouse gas emissions; and
contribute to the creation of jobs in local economies.

Advanced chemical energy conversion, storage and transportation will play a key role in enabling the EU to develop a low-carbon economy and provide more flexibility. As such, increasing the exploitation of natural gas, stranded resources and biogas is creating new opportunities for the utilisation of low cost light alkanes. High value can be added through improved catalytic transformations to C2-C4 olefins, C-C coupling and/or C1 chemistry together with significant impact towards the climate action targets agreed in COP21. The integration of catalysts and process design will be instrumental in creating process improvements and flexibility as well as tackle the global climate challenges.
Scope:
Development of novel catalytic materials and routes for the valorisation of currently unexploited light hydrocarbons resources, bio- or stranded gas for chemical and energy production. Proposals should cover at least one of the following:
Selective direct conversion of light hydrocarbon resources (C1-C4 alkanes) to mono-olefins and/or butadiene, with improved performance (on energy/carbon bases) and competitive costs compared to existing industrial processes;
Conversion of non-transportable gas resources to liquid hydrocarbons (not passing through CO/H2 formation);
Novel energy-efficient and cost-competitive routes for the direct utilisation of light alkanes in the production of high-value chemicals;
Assessment of environmental and safety issues and should involve industries in a leadership role as well as validate the feasibility of the proposed route in industrial relevant environments.
In line with the strategy for EU international cooperation in research and innovation (COM(2012)497), international cooperation is particularly encouraged in particular with countries from the Broader EU Neighbourhood (e.g. European Neighbourhood Policy countries, Iran and Iraq) among others.

The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU between EUR 5 and 7 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
Novel catalysts and routes for the valorisation of currently unexploited light hydrocarbons resources will:
Reduce the dependence from the current fossil fuel resources (>30% reduction of current use of fossil fuels for the equivalent production);
Improve industrial competiveness by novel processes with improved energy efficiency (OPEX). Reduction of greenhouse gases emissions and investment costs (CAPEX) by >20% with respect to current production route;
Novel and scalable catalysts and catalytic processes which can handle feedstock variability.

The efficient storage and utilisation of solar energy in the form of chemicals or chemical energy will play a key role to transform the European industry into a low-carbon economy. In the long term, there will be a need for highly integrated solutions enabling the carbon-neutral production of high-value chemicals or energy, which is crucial to reduce CO2 emissions. The development of integrated processes will require a systems-catalysis approach that includes engineering aspects as small-scale and intermittent operation.
Scope:
Development of cheap materials and integrated processes/devices for the direct photocatalytic conversion of CO2 (from anthropogenic CO2 sources and/or from air) and H2O to fuels and/or chemicals, with an overall solar-to-hydrogen efficiency of >20%, with the following goals:
Improve selectivity and efficiency by rational engineering of the bandgap and electronic structures;

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Maintaining Europe’s position in research related to materials science and engineering requires concentrated action on common European research priorities in view of implementing joint initiatives.
The M-ERA.NET 2 network has successfully targeted the Low Carbon Energy Technologies addressed by the SET Plan. Now the scope should on one hand guarantee some continuation, and on the other hand become more ambitious and underline the commitment of the EU regarding the circular economy and Sustainable Development Goals.
The European Commission has adopted an ambitious new Circular Economy Package to help European businesses and consumers to make the transition to a stronger and more circular economy. Moreover, in 2016, the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development came into force. They aim to end poverty, protect the planet, ensure prosperity and tackle climate change. The EU is fully committed to be a frontrunner in implementing the 2030 Agenda and SDGs. Finally, the Commission launched the Battery Alliance initiative in 2017.
Materials research is a relevant field for addressing these overall challenges and for making substantial contributions to achieving the specific objectives.
Global challenges call for co-operation on a global scale to build capacity in science, technology and innovation (STI) at both national and international levels. A strategic and industrially relevant approach is needed that cover the entire research and innovation chain by pooling national research and innovation capacities, thereby mobilising European infrastructure networks as well as promoting education and training in materials research and innovation.
Scope:
The proposed ERA-NET aims at coordinating the research efforts of the participating Member States, Associated States and Regions in the field of materials, continuing the activities started by M-ERA.NET, for materials research and innovation, especially targeting the circular economy and Sustainable Development Goals (such as Goal 7 – “Affordable and clean energy”, by enabling electromobility through sustainable energy storage technology or Goal 9 “Industrial innovation and infrastructure”, by enhancing scientific research and upgrading the technological capabilities of industrial sectors). Proposals should pool the necessary financial resources from participating national or regional research programmes by implementing a joint transnational call for proposals (resulting mainly in grants to third parties) with EU co-funding to fund multinational innovative research initiatives in this domain, including support to the large scale research initiative on future battery technologies launched under the H2020-LC-BAT-2019-2020 Call[1].
Proposers are also requested to implement other joint activities and, additional joint calls without EU co-funding. The proposal should demonstrate that these additional joint calls exclude any overlaps with related on-going actions co-funded by the EU under NMBP.
Proposals should demonstrate the expected impact on national and transnational programmes as well as the leverage effect on European research and competitiveness, and should plan the development of key indicators for supporting this.
Participation of legal entities from third countries, and/or regions including those not automatically eligible for funding in accordance with General Annex A is encouraged in the joint call as well as in other joint activities including additional joint calls without EU co-funding. Participants from countries not listed in General Annex A are eligible for EU funding under this topic and may request a Union contribution (on the basis of the ERA-NET unit cost) only for the coordination costs of additional activities.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of EUR 15 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts. EUR 5 million of the requested contribution from the EU should be used as support to transnational projects, co-funded by the Commission, on future battery technologies, fostering synergy between European, national and regional initiatives and promoting broader partnerships between the European stakeholders in future battery technologies.
Expected Impact:
synergies with international, national and regional programmes that support research and innovation;
synergies but no overlap with the topics of Horizon 2020 and with related European Partnership initiatives and be open to adapt to future coming initiatives of Horizon Europe;
leverage of national, regional and European funding;

The main purpose of the Circular Economy (CE) is to develop material/product business models that are economically and environmental sustainable, with actions supporting each stage of the value chain (from production to consumption, from design to recycling and upcycling of waste-materials) while promoting industrial and social innovation. In line with this, the challenge is to evaluate product improvement, taking into consideration, all relevant subsystem interactions (environmental, economic and social) and all the life cycle stages of the product. However, although environmental indicators and methodologies for product level assessment are well advanced and harmonised (LCA-PEF[1]) this is not yet the case as regards the social and economic pillars of sustainability assessment. Life cycle sustainability analysis (LCSA) is needed, integrating social and economic benefits with environmental burdens, which fit these causal interrelations into an holistic approach understandable to different stakeholders.
Scope:
Develop approaches/methodologies to incorporate social and economic indicators in sustainability evaluations;
Develop approaches and select indicators that allow formalising connections between subsystems. Existing standard methods[2] should be used in this project for assessing environmental impacts. As regards, social life cycle assessment it is suggested to build on the work done by the Life Cycle Initiative[3];
Develop a quantitative approach that allows assessment of the sustainability multi-criteria trade-offs of circularity (cradle to cradle) dynamically in real cases. The approach needs to facilitate the incorporation of existing product LCSA harmonised approaches;
Develop a public demonstration of the LCSA approach, which can contribute towards effective uptake of LCSA within different sectors;

Reuse and recycling of many secondary raw materials continues to be low in the EU, while landfill and incineration rates remain high. The uptake and recyclability of secondary raw materials can be hampered by the presence of undesirable contaminants, additives and even substances of concern. The removal of such undesirable substances could improve the purity of the resulting secondary raw material and mitigate potential health and environmental concerns. In addition, the removal of these substances could increase the range of potential recycling and reuse applications for the secondary raw materials.
Scope:
Actions should develop innovative solutions for removing undesirable substances from secondary raw materials. The substances in question could be those posing health or environmental risks and/or those whose presence could adversely affect the quality of the secondary raw material. The safe utilisation or disposal of substances thus removed should be addressed as well. Proposals are expected to provide evidence of the potential market impact that the proposed solutions could bring, including quantitative information on the size of the targeted market. The economic feasibility and overall environmental performance of the proposed solution should also be considered. The work should also produce recommendations on the design and manufacturing of materials for recyclability and for standardisation.

Given resource constrains, lengthening the lifetime of products can play a major role in moving towards a circular economy. However, products may be designed in a way that adversely affects their lifetime or prevents upgradability. Identification of the factors that cause such premature obsolescence is also important because making products more durable and easier to repair, upgrade or remanufacture can represent a key factor of competitiveness. A longer lifetime for products has the potential to generate new economic activities and offer societal and environmental benefits, while at the same time spurring on innovation in existing business models. An action under Horizon 2020 to prepare an independent testing programme addressing product durability is included in the EU Action Plan for the Circular Economy[1].
Scope:
The objective is to prepare an independent testing programme to help identify issues related to premature obsolescence. The programme could be used by relevant stakeholders, such as, for instance, testing bodies, consumer organisations or product designers. It should focus on a group of consumer products for which the issue of obsolescence, including aspects such as the possibility of repair, upgrade and reuse, is important from the resource efficiency point of view. The methodology used to select this group of products should be convincingly explained. Where the issue of product durability encompasses interoperability and software support aspects, these should be addressed as well; however, the lifetime of software should not be the sole focus of the actions. A research component should be included to identify key aspects to be tested and to validate the testing programme in several case studies. An arrangement should be made that would enable inputs (e.g. examples of premature obsolescence or of testing methods) from a variety of stakeholders throughout the course of the project. Possible implications for standardisation should be addressed. The actions should be tackled by a multi-disciplinary consortium, including representatives of relevant stakeholders such as researchers, consumer organisations, testing bodies, manufacturers and repair service providers. Participation of representatives from the retail sector is encouraged.

","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Authorities throughout the EU continue to fund research and innovation in the field of circular economy at a national or regional level. Programme owners do so on the basis of their own mandates, though doubtlessly to a large extent in accordance with national and European priorities. Nevertheless, fragmentation of scarce resources, difficulties in implementing international synergies without a joint platform and lack of institutionalized outreach throughout Europe all hamper progress towards achieving common EU objectives. Moreover, the progress made in research and innovation underpinning circular economy varies throughout the EU.
This calls for a strategic approach to the coordination of objectives and programming of the regional, national and European funding programmes throughout the area of research and innovation for a circular economy. A strategic approach would help build international synergies among programme owners (in order to overcome and avoid fragmentation), and strengthen dissemination of lessons learned and new solutions for the circular economy resulting from currently isolated national programmes and funding.
Scope:
The action should establish a joint platform which will formulate, based on a thorough understanding of the state-of-the-art, the research and innovation needs and priorities for circular economy development in the EU. To this end, this action should bring together national and regional programme owners which will adequately represent the diversity of conditions and approaches from around the EU. The action should encompass joint development of objectives, priority setting, impact assessment, and programme and project organisation. It should produce a Strategic Research and Innovation Agenda, summarising recommendations for research priorities and coordinated programming and funding mechanisms. Innovation involving SMEs should be explicitly addressed. The action should disseminate best practices and promote multinational research and innovation actions within national and regional programmes. It should also include a mechanism whereby it could draw from the expertise and experience of leading research organisations as well as industry and civil society organisations. It should seek cooperation and synergies with relevant initiatives addressing the circular economy, including those funded by the EU.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of up to EUR 2 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
The project results are expected to contribute to:
alignment and coordination of regional, national and European programming of R&I in the area of the circular economy and associated environmental impacts;
effective regional, national and European R&I funding in the field of the circular economy, with special attention to SMEs;
accelerated diffusion of state-of-the-art circular economy solutions and best practices in circular economy R&I throughout Europe;
implementation of national and EU-level action plans including the Circular Economy Action Plan[1], the Green Action Plan for SMEs[2], and Eco-Innovation Action Plan[3].

","Research and Innovation action
","07 November 2017
","04 September 2018","Specific Challenge:
Securing the sustainable access to raw materials, including metals, industrial minerals and construction raw materials, and particularly Critical Raw Materials (CRM), is of high importance for the EU economy. There is a need for innovative and sustainable raw materials production solutions at lower TRLs to increase the range and quality of raw materials recovered from primary and secondary resources.
This specific challenge is identified in the Priority Area 'Technologies for primary and secondary raw materials production' of the European Innovation Partnership (EIP) on Raw Materials.
Scope:
Actions should develop sustainable systemic solutions through industrially- and user-driven multidisciplinary consortia covering the relevant value chain of non-energy, non-agricultural raw materials.
Actions should develop sustainable solutions finishing at the level of Technology Readiness Levels (TRL) 3-5.
Actions should evaluate the potential by-products[1] existing in primary or secondary raw materials and should develop energy-, material- and cost-efficient new sustainable mineral processing and/or metallurgical technologies and processes to increase the selectivity and the recovery rates of valuable by-products, particularly critical raw materials. The importance of the targeted sources of by-products for the EU economy should be duly demonstrated in the proposal. Recycling of end-of-life products is excluded from this topic.
All actions should contribute to achieving the objectives of the EIP on Raw Materials and to building the EU knowledge base of primary and secondary raw materials by feeding into the EC Raw Materials Information System – RMIS[2]. Actions should also contribute to improving the awareness of relevant external stakeholders and the general public across the EU about the importance of raw materials for society, the challenges related to their supply within the EU and about proposed solutions which could help to improve society's acceptance of and trust in sustainable raw materials production in the EU.
Actions should include a task to cluster with other projects financed under this topic and – if possible – with other relevant projects in the field funded by Horizon 2020, in support of the EIP on Raw Materials.
In line with the strategy for EU international cooperation in research and innovation (COM(2012)497), international cooperation is encouraged.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 3 million and EUR 7 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
The project results are expected to contribute to:
pushing the EU to the forefront in the area of raw materials processing technologies and solutions through generated know-how (planned patents, publications in high impact journals and joint public-private publications etc.);
significantly increased process selectivity, broader range and higher recovery rates of valuable raw materials, particularly critical raw materials, thereby unlocking substantial reserves of new or currently unexploited/underexploited resources within the EU;
significantly increased economic performance in terms of higher material-, water-, energy- and cost-efficiency and flexibility in minerals processing, metallurgical or recycling processes;
in the longer term, improving the competitiveness of and creating added value and new jobs in raw materials processing, refining, equipment manufacturing and downstream industries;
improving significantly the health, safety and environmental performance of the operations throughout the whole life cycle which is considered, including a reduction in waste, wastewater and emissions generation and a better recovery of resources from generated waste.

","04 September 2019","Specific Challenge:
Securing the sustainable access to raw materials, including metals, industrial minerals, wood- and rubber-based, construction and forest-based raw materials, and particularly Critical Raw Materials (CRM), is of high importance for the EU economy. Complex primary and secondary resources contain many different raw materials. Their processing, reuse, recycling and recovery schemes are complex and imply different steps, ranging from collection, logistics, sorting and separation to cleaning, refining and purification of materials.
The challenge for industry is to scale up promising raw materials production technologies and to demonstrate that raw materials can be produced in an innovative and sustainable way in order to make sure that research and innovation end up on the market, to strengthen the competitiveness of the European raw materials industries, meet ambitious energy and climate targets for 2030, minimise environmental impacts and risks, and gain the trust of EU citizens in the raw materials sector.
This specific challenge addresses the development of ""innovative pilot actions""[1], which is one of the major targets of the European Innovation Partnership (EIP) on Raw Materials.
Scope:
Actions should develop and demonstrate innovative pilots for the clean and sustainable production of non-energy, non-agricultural raw materials in the EU from primary and/or secondary sources finishing at Technology Readiness Levels (TRL) 6-7.
All actions should contribute to achieving the targets of the EIP on Raw Materials, particularly in terms of innovative pilot actions on processing and/or recycling for the innovative production of raw materials, and to building the EU knowledge base of primary and secondary raw materials by feeding into the EC Raw Materials Information System – RMIS[2]. Actions should also contribute to improving the awareness of relevant external stakeholders and the general public across the EU about the importance of raw materials for society, the challenges related to their supply within the EU and about proposed solutions which could help to improve society's acceptance of and trust in sustainable raw materials production in the EU.
All actions should facilitate the market uptake of solutions developed through industrially- and user-driven multidisciplinary consortia covering the relevant value chain and should consider standardisation aspects when relevant.
All actions should justify the relevance of selected pilot demonstrations in different locations within the EU (and also outside if there is a clear added value for the EU economy, industry and society).
All actions should include an outline of the initial exploitation and business plans (with indicated CAPEX, OPEX, IRR and NPV[3]) with clarified management of intellectual property rights, and commitment to the first exploitation.
In support of the EIP on Raw Materials actions should envisage clustering activities with other relevant selected projects for cross-projects co-operation, consultations and joint activities on cross-cutting issues and share of results as well as participating in joint meetings and communication events. To this end proposals should foresee a dedicated work package and/or task, and earmark the appropriate resources accordingly.
In line with the strategy for EU international cooperation in research and innovation (COM(2012)497), international cooperation is encouraged.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 8 million and EUR 13 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Applying a circular economy approach throughout the entire value chain, actions for this multi-annual topic should address only one of the following sub-topics:
a) Sustainable processing and refining of primary and/or secondary raw materials (2018, 2019): Actions should demonstrate new or improved systems integrating relevant processing and refining technologies for better recovery of minerals and metals at increased efficiency in terms of better yield and process selectivity as well as better utilisation of resources (hence reducing wastes). This would include processing of and recovery from low grade and/or complex ores and/or from industrial or mining wastes, and/or the reduction of the content of toxic elements or compounds in the resulting materials. The importance of the targeted raw materials and their sources for the EU should be demonstrated in the proposal. The solution proposed should be flexible enough to adapt to different or variable ore/secondary raw material grades and should be supported by efficient and robust process control. Where relevant, any solution proposed for the reduction of the content of toxic elements or compounds in the resulting materials should also include the appropriate management of the hazardous substances removed. Recycling of end-of-life products is excluded from this option.
b) Recycling of raw materials from end-of-life products (2018, 2019): Actions should develop and demonstrate novel and environmentally sound solutions for a higher recycling and recovery of secondary raw materials from end-of-life products such as waste electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE), batteries, wood-based panels, multi-material paper packaging, end-of-life tyres, etc. These products can contain a multitude of minerals, metals, wood and wood-fibre, rubber, etc. (including critical raw materials and other technology metals).
c) Recycling of raw materials from buildings (2018, 2019): Actions should develop and demonstrate novel solutions for a high-value recovery of raw materials from buildings. Actions should also benchmark against a series of comparative case studies of construction and demolition waste (C&DW) management in deconstruction of buildings of representative size categories in countries with different types of end-of-life building stocks, showcasing the appropriate use of the following: the EU C&DW Management Protocol[4], pre-demolition audit, smart demolition practices, using appropriate technical equipment, and sorting/processing and quality management of waste fractions such as metals, aggregates, concrete, bricks, plasterboard, glass, polymers and plastics and wood.
d) Advanced sorting systems for high-performance recycling of complex end-of-life products (2018, 2019): Actions should develop and demonstrate innovative dismantling and sorting systems enabling functional recycling of critical raw materials, or other types of highly efficient recovery of metals, minerals or construction materials, from complex end-of-life products and scrap thereof. The advanced sorting systems should achieve very high throughput rates in order to allow their economically viable operation on the European market.
Expected Impact:
The project results are expected to contribute to:
pushing the EU to the forefront in the area of raw materials processing and/or recycling technologies and solutions through generated know-how (planned patents, publications in high impact journals and joint public-private publications etc.);
improving significantly the economic viability and market potential that will be gained through the pilot, leading to expanding the business across the EU after the project is finished, as well as creating added value and new jobs in raw materials producing, equipment manufacturing and/or downstream industries;
unlocking a significant volume of various primary/secondary raw materials currently unexploited/underexploited within the EU, hence improving their 'circularity' in the economy;
improving significantly the health, safety and environmental performance throughout the whole life cycle considered, including better energy and water efficiency, a reduction in waste generation and wastewater and a better recovery of resources from generated waste or a better recovery and recycling of resources from complex end-of-life products;
additionally, only for sub-topic b) 'Recycling of raw materials from end-of-life products', in the shorter term, increasing measurably the efficiency and effectiveness (range, yield, quality and selectivity of recovered materials) of the exploitation of complex and heterogeneous secondary raw materials deposits ('urban mines') when compared to the state of the art;
additionally, only for sub-topic c) 'Recycling of raw materials from buildings', lead to wider application of smart demolition techniques, C&DW processing, quality assurance practices, traceability and standardization for secondary raw materials in the construction sector, thus improving the material and value recovery rate.

improving significantly the economic viability and market potential that will be gained through the pilot, leading to expanding the business across the EU after the project is finished, as well as creating added value and new jobs in raw materials producing, equipment manufacturing and/or downstream industries;
unlocking a significant volume of various primary/secondary raw materials currently unexploited/underexploited within the EU, hence improving their 'circularity' in the economy and ultimately closing the material cycles for a circular economy;
improving significantly the health, safety and environmental performance throughout the whole life cycle considered, including better energy and water efficiency, a reduction in emissions of greenhouse gases and pollutants, a reduction in waste generation and wastewater and a better recovery of resources from generated waste or a better recovery and recycling of resources from complex end-of-life products;
additionally, only for sub-topic b) 'Recycling of raw materials from end-of-life products', in the shorter term, increasing measurably the efficiency and effectiveness (range, yield, quality and selectivity of recovered materials) of the exploitation of complex and heterogeneous secondary raw materials deposits ('urban mines') when compared to the state of the art;
additionally, only for sub-topic c) 'Recycling of raw materials from buildings and infrastructure', lead to wider application of smart demolition techniques, C&DW processing, quality assurance practices, traceability and standardization for secondary raw materials in the construction sector, thus improving the material and value recovery rate.

","Innovation action
","12 November 2019
","03 September 2020","Specific Challenge:
Innovation is an indispensable part of the systemic transition towards a circular economy. In the past, innovation in sectors like plastics, textiles and furniture, often took place in silos, optimising for a specific aspect of the product or material. While these innovations have delivered improvements in one domain, they often weakened value creation or retention in other steps in the value chain, mostly downstream. An example can be found in the plastic packaging area, as combining multiple layers of different materials into one packaging item could deliver benefits for food preservation or transportation, but hinder cost-effective recycling. Systemic innovation should create value for the innovator actor and for the system as a whole. However, this potential has been explored only to a limited extent only. Hence, there is a need for designing and piloting circular systems, including business models, products and materials, and covering the entire value chain in scope, to test and demonstrate systemic innovation towards a circular economy in practice. Due to their mostly take-make-dispose products and business models, the plastics, textiles and furniture industries offer a clear potential for the design and piloting of circular systems.
Scope:
The objective of this action is to develop and pilot systemic circular economy innovations in plastics, textiles and furniture sectors that take into account value retention throughout the lifecycle of the product or service. Proposals are expected to bring together all relevant actors from across the value chain – from design and production, down to collection, sorting and reuse/repair/recycling – to rethink how to address the user’s need through a circular economy lens. Proposals should explore, develop and pilot systemic innovations that take into account value retention throughout the lifecycle of the product or service. Such innovations could cover design of business models, products and materials, industrial symbiosis, assuming the interdependencies and connections to the overall system in which the product/service is offered, are considered and acted upon. For example, designing office furniture to be easily upgraded/repaired requires the availability of spare parts, or designing plastic packaging to be composted requires the collection and transportation to a composting facility. The sectors in scope are one of the following three: plastics, textiles and furniture. Proposals are expected to provide quantitative information on the size of the targeted market, how that would evolve as a result of the proposed solution. Environmental and other societal benefits should be assessed from a lifecycle perspective and quantified. Participation of stakeholders across the value chain (e.g. material/product producers, end-users, collection/sorting/recycling organisations, etc.) is considered important. Data and information exchange across the different actors should be deployed, tested and evaluated to ensure value retention throughout the life cycle. The aim of this is to avoid silos of information and obtain a better understanding of the mutual dependencies between the several actors in the system and the changes on all technical and behavioural levels required to fulfil the full potential of systemic innovation. Activities are expected to achieve TLR 6-7 by the end of the project.
This topic is in support of the European Strategy for Plastics in a Circular Economy. Selected projects under this topic as well as projects selected under other topics in H2020 supporting the Plastics Strategy are strongly encouraged to participate in joint activities as appropriate. These joint activities could take the form of clustering of projects, participation in workshops, common exploitation and dissemination etc. The proposals are expected to demonstrate support to common coordination and dissemination activities. Applicants should plan the necessary budget to cover those activities without the prerequisite to define concrete common actions at this stage.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU in the range of EUR 7-8 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
The project results are expected to contribute to:
effective use of both primary and secondary resources in Europe, reducing waste generation, environmental pollution and greenhouse gas emissions, through innovative systems;
first-hand insights on how to develop and support systemic innovation towards a circular economy, starting from selected sectors;
evidence to inform more systemic policy decisions to further facilitate the transition to an effective circular economy in selected sectors;

","Research and Innovation action
","12 November 2019
","03 September 2020","Specific Challenge:
To date, efforts to understand the sources, transport and distribution of plastic pollution have mainly focused on the marine environmental compartment. However, it is widely acknowledged that the majority of marine plastic litter originates from land-based sources and that plastic litter of all sizes is prevalent in all environmental compartments (freshwater, marine, terrestrial, biological and atmospheric). To develop long-term mitigation solutions, a thorough understanding of the main sources and transport mechanisms of plastics into and through the environment is needed. This needs to be combined with determination of the quantity and composition, an understanding of plastic degradation processes in different environmental compartments and an assessment of plastics impacts on key species and ecosystems. In order to better support the identification of exposed ecosystems and to help decision-makers in reducing exposures, a wider effort bringing together experiences from different disciplines, such as hydrology, oceanography, limnology, monitoring, modelling, chemistry, toxicology, and risk assessments, and from relevant stakeholders, is needed.
Scope:
The aim of this action is to gain a better understanding on the sources, transport, distribution and impact of plastic pollution. The main areas for research activities should include:
a) Sources of plastic pollution to different environmental compartments;
b) Transport and pathways of plastics into and through different environmental compartments;
c) Occurrence and distribution of plastic across all environmental compartments;
d) Accumulation, including in soil and the food chain;
e) Degradation mechanisms for different plastic materials under range of environmentally conditions;
f) Physical and chemical effects of plastic pollution on different biotic and abiotic environments.
This action should aim to determine of the main entry routes of plastics into the different environmental compartments (e.g. marine, surface and groundwaters, soils and air, as well as potential transfers between these compartments. Furthermore, it should investigate the fate and transport behaviour of plastics with the goal of improving our current understanding of exposure within biotic and abiotic compartments. This should include determination of the spatial distribution and variability of plastics from its sources into rivers, lakes, estuaries and coastal areas and the open oceans. The research should contribute to the identification of the entry pathways, transport and accumulation within the ecosystems, including the potential for actual accumulations in the food chain (beyond presence in digestive systems).
Proposals should address different ecosystems, geographical areas and spatial scales, including the main environmental media such as marine, surface and ground-water, soils, air and biota. This would require case studies in selected areas, across Europe considering the marine water column and the seabed as well as surface water and terrestrial ecosystems, and comparative data on the contribution of point and diffuse sources and transport pathways to the scale of plastic pollution. To enhance understanding of the processes that drive the transport and fate of plastics in different ecosystems and on different temporal-spatial scales, computational models validated with empirical data, that predict hotspots and sinks of plastics would be also needed. Proposals should also enhance the current understanding of plastic degradation in the environment, including the characterisation of leaching chemicals and plastic degradation products. When the degradation of plastics under environmental conditions cannot readily be predicted based on information available from material sciences, degradation experiments simulating realistic weathering of plastics will inform about the fragmenting process of plastic debris as well as the release of chemicals. Research could cover nano-, micro-, or macro-plastics.
Cooperation with existing national and EU funded activities, such as the JPI Oceans initiative, is encouraged.

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
To develop long-term solutions to reduce plastic pollution, a thorough understanding of the emission problem is important, including consistent monitoring and mapping of plastic litter. These activities are indeed necessary in order to enable a comprehensive inventory to be carried out to classify the occurrence, to identify pollution priorities and to determine changes in the occurrence by means of subsequent investigations. At present, there are no harmonised EU-wide methods for determining the composition and occurrence of plastics in various relevant environmental compartments (e.g. marine waters, marine sediments, freshwater, soil, air). A commonly accepted terminology is the prerequisite for data comparability, collaboration, meta-level analysis and assessment. Rather than continuing to have different organisations and bodies at international, European and Member State level proposing their own definitions, a coordinated approach needs to be promoted. With research on the scale of the problem rapidly evolving, a systematic collection of available data and a critical assessment is missing.
Scope:
The aim of this action is to develop a common European framework to harmonise procedures for plastics pollution monitoring and assessments. This action should do so by bringing together the main national research groups in the field of physicochemical analysis of plastics in the environment, covering nano-, micro- and macro-plastics, to present jointly designed process proposals for the determination of plastics in different environmental matrices. A critical mass of actors and increased synergies between all relevant research areas (e.g. marine, surface, groundwater, drinking and waste water, soil, air), industry, regulators, associations and relevant EU services and standardisation bodies will be a key element to address the challenge. It is expected that different sampling, extraction and analysis methods are evaluated for their suitability and feasibility (availability, cost-effectiveness, quality of data generated) for use within future monitoring activities.
This action should ensure adequate flexibility for taking into account all relevant aspects prior to formal standardisation procedures and provide:
a) harmonised methods for sampling, sample preparation and analytical detection of different kind of plastics in different environmental compartments and connected matrices, including realistic matrix reference materials;
b) methods for monitoring to enable a comprehensive inventory to be carried out to classify the occurrence, to identify emission and pollution priorities and to determine changes in the occurrence by means of subsequent investigations;
c) methods for identification and analysis of plastics in the environment;
d) proposals as a basis for international and European standards (ISO / CEN);
e) recommendations for future relevant EU policy and legislation;;
f) increased knowledge on the occurrence of plastics in the environment with respect to related questions, such as physical and chemical adverse effects on biota.
In addition, this action should deliver guidance on data management, including the need for relevant infrastructures, cooperation on sharing data, creation of joint databases and the promotion of meta-analysis of existing data. This action does not involve data collection. It should also inform future strategic programming for research and innovation for plastics by identifying knowledge gaps and needs.
This topic is in support of the European Strategy for Plastics in a Circular Economy.

","08 September 2020","Specific Challenge:
In many African regions, agriculture is predominantly subsistence-oriented, hence most farmers lack the means to invest on improving the productivity of their exploitation activities, or to undertake basic transformation of their produce. Low productivity and lack of economic diversification makes farmers vulnerable to food insecurity, and contribute to a continuous migration towards urban areas, especially among the younger generations.
In many locations, unsustainable practices generate serious impacts on the environment, such as deforestation for energy or for new agricultural land, or soil degradation, which further aggravate the vulnerability of rural populations.
Scope:
Proposals shall screen existing bio-based technologies that can be adapted and successfully transferred to rural African contexts. The focus should be on simple, robust technologies that can be operated and maintained locally, and suitable for operation at farm, village or rural community level (including mobile systems). A variety of end-products can be considered[1], and the business models developed should be sustainable and highly circular. Although bio-fuels or bio-energy can be part of the end-products, projects focussing mainly on these outputs are not eligible.
The selected technologies shall be integrated into one existing agri-food system[2] without compromising food production, and without fundamentally changing established agricultural practices, provided that these are sustainable. The integrated value chain should be widely replicable, based on agricultural by-products or dedicated crops that can be incorporated through multi-cropping or intercropping practices, including agro-forestry. It shall be tested and adapted in real productive conditions, in an appropriate number of testing sites. A thorough assessment shall be performed on the agronomic, environmental, social and economic sustainability of the whole model, including gender issues and an assessment of potential risks. The project shall deliver practice guides and policy recommendations for deployment in new areas.
Projects should ensure solid collaboration between farmers, farmers associations, local industry, technology providers, research centres, extension services and policy makers. Development partners and relevant international organisations should be involved as appropriate. Proposals should include a task to cluster with other relevant projects involved in the EU-Africa R&I Partnership on FNSSA and with the cooperation platform established under SFS-33-2018[3]. Activities should also be foreseen to cluster with the other projects financed under this topic.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of up to EUR 9 million would allow this specific scope to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude the submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
Proposed activities will deliver new and sustainable bio-based value chains that can be plugged into African agri-food systems. This will help rural communities to:
Increase and diversify agricultural income and foster savings and investment.
Enhance sustainability and reduce the environmental impact of domestic and economic activities, through e.g. reduced logging or nutrient recycling.
Develop new economic activities and sectors, thus creating new jobs and opportunities.
In the longer term results will contribute improving livelihoods, enhancing food security, increasing community resilience, and reducing rural migration.

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Public policies in China and in several EU Member States have promoted the use of anaerobic digestion to treat organic wastes and to generate renewable energy. This has resulted in the production of considerable volumes of digestate as by-product, which could raise an environmental concern, prove costly and represent an inefficient use of biomass. The most straight-forward option for placing a value on digestate is to use it as an organic fertiliser and soil amender. However digestate is not highly appreciated by farmers as a soil treatment due to its significant shortcomings. These may include, amongst other things and depending on the feedstock source, potential risks of water pollution through leaching, soil contamination, or a threat to human health by food contamination. Furthermore, digestate is difficult to manage due to its fertilising properties, format and high water content.
Scope:
Projects shall develop treatment technologies to convert digestate into a suitable fertiliser or soil amender. They could focus on a specific digestate type or develop a flexible process covering a variety of digestates. These treatments shall (i) reduce risks linked to biological and chemical hazards (including AMR) to acceptable levels, (ii) improve fertilising properties and (iii) address issues related to format, formulation and handling. Proper solutions must be sought for the liquid phase to avoid pollution.
The fertiliser developed must be suitable for direct use, or for mixed formulation with other fertilisers. Field tests must be implemented over an appropriate period of time to assess its agronomic properties, as well as its effect on the environment (including greenhouse gas emissions), and on food safety. Projects shall focus on technologies that could be deployed in a decentralised manner, at a relatively small scale. Such technologies shall achieve a technology readiness level (TRL) 6-7 by the end of your project. A comprehensive impact assessment (economic, environmental and social) of the business model shall be carried out, and policy recommendations shall be provided to boost its deployment.
Proposals shall ensure solid collaboration between agro-food actors, technology providers, research centres, end-users (farmers and farmers associations), and public administration. Projects shall perform a thorough analysis of the state of the art, and demonstrate that your proposed activities go beyond this state and do not overlap with past or ongoing research.
Proposals shall include a task to cluster with other projects financed under topic RUR CE-08-2018/2019/2020 and — if possible — with other relevant projects in the field funded by Horizon 2020, including under the Bio-based Industries Joint Undertaking (BBI JU). Proposals shall promote balanced research and innovation cooperation between the EU and China. China-based entities that will participate in joint projects with European partners under Horizon 2020 have also the possibility to apply for funding under the Chinese co-funding mechanism.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of up to EUR 5 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude the submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts. Contributions for Chinese participants will come in addition and will be made available by China.
Expected Impact:
Projects are expected to provide the technologies needed to develop commercial fertilisers based on biogas digestate. This will help to:
replace conventional, non-renewable mineral fertilisers, hence reducing external dependence and risks related to depletion;
reduce the environmental impacts linked to the inadequate management of biogas digestate, and to the production of fossil-based fertilisers;
develop new business models in rural areas, that are synergised with existing ones, creating value from digestate.
In the long term, this shall contribute to a more circular, resource-efficient and sustainable agro-food sector, and create wealth and quality jobs in rural areas.
Projects shall also contribute to increasing the innovation capacities of participating organisations, and to strengthening scientific and industrial collaboration between the EU and China.

","Innovation action
","03 July 2019
","03 September 2020","Specific Challenge:
The transition to a circular economy requires that the value in products is retained as long as possible. To achieve this, reliable information about the composition of components and materials is needed for health and safety in repair and recycling enterprises and for improved user integration in sustainable product design and in new business models.
Other aspects such as recyclability, dismantlability, recycled content, the sustainability of sourcing of raw materials, security of supply, and ultimately the overall environmental and social performance along the life cycle, are also related to the composition and design of products. If the downstream actors in the value chain, such as consumers, retailers or end-product manufacturers demand this information, it needs to be collected in the whole supply chain upstream. The implementation of resource efficiency benchmarks in products e.g. via Ecodesign or the EU Ecolabel also requires product composition and environmental performance data. The information needs of consumers are of course different from those of manufacturers and recyclers, and suppliers and manufacturers are traditionally worried about excessive transparency and possible violations of proprietary data rights. All this needs to be considered in the design of the information flow in the economic value chain.
Although some manufacturers and suppliers use specific software for internal communication, upstream aggregation and compliance documentation for sectoral product legislation, this does not cover the critical information needs with regard to circularity or the overall life cycle performance. Some SMEs, start-ups, and social and municipal enterprises outside the supply chain would benefit from access to such information management systems, but they have too limited resources to invest in complex and expensive software solutions.
There is thus a need for designing and piloting an information system for raw materials and components in products and their environmental performance that is linked to the material and value flows in an ideally circular system.
The design should be flexible and smart with regard to data volume and conversions and should include the whole flow for a specific business, from raw materials supply via components to the finished product, including customers, repair business, refurbishers, and recyclers.
In addition, the flexibility should allow actors to use the data for compliance reasons, such as REACH or the (future) ECHA database on the presence of hazardous chemicals in articles (ECHA, 2018). It should also allow aggregation and extrapolation with a view to the analysis and mapping of raw material flows and needs in Europe. The concept, the data flow and the specific needs of each actor should be studied in a pilot with operators that are interested in making their business sustainable and future-proof.
Scope:
Proposals are expected to bring together all relevant actors along product related value chains – product designers, producers, consumers, businesses providing repair or refurbishment, data provider and manager, sorters and recyclers. The selected products should have a major environmental impact, offer a high potential for circularity, have a complex supply chain, and be linked at both ends of the lifecycle to critical resource issues, e.g. the manufacturing industry, which includes amongst others textiles and plastics, construction and sectors with products that may contain critical raw materials. Where applicable, official nomenclature, such as used in Prodcom[1], should be used for all products and materials. Ideally, a fully functional system should be set up in a value chain with high internal quality standards and an established refurbishment business. The knowledge gained in this set-up should be comprehensive and systemic enough to be easily transferable to less complex sectors and business models. All information flows should be designed with a view to increased circularity, traceability and minimisation of the overall environmental footprint. Proposals should explore, develop and test integrated information flows that take into account the diverse information needs throughout and beyond the original lifecycle of the product.
To facilitate open innovation and transferability, open solutions such as open source software, open hardware design, and open access to data are encouraged. Results from the supported projects might play a central role in the further development of the policies for the transition to a circular economy. The ambition to grant open access to the underlying architecture such as databases, encryption and access rights management should therefore be a central element of the proposals, while adequately addressing possible data protection, user privacy and liability issues. Beneficiaries are encouraged to build value-added services based on the established architecture.
In order to facilitate project management, the development of respective technologies should be decentralised. Proposals are expected to provide quantitative information on the potential for transferring the implemented solution to the wider sector and to other relevant sectors. Based on the pilot data, environmental benefits should be assessed from a lifecycle perspective and quantified using the Product Environmental Footprint (PEF) method[2], which has already been elaborated for certain product categories in cooperation with industrial partners[3]. The social assessment part shall build on the work done in the context of the life cycle initiative and the Platform for Life Cycle Assessment[4]. Economic benefits should also be assessed and quantified under a life cycle perspective.
Participation of actors across the value chain, e.g. material and product producers, end-user organisations, civil society organisations, repair and recycling businesses, etc. is considered essential. Specific information needs at each point in the value chain should be addressed in a satisfactory way, systemised, and the respective data generated out of the integrated information flow. An additional aim of this testing is to obtain a better understanding of the mutual dependencies between the several operators in the system.
Clustering and cooperation with other selected projects under this cross-cutting call and other relevant projects is strongly encouraged.
Activities are expected to focus on Technology Readiness Levels (TRLs) 5-7.

Objectives
The aim is to provide support for a small group of two to four Principal Investigators to jointly address ambitious research problems that could not be addressed by the individual Principal Investigators and their teams working alone. Synergy projects should enable substantial advances at the frontiers of knowledge, stemming, for example, from the cross-fertilization of scientific fields, from new productive lines of enquiry, or new methods and techniques, including unconventional approaches and investigations at the interface between established disciplines. The transformative research funded by Synergy Grants should have the potential of becoming a benchmark on a global scale.
Principal Investigators must demonstrate the ground-breaking nature, ambition and feasibility of their scientific proposal. Principal Investigators must also demonstrate that their group can successfully bring together the scientific elements necessary to address the scope and complexity of the proposed research question.
One of the Principal Investigators must be designated as the Corresponding Principal Investigator. At any one time, one Principal Investigator per Synergy Grant Group except the Corresponding one can be hosted or engaged by an institution outside of the EU or Associated Countries.
Size of ERC Synergy Grants
Synergy Grants may be awarded up to a maximum of EUR 10 000 000 for a period of 6 years. The maximum award is reduced pro rata temporis for projects of a shorter duration. This does not apply to ongoing projects.
However, up to an additional EUR 4 000 000 in total can be requested in the proposal to cover (a) eligible ‘start-up’ costs for Principal Investigators moving to the EU or an Associated Country from elsewhere as a consequence of receiving the ERC grant and/or (b) the purchase of major equipment and/or (c) access to large facilities and/or (d) other major experimental and field work costs, excluding personnel costs. As any additional funding is to cover major one-off costs it is not subject to pro rata temporis reduction for projects of shorter duration. All funding requested is assessed during evaluation.
Profile of the ERC Synergy Grant Principal Investigators
The 'Synergy Grant Group' applying for the ERC Synergy Grant must be made up of a minimum of two and a maximum of four Principal Investigators with competitive track records and, as necessary, their teams.
Each Principal Investigator must present as part of the proposal either an early achievement track-record or a 10-year track-record, whichever is most appropriate for their career stage (see Starting, Consolidator and Advanced Grant profiles in the ERC Work Programme 2022). There is little prospect of an application succeeding in the absence of such a record.

","07 November 2017
","04 September 2018","Specific Challenge:
Better understanding of the key processes controlling the climate-Earth system is fundamental in order to further improve climate projections, reduce uncertainty in climate sensitivity calculations, enhance understanding of frequency and strength of extreme weather events, and assess more accurately the impacts of climate change related to the proximity, rate, reversibility and tipping points of abrupt climate change, and the identification of safe operating spaces. Furthermore, future climate scenarios strongly benefit from the combined use of models and paleo-reconstructions conducted in Polar Regions as they allow a better understanding of how the climate system worked, both regionally and globally, during abrupt climatic transitions and under warmer or colder than present day conditions.
Scope:
Actions should address only one of the following sub-topics:
a) Improving the understanding of key climate processes for reducing uncertainty in climate projections and predictions: Actions should achieve better understanding of key processes, and associated feedbacks, affecting the climate-Earth system over time, in order to improve climate projections and predictions and constrain climate sensitivity estimates. Actions may cover processes such as cloud and aerosol dynamics and cloud-aerosol interactions, biogeochemical cycles and their evolution under a changing climate, ocean dynamics and circulation, dynamic interactions between atmosphere, land, ocean and ice (both sea ice and land ice), troposphere-stratosphere coupling, external forcing and other relevant processes.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 6 million and EUR 8 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
b) Tipping points: Actions should result in better understanding of abrupt climate change, of climate-related Earth system tipping elements and their tipping points, and associated impacts. Actions should identify safe operating spaces, accompanied – where relevant – with long-term strategies for preventing or mitigating impacts. Actions should also advance the understanding of respective impacts and early warning indicators.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 6 million and EUR 8 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
c) Ice-core drilling in East Antarctica: Actions should build on the outcomes of the Horizon 2020 project 'Beyond EPICA' (http://www.beyondepica.eu), and contribute to the European endeavour which aims to obtain a 1.5 million year old ice-core from East Antarctica. This will allow to better constrain the climate response to future GHG emissions and to unravel key linkages between the carbon cycle, ice sheets, the oceans and the atmosphere.
In line with the strategy for EU international cooperation in research and innovation (COM(2012)497), international cooperation is encouraged.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU in the range of EUR 10 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
The project results are expected to contribute to:
supporting major international scientific assessments such as the IPCC;
increase confidence in climate change projections;
providing added-value to decision and policy makers;

","03 September 2020","Specific Challenge:
In order to gain more insight in the fast rate of climate, ecological and environmental change taking place in the Arctic and to facilitate well-informed decisions, there is a need to develop coordinated Earth observations and information services specifically targeting this region, also building on the essential contribution of indigenous knowledge and community-based monitoring systems. These observations and services need to be delivered in order to support a sustainable development in the Arctic, particularly for responding to the needs of the people who live there. Observations and services are also necessary to improve the monitoring and predicting capabilities on changes that may affect other parts of the planet, and in particular the Northern hemisphere. The challenge and suitable actions to alleviate adverse consequences were identified in the 2nd Arctic Science Ministerial Joint Statement of Ministers.[1]
Scope:
The action should aim at: (i) advancing the operationalisation of an integrated pan-Arctic Observing System in preparation for a possible future ArcticGEOSS initiative; (ii) improving and extending the terrestrial, marine and cryospheric in-situ measurements and the community-based monitoring systems necessary for the monitoring of the Arctic; (iii) setting up pilot services and implementing the coordinated network of those services necessary for the adaptation to climate change in the region; (iv) contributing to the interoperability of Arctic Data systems; and (v) to make a positive contribution to national, regional and international decision-making processes and science strategies.
The action should help to build an Arctic “window”[2] of Copernicus by bringing together all Arctic relevant observations deriving from different Copernicus services and promoting access to relevant Copernicus datasets.
The action should coordinate with projects stemming from the NSFs Arctic portfolio, such as the ""Navigating the New Arctic"" programme, and other actions of the Transatlantic Ocean Research Alliance, by establishing joint operational activities, in order to support the mission and objectives of the international initiative on Arctic observations brought forward by the Sustaining Arctic Observing Networks (SAON).
In line with the strategy for EU international cooperation in research and innovation (COM(2012)497), international cooperation is encouraged, in particular with the countries and Indigenous Peoples organisations participating in the 2nd Arctic Science Ministerial[3].
The action should build on the outcomes of previous EU-funded projects in the framework of GEO and Copernicus, create synergies and avoiding un-necessary duplications also by joining the EU Arctic Research Cluster. Likewise, the action should cooperate with relevant projects funded by the ESA Earth Observation Programme. To this end, proposals should foresee a dedicated work package and /or task and earmark the appropriate resources accordingly.
The pilot services should fall into the scope of EuroGEOSS and follow the direction of the EuroGEOSS initiative. Data and services produced through the projects should be registered in the GEOSS Common Infrastructure (GCI).
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU in the range of EUR 15 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
The project results are expected to contribute to:
the implementations the GEO-Cold Region Initiative with a specific emphasis on the Arctic, and the initiating of an ArcticGEOSS initiative;
sound and effective decision-making by policy makers in the Arctic regions through the use of reliable and science-based Earth observation and information;
supporting of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, the Paris Agreement and Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015-2030;
strengthening Earth observation capacity focused on the European region;
delivering EuroGEOSS services for the Arctic;
improved handling, archiving and interoperability of environmental data in polar regions;

","12 November 2019
","03 September 2020","Specific Challenge:
Risks due to natural hazards have increased dramatically in Europe, due to deep changes in climate, land use and socio-economic evolution since the 20th century. Improved disaster risk management and reduction requires an integrated approach to better forecast, prevent and adapt to multiple hazards, their interactions and impacts. Innovative and comprehensive methodologies, models and tools that assess multi-hazard risks and associated cascading effects and take due account of future drivers (such as climate change), have the potential to represent the leverage to help risk managers and decision-makers prioritise mitigation/adaptation actions, resilient preparedness and response, and develop sustainable and resilient development pathways.
Scope:
Actions are encouraged to capitalise on and assess existing methodologies, models and tools for disaster risk management available at EU and national levels in order to define a common framework for risk and vulnerability assessments for areas exposed to multiple natural hazards. Based on the diagnosis of multi-hazards and multi-risk assessments, innovative decision-making tools that help planners to make effective and future proofed risk management choices need to be developed (e.g., dynamic adaptation pathways to address future and emerging threats). Sustainable adaptation options including ecosystem-based approaches such as Nature-Based Solutions – that are cost-effective and provide multiple co-benefits should be prioritised where appropriate.
Research actions should aim to develop a harmonized and standardised multi-hazard risk management approach in order to compare the threats and combined effects posed by several natural hazards (geological, hydrological, meteorological and biological), including hazards from compounded events, and evaluate the risks related to their interactions and cascade/simultaneous effects on the socio-ecological systems. A forward looking perspective, paying due attention to future trends and drivers (such as climate change) should be ensured. In this perspective, quantitative scenarios on present and future risks, on potential direct and indirect effects, in a multi risk environment need further developments. In order to be more operational, such a framework should be developed in close cooperation and dialogue between science and practice with the key actors and end-users to take into account their needs in the scientific development of multi hazard/multi risk assessment methods and enable feasible solutions for more practical use.
In light of the above, actions should also seek to develop mapping tools and user-friendly ICT open interfaces to better understand the model scenarios and outputs. Emphasis on systemic vulnerability of different sectors exposed to multi-hazard risk (e.g. agriculture, forests and other economic sectors, land use, infrastructure, ecosystems) will require particular attention in building the risk analysis. Similarly, uncertainty should be more consistently addressed to provide reliable estimates of vulnerability and risks. Action should take advantage of data and information provided by the Copernicus programme, in particular the Copernicus Emergency Service, and the European Research Infrastructure Consortiums (ERIC) such as the European Plate Observing System (EPOS) and the European Multidisciplinary Seafloor and Water Column Observatory (EMSO). Actions should also build upon and seek collaboration with the projects funded under the relevant SC7 DRS topics.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU in the range of EUR 3-5 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
The project results are expected to contribute to:
a consensus in better definitions, indicators and functions to characterise multi-hazard risk through enhanced inter-disciplinary collaboration between the different science and practice communities addressing various types of hazards, disaster risk and sustainable development;
prioritisation of investments and pertinent selection of effective risk reduction management options;
enhanced capacity for identification of vulnerable, threatened areas and infrastructures most at risk from multi hazards in Europe;
better informed forward-looking national risk assessments that also take into account long-term drivers such as climate change, and enhanced implementation of existing legislation and streamlining of policies;
enhanced risk-informed decisions on land-use planning addressing trade-offs between differing prioritized adaptation options and competing policy goals;
enhanced understanding of the relationships and interactions of multiple hazard, including compound events and cascading risks and risk related processes driven by environmental and societal changes on different time and spatial scales;
better knowledge exchange through platforms such as Disaster Risk Management Knowledge Centre, and stakeholder networks on emergent risks and extreme events (e.g., Community of Users, Risk Knowledge-Action Network)."

","04 September 2019","Specific Challenge:
Most low-carbon pathways leading to well below 2°C (or 1.5°C) stabilisation of the global temperature – in line with the Paris Agreement goals – include negative emissions to compensate for residual emissions and/or temperature overshoot and highlight the critical role of land-use based mitigation. There is therefore a need to quantitatively assess the potential, effectiveness and impacts of negative emission technologies/practices and of land-use mitigation options, in achieving the long-term goals of the Paris Agreement, as well as linking these to what it would mean for concrete policy challenges.
Scope:
Actions should address only one of the following sub-topics:
a) Feasibility of negative emissions for climate stabilisation: Actions should assess the potential, effectiveness, efficiency, risks and costs of existing and emerging negative emission technologies and practices for climate stabilisation and their impact on: land, subsurface, water, oceans and other resources, bio-diversity, human safety, food security, ecosystems and their ability to deliver services to society, including implications for resilience, sustainability, feedbacks on climate and the global carbon cycle, and other relevant issues. Actions should also cover the issue of public acceptance and explore the international governance requirements associated with large-scale deployment of negative emission technologies and practices.
b) Land-based mitigation: Actions should provide a comprehensive analysis of various land-use based mitigation options at the global and regional level, assessing their potential and effectiveness in providing large-scale reductions of greenhouse gases, in the context of trade-offs and/or co-benefits in relation to other pressures and goals (e.g. food, energy and water security, biodiversity, air quality) and should analyse feedbacks between land-use based mitigation and climate change impacts. Actions should also improve current methodologies to estimate emissions and removals associated with land use measures, also by leveraging observations from GEOSS and in particular the Copernicus programme.
For both of the sub-topics, in line with the strategy for EU international cooperation in research and innovation (COM(2012)497), international cooperation is encouraged.
Actions should envisage clustering activities with other relevant selected projects for cross-projects co-operation, consultations and joint activities on cross-cutting issues and share of results as well as participating in joint meetings and communication events. To this end, proposals should foresee a dedicated work package and/or task, and earmark the appropriate resources accordingly.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 5 million and EUR 7 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
The project results are expected to contribute to:
major international scientific assessments such as the IPCC reports and the IPBES, as well as to national and EU impact assessments of possible mitigation options;
developing a comprehensive medium-to-long term vision and analytical framework on pathways to achieve climate neutrality[1] in the perspective of reaching the PA goals;
improved ex-post, spatially explicit monitoring of the mitigation performance of the land sector;
enhanced international cooperation.

","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Climate change is predicted to pose the greatest long-term threat to biodiversity in many regions. It is affecting the habitats of many species, which must either adapt or migrate to areas with more favourable conditions. Biodiversity changes can have knock-on effects upon a range of ecosystem functions and services, including food and biomass production and capacity to mitigate and adapt to climate change. Feedback processes may amplify or diminish the effect of climate forcing, and so play an important part in determining the climate sensitivity to human activities and the future climate state.
Addressing the impact of climate change requires the mobilisation of all relevant actors: academia, research institutes, public authorities at various levels, manufacturing industry and business at large, finance and insurance, non-governmental organisations and civil society. A properly aligned European Research Area, which is also open to the world, can make an essential difference in enabling a transformative, climate-resilient sustainability agenda to take shape. The alignment of research and innovation agendas is therefore crucial in bringing about the necessary transformations.
Scope:
The Cofund action should examine: the impact of climate change on all levels of biodiversity, ecosystem functioning and ecosystem services; feedback processes; the potential of nature-based solutions for enhancing climate change adaptation, mitigation, including negative emissions; and synergies and trade-offs between different policies, including those on biodiversity, climate action and air quality. The action should capitalize on major strands of knowledge and on the results of relevant projects funded under past EU Framework Programmes. The Cofund action will target all types of terrestrial, freshwater and marine environments, which may also include the impact of climate change on biodiversity and ecosystem functioning and services in agricultural areas and taking agricultural and forestry policies into account.
The Cofund action should be implemented through close cooperation between the Member States and Associated Countries grouped around the BiodivERsA network and in collaboration with the FACCE JPI. The Cofund action should envisage clustering activities with other relevant selected projects for cross-projects co-operation, consultations and joint activities on cross-cutting issues and share of results as well as participating in joint meetings and communication events. To this end, proposals should foresee a dedicated work package and/or task, and earmark the appropriate resources accordingly. The Cofund action should also take into account data and information from the Copernicus programme, as the European Union's Earth Observation Programme.
Proposals should pool the necessary financial resources from the participating national (or regional) research programmes with a view to implementing a joint call for proposals resulting in grants to third parties with EU co-funding in this area. Proposers are requested to include at least one additional joint call without EU co-funding as well as other activities such as the establishment or consolidation of a pan-European network of funding agencies and other key players in Europe, building on previous experience and avoiding overlaps with existing initiatives, support to mutual learning and training, exchange of good practice, researcher mobility and equal opportunities (e.g. through EURAXESS) and better careers in the field. Wherever relevant, actions should involve social sciences and humanities.
Participation of legal entities from third countries, and/or regions including those not automatically eligible for funding in accordance with General Annex A, is encouraged in the joint call as well as in other joint activities including additional joint calls without EU co-funding. Participants from countries not listed in General Annex A are eligible for EU funding under this topic and may request a Union contribution (on the basis of the ERA-NET unit cost) only for the coordination costs of additional activities. The proposal should demonstrate that these co-funded other activities exclude any overlaps with related on-going actions co-funded by the EU under Horizon 2020.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU in the range of EUR 5 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
The project results are expected to contribute to:
effective trans-national, pan-European research networking and synergies among national/regional and EU research programmes in the areas addressed;
improved evidence-based policy through the interdisciplinary and trans-disciplinary science-policy interface and links with international efforts and fora on the areas addressed;
underpinning the EU Nature Directives, EU Water and Marine Strategy Framework Directive, EU Biodiversity Strategy, 7th Environment Action Programme, and the EU Strategy on adaptation to climate change;
informing major international scientific assessments such as the Intergovernmental science-policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) reports and contributing to the goals of the Paris Agreement;

","03 September 2020","Specific Challenge:
Timely and reliable Earth observation data and information on the state of our changing climate and environment are indispensable to support the EU in its international commitment on climate change. In particular, the Paris Agreement accentuates the need for new, transparent, integrated solutions to better understand the Earth system, minimise and address climate change contributors and impacts, support accountability towards long-term goals and inform climate services and decision making. Developing integrated solutions tailored to needs in Europe will depend on the European capability to combine multiple Earth observation (EO) data sets - including GEOSS and Copernicus data sets - with ensemble modelling, socio-economic and in-situ data at the spatial and temporal scales at which interactions in the land, marine and atmosphere ecosystems operate.
Scope:
Actions should focus on developing applications in support of users involved in the implementation of climate adaptation and mitigation actions in line with the Paris Agreement, by integrating a whole range of Earth Observation data including those recorded through in-situ observing systems, and Essential Climate Variables (ECVs). The actions will seek to use higher spatial and/or temporal data sets while also taking advantage of a broader open data access and new data mining technologies. In addition, the actions should advance methodologies for integrating resulting data flows with multiple GEOSS data sets (from EO satellites to in-situ data including citizen data where appropriate), numerical model outputs and other relevant statistical and socio-economic data. Ultimately, integrated applications should concentrate on climate adaptation applications with estimated societal impact, on impact of GHG emissions or related indicators (such as land cover changes), or feed new indicators for the monitoring of progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in an EU context. Special attention should be given to multi-scale approaches with abilities to scale up and down from European to local scales.
The actions should make use of, contribute to and feedback on the GEOSS platform which provides international user communities with tools for discovery, visualisation and access to GEOSS data. The actions should actively contribute to relevant GEO Tasks of the GEO Work Programme. It should contribute to the development of user-driven climate applications to be delivered through the EuroGEOSS initiative. They should promote open science and underpin the work of the IPCC through the enlarged provision of in-situ data and of further analyses of ECVs. Applications resulting from the actions should complement relevant Copernicus core services (e.g. Climate Change Service - C3S, Land Monitoring, etc.) and address well identified end user needs in Europe. When relevant, actions should align with the European Space Agency (ESA) programmes[1].
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU in the range of EUR 4-5 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
The project results are expected to contribute to:
the direct support of the adaptation and mitigation measures of the Paris Agreement, as well as the other GEO engagement priorities such as the Agenda for Sustainable Development, and the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015-2030;
the European input to the GEO Work Programme post-2019 to address the climate change challenge cross-cutting all GEO Societal Benefit Areas (SBA) (e.g. for improved land use management);
increasing European capability to combine multiple EO data sets with models, socio-economic and in-situ data, based on a systematic exploitation of the GEOSS Platform ;
reinforcing in-situ component of European observing systems for the monitoring of internationally recognised Essential Climate Variables (ECVs);
the new EuroGEOSS pilot applications to better understand climate change contributors and impacts, and minimise the degradation of the Earth system, support accountability towards long-term goals and inform climate services and decision making.

Earth System Models (ESMs) are essential tools for supporting climate policy-making and the Paris Agreement implementation. Ensembles of scenario-based runs are widely used for designing and evaluating mitigation pathways and goals. However, notwithstanding the increase in their performance, ESMs still have several areas of improvement around predicting capability, process realism, capacity of resolving epistemic uncertainty, needs of parametrisation, reduction in systematic biases, time and resolution. Following-up a long-lasting tradition of various EU Framework Programmes to provide substantial support for ESM development, it is time to re-launch the challenge to address the competing demands around the development of ESMs.
Scope:
Actions should address in a novel way one or more of the competing demands that surround the advancement of ESMs (e.g., improved process realism, large ensemble of predictions, improved model resolution, etc.). Actions should aim to develop innovative and effective approaches that add to or better represent Earth system processes linked to climate change. Actions should further explore novel ways of coupling existing models (e.g., ice-sheet dynamics) with ESMs and where appropriate, improve synergies with reduced complexity carbon-cycle, atmospheric composition and climate models. Actions are encouraged to explore linkages with relevant integrated assessment models. Actions may also devise new data assimilation methods that will demonstrably improve ESMs.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU in the range of EUR 10-12 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.

","03 September 2020","Specific Challenge:
Under the Paris Agreement it was agreed to enhance adaptive capacity, strengthening resilience and reducing vulnerability to climate change, with a view to contributing to sustainable development and ensuring an adequate adaptation response. It was also recognised that there is a need to enhance action on adaptation with regard to strengthening scientific knowledge on climate, including research, systematic observation of the climate system and early warning systems, in a manner that informs climate services and supports decision-making, including the socio-economic analysis of adaptation options for key impact areas. Recent advances have led to the creation of very large amounts of climate data. It is important that we are able to use said data (in particular data provided by the Copernicus programme) and create services that communicate and deliver bespoke critical climate information to better inform risk-aware decision making and adaptation strategies.
Scope:
The proposed action should address only one of the following sub-topics:
a) Mapping European coastal infrastructure at risk from sea-level rise:
Actions should undertake a new high-resolution mapping of predictions of future sea levels against European coastal elevation and identify risks to relevant coastal infrastructure. Actions should deliver an engaging, interactive and authoritative map of the European coastal zone perceived to be at risk of inundation due to future predicted changes in relative sea levels. Actions should also include low-probability high-impact scenarios and account for local, regional and global processes driving changes in coastal elevation. Actions may further consider the impact of adaptation measures (e.g. barriers) that are already in place and projected impacts on population displacements. Cooperation with projects under topic LC-CLA-13-2020 and other relevant on-going Horizon 2020 projects is encouraged.
b) Detection and attribution of extreme events using Artificial Intelligence:
Actions should explore novel approaches for detection and localisation of extreme events, including tropical cyclones and heat waves, and for quantifying extreme events trends in current day and future climate change scenarios. Actions should develop artificial intelligence techniques (e.g., deep learning) to detect spatial and temporal patterns and evolutions of climatological fields (e.g., temperature) associated with extreme events. These techniques should be capable of discriminating between different variables based on the event type and capable of handling events at various spatial scales. Particular consideration should also be given to associated impacts and attribution to climate change. Where appropriate, actions should take advantage of data provided by the Copernicus programme.
c) Impacts of overshooting:
Understanding how rising global temperature translates to impacts for society and natural ecosystems is critical in order to prepare for, and strive to reduce, the magnitude of climate change. While global temperature is a good indicator of global change, local impacts can be much more pronounced. Actions should assess and report on the impacts associated with overshooting temperature goals set by the Paris Agreement. Actions should highlight regional differences in associated impacts and identify possible adaptation measures and solutions.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU in the range of EUR 4-6 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts. For the evaluation procedure, the following provision applies: at least one proposal per sub-topic will be funded, provided it passed all thresholds.

","Research and Innovation action
","12 November 2019
","03 September 2020","Specific Challenge:
Extreme high coastal water levels have increased at most locations along the European coastline. This increase appears to be predominantly due to increases in baseline mean local sea level rather than to changes in storm activity (IPCC 5th Assessment Report). According to recent studies, a 30 cm sea level rise by the end of the 21st century, in the absence of adaptation measures, would more than triple annual damages from coastal floods in the EU, from EUR 5 to 17 billion. Robust adaptation measures need to be undertaken in coastal and low-lying areas to protect them from increasing climate and sea level rise risks, including coastal erosion. Uncertainty of regional and local projections and lack of sustainable finance, public-private cooperation and knowledge and evidence-base have prevented authorities to take appropriate actions to prevent or mitigate coastal disasters. Filling these knowledge and innovation gaps will allow for the design and implementation of long term adaptation planning and cost-effective measures within an integrated coastal zone management (ICZM) framework to enhance the overall resilience of coastal cities[1] and settlements.
Scope:
Actions should capitalise on past and current initiatives and knowledge including associated uncertainty, to improve the integrated spatial planning, management and adaptation of Europe's coastal cities and settlements. They should provide scientific insight, tools, methodologies and innovative solutions to assist European coastal cities in developing their own coastal resilience plans and management and dynamic adaptation pathways (i.e. protect, accommodate, or retreat options), at spatial and temporal scales most relevant to their specific needs and context, to address the risks associated to climate change with emphasis to exposure to sea-level rise, while understanding the cascading effects and impacts on other sectors (e.g. water, energy, food, land use, etc.). Actions should use state-of-the-art predictions of the rate and extent of sea-level changes on time scales of years to decades to identify urban coastal areas at risk of flooding and erosion. The assessment and mapping of coastal exposure and vulnerability to sea-level rise should also consider low probability high impact scenarios (H++). Proposals should make use of existing Coastal Risk Assessment Frameworks, including socio-economic considerations, and informative tools for multi-hazard assessment.
As part of the proposed work, actions should develop a methodology for a thorough assessment of the robustness and effectiveness of protective structures measures and governance structures. They should come up with sound methodologies and guidance for the elaboration of resilience plans for vulnerable urban areas implementing, as appropriate, ecosystem-based approaches (e.g., Nature-Based Solutions, landscape planning) along with hybrid and traditional engineering approaches as part of a broader strategy. This includes the design of monitoring plans to detect signals for implementation and/or reassessment of the coastal plan. On the basis of an in-depth literature review and additional studies as appropriate, comparison of economic, social, cultural and environmental impacts (e.g. costs and benefits) of ecosystem-based approaches with the ones of traditional technical approaches should be undertaken, considering security aspects, cost-effectiveness, adaptability to changes and avoidance of undesirable lock-in effects. Actions should develop tools, methodologies and guidelines to assist decision making in selecting optimal mix of protection measures (ecosystem-based, hybrid, and traditional engineering) enhancing resilience for the diverse coastal contexts in Europe.
Action may include pilot studies comprising ""front-runner"" cities and territories advanced in the elaboration and implementation of coastal adaptation and resilience plans mentoring ""follower"" cities not so advanced in this process to enhance the potential for replication and up-taking of the outcomes and hence impact of the action.
Actions should envisage clustering activities with other relevant ongoing and future actions (e.g., LC-CLA-12-2020), relevant projects funded under previous and current H2020 Work Programmes for cross-projects co-operation, consultations and joint activities on cross-cutting issues and share of results as well as participating in joint meetings and communication events. To this end, proposals should foresee a dedicated work package and /or task and earmark the appropriate resources accordingly. They should make use and contribute to knowledge exchange and networking European platforms (e.g. Climate-ADAPT, ThinkNature, OPPLA).
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU in the range of EUR 10 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.

The project results are expected to contribute to:
improved decision-making on suitable adaptation options and coastal management strategies, in view of demographic, water supply, climate and land use changes on the basis of adaptation measures for specific local vulnerabilities, urban contexts and sectors in Europe and an assessment of coastal ecosystem services, adaptation costs and benefits,;

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
European mountain regions play a central role for the well-being of many highly populated European regions for instance for water and energy supply, weather regimes, recreation and tourism. European mountain regions are home to a high degree of biodiversity, including many endemic species that occur nowhere else. However, mountain regions are expected to react far more sensitively to global change than other parts of the world. Therefore, research on sustainability of these regions is important not only for the population living there and the many tourists visiting them (e.g. 150 Millions/year for the Alps) but for a significant part of Europe’s population. European countries operate excellent research infrastructures in mountain regions and are leading in many fields concerning climate, ecosystems, life in extreme environments, pollution monitoring and other aspects. Making the most efficient use of these resources and the latest scientific developments for addressing the abovementioned challenges, while contributing to climate change mitigation efforts targeted at this specific ecosystem, requires a high degree of coordination within Europe and beyond. Hence, a prominent challenge for this topic is to support and coordinate research and innovation to advance the understanding of current changes in mountain areas derived from climate changes, the synergies with other human–related forcing, the prediction of potential changes in these regions, and to foster observations for a sound monitoring of the regions.
Scope:
The action should coordinate and support mountain regions research in Europe and develop a comprehensive European Mountain Research Strategy building on existing European activities. This strategy should aim to support the development of services necessary for the adaption to climate change and the improvement and extension of observations, in particular in-situ ones, for the monitoring of the mountain regions. In line with Responsible Research and Innovation (RRI), citizens, civil society organisations and other relevant stakeholders should be involved in the co-design of the research strategy. This initiative strives for enhanced coordination with international research organisations and programmes related to mountain regions research (e.g. WMO, ESA, GEO, NEMOR and JPI 'Climate') as well as with relevant operational services including Copernicus. This action should support the implementation of the EU Strategy for the Alpine Region – EUSALP (https://www.alpine-region.eu/) and the GEO global Network for Observation and information in Mountain Environment – GEO-GNOME (http://earthobservations.org/geoss_wp.php), and take advantage of other regional and thematic networks initiatives that are being developed in Europe.
In line with the strategy for EU international cooperation in research and innovation (COM(2012)497), international cooperation is encouraged, in particular with countries such as Canada, China, India, Russia, United States, and Latin American countries.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU in the range of EUR 1.5 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
The project results are expected to contribute to:
substantially raising the scale and ambition of inter-disciplinary mountain regions research policy in Europe;
improved coherent and efficient use of European resources for mountain research;
significant extension of the Copernicus and EuroGEOSS services and products to the mountain regions;
step change in the domain of open data access, quality control and interoperability for mountain region monitoring and adapting to climate change.

Project results are expected to contribute to the following outcomes:
For supported doctoral candidates
New research and transferable skills and competences, leading to improved employability and career prospects within and outside academia;
New knowledge allowing the conversion of ideas into products and services, where relevant;
Enhanced networking and communication capacities with scientific peers, as well as with the general public that will increase and broaden the research and innovation impact.
For participating organisations
Improved quality, relevance and sustainability of doctoral training programmes and supervision arrangements;
Enhanced cooperation and transfer of knowledge between sectors and disciplines;
Increased integration of training and research activities between participating organisations;
Boosted R&I capacity;
Increased internationalisation and attractiveness;
Regular feedback of research results into teaching and education at participating organisations.
Scope:
MSCA Doctoral Networks will implement doctoral programmes, by partnerships of universities, research institutions and research infrastructures, businesses including SMEs, and other socio-economic actors from different countries across Europe and beyond. MSCA Doctoral Networks are indeed open to the participation of organisations from third countries, in view of fostering strategic international partnerships for the training and exchange of researchers.
These doctoral programmes will respond to well-identified needs in various R&I areas, expose the researchers to the academic and non-academic sectors, and offer training in research-related, as well as transferable skills[1] and competences relevant for innovation and long-term employability (e.g. entrepreneurship, commercialisation of results, Intellectual Property Rights, communication). Proposals for doctoral networks can reflect existing or planned research partnerships among the participating organisations.
The selection procedure for doctoral candidates must be open, transparent and merit-based, in line with the Code of Conduct for the Recruitment of Researchers. The vacancy notice (to be widely advertised internationally, including on the EURAXESS[2] website) must include the gross salary (not including employer’s social contributions) offered to the researcher.
MSCA Doctoral Networks are encouraged to lead to Industrial or Joint Doctorates.
Industrial Doctorates
Through Industrial Doctorates, doctoral candidates will step outside academia and develop skills in industry and business by being jointly supervised by academic and non-academic organisations, both of which can be established in the same EU Member State or Horizon Europe Associated Country.
Joint Doctorates
Joint Doctorates represent a highly integrated type of international, inter-sectoral and multi/interdisciplinary collaboration in doctoral training. They lead to the delivery of joint, double or multiple doctoral degrees[3] recognised in at least two EU Member States or Horizon Europe Associated Countries.
Steering Board
Each MSCA Doctoral Network should have a clearly identified steering board co-ordinating network-wide training and research activities and establishing continuous communication and exchange of best practice among the participating organisations to maximise the benefits of the partnership.
Training activities
MSCA Doctoral Networks should exploit complementarities between participating organisations and foster sharing of knowledge and networking activities for example through the organisation of workshops and conferences. Proposed training activities should respond to well identified needs in various R&I areas, with appropriate references to inter- and multidisciplinary fields and follow the EU Principles for Innovative Doctoral Training[4]. They should be primarily focused on developing new scientific knowledge through original research on personalised projects.
Inter-sectoral secondments of researchers to other participating organisations, including in third countries, are encouraged when relevant, feasible and beneficial for the researchers and in line with the project objectives. This will increase the employability of the researchers outside academia.
Doctoral Networks should develop substantial training modules, including digital ones, addressing key transferable skills and competences common to all fields and fostering the culture of Open Science, innovation and entrepreneurship. In particular, Doctoral Networks should adequately prepare doctoral candidates for increased research collaboration and information-sharing made possible by new (digital) technologies (e.g. collaborative tools, opening access to publications and to research data, FAIR data management, public engagement and citizen science, etc.).
Supervision
Particular attention is paid to the quality of supervision and mentoring arrangements as well as career guidance. Joint supervision of the researchers is mandatory for Industrial and Joint Doctorates.
Career Development Plan
A Career Development Plan must be established jointly by the supervisor and each recruited doctoral candidate. In case of joint supervision, such a plan should be established involving all supervisors. In addition to research objectives, this plan comprises the researcher's training and career needs, including training on transferable skills, teaching, planning for publications and participation in conferences and events aiming at opening science and research to citizens. The plan, established at the beginning of the recruitment, should be revised (and updated where needed) within 18 months.

","single-stage
Deadline date","Scope:
To support scaling up of companies in Europe, the EIC is seeking to build synergies with the wider European startup ecosystem via a new wave of actions under the Commission’s existing Startup Europe initiative. The actions will act as a catalyst to fulfil the potential of European startups, in delivering market-ready applications and technology solutions that can contribute to the competitiveness and strategic autonomy of EU industry in key technology areas and value chains.
Actions will reinforce the activities of the European Innovation Council by targeting digital and deep tech startups that have received support from EIC to support their scale up in Europe. The actions can support also deep tech startups not yet been supported by the EIC, including startups that have already received private investment or EU funding (e.g. under Horizon Europe or the Digital Europe Programme), and raise their awareness of the opportunities on offer from the EIC. It is foreseen that the targeted startup communities will contribute to development of applications that foster climate-neutrality, digital and circular economy, clean industry and user-centric technology development, while also encouraging inclusiveness, and incorporating European social and ethical values.
Connecting local digital and deep tech startup ecosystems and supporting crossborder acceleration activities for startups. Among the startups ecosystems to be connected, specific attention will be given to including of ecosystems in Widening countries.
Actions should also ensure the integration of startups with the Digital Europe Programme (for example from European Digital Innovation Hubs), the non-EIC parts of Horizon Europe (for example detected using Innovation Radar intelligence) and national programmes targeting startups. Actions should be published on the Startup Europe one-stop-shop and where relevant in the EIC Community, raise broad awareness of support for startups, while knowledge generated by the project(s) should contribute to EIC Business Acceleration Services and the general activities of the EIC Forum. Special attention will be given to support digital and deep tech startups and scaleups, wherever they are situated in Europe, to access innovation procurement opportunities (public or corporate procurers).

Projects are expected to contribute to the following outcomes:
Increase the awareness of Higher Education Institutions and research organisations to conventional and non-conventional threats
Boost the capacities of Higher Education Institutions and research organisations to deter and respond to non-conventional threats
Improve the resilience of Higher Education Institutions and research organisations
Scope:
The EU Higher Education Institutions and research organisations continue to face serious threats, such as to academic freedom, freedom of research and institutional autonomy, as well as increasing distrust in science and scientific experts, next to various forms of foreign interference. In addition, acute threats increasingly take non-conventional forms, such as cyber-attacks, infiltration or disinformation campaigns. These actions seek to access research findings, destabilise and endanger our higher education and research institutions and undermine our fundamental European values. To respond to these threats, the EU Higher Education Institutions and research organisations need to boost significantly their capacities in detecting and tackling these threats and they need to be well informed and geared with simple and effective tools ensuring security while respecting the openness of research and innovation. Given the very nature of the topic, continued exchange with member states and relevant stakeholders is necessary in order to expand the knowledge of conventional and non-conventional threats to Higher Education Institutions and research organisation, and develop appropriate actions.
Proposals are expected to: (i) analyse possible threats and identify mitigation measures; (ii) increase awareness of threats within higher education institutions and research organisations; (iii) promote networking and optimising of infrastructure and resources to ensure adequate preparedness and prevention at European level.
In the framework of the new ERA, this action should also complement and reinforce EU action for academic freedom as well as the European Pact for Research and Innovation, which aims at deepening the implementation of the new ERA’s objectives, setting out commonly agreed values and principles and indicating the areas where Member States will jointly develop priority actions."

","20 September 2016
","27 September 2017","Specific Challenge:
Building on the rapid development of ICT technologies, cooperative ITS and more accurate and reliable satellite navigation and positioning, automated road transport will enable driving strategies which are safe, sustainable and efficient on the level of the whole transport system. There are still many ICT-related challenges to overcome, in particular those related to the connectivity required for advanced levels of road vehicle automation and the architecture of such a connected ICT infrastructure.
Scope:
The focus will be on the development, testing and real-life validation of ICT infrastructure architectures, integrating state-of-the-art ICT technologies, systems and functions to enable the transition towards road vehicle automation (up to automation levels 3[1] and 4[2]). Proposals should bring together actors from automotive, IT and telecommunication industries as necessary to address one or several of the following areas:
―Functional and technical requirements for the required connectivity (V2V and V2I) for large-scale deployment of vehicle automation levels 3 and 4, by analysing the use cases for the deployment of stable and reliable connectivity over commercial telecom networks and over dedicated ITS spectrum. It is envisaged that both types of connectivity are needed for the deployment of large-scale automation. Proposers should address cyber-security aspects in depth.
―In relation to connectivity: architecture, functional and technical requirements for data generation, processing, storage and retrieval in the context of large-scale deployment of automation levels 3 and 4. Decision making processes needing data to operate vehicles and/or infrastructure should be distinguished from the provision of infotainment services and from other third party services. Regarding business models based on innovative, cross-sector use of data, proposers should address and analyse preconditions which might require public authority intervention. Proposers should address cyber-security aspects in depth.
―Tamper-proof in-vehicle platforms for automated vehicles building on and advancing the principles of cyber security for automated vehicles.
―Dynamic and accurate localisation and mapping, using cloud-based spatial data for highly automated driving (including sourcing, processing and information maintenance); accurate mapping and precise localisation based on European GNSS, using fully the capacity of vehicle connectivity and sensors and map data feedback loops; security of information enabling automated transport systems.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 5 to 15 million each would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
Actions will address the ICT-infrastructure related challenges to enable the transition towards advanced levels of road vehicle automation.
As described in the specific challenge above, actions are expected to contribute to improved evidence-based knowledge of required ICT-infrastructure architectures. Actions are expected to demonstrate how issues such as analysis of costs (investment, operations and maintenance) and requirements for interoperability, latency, throughput, congestion strategies, data verification and data integrity are considered.
Actions are expected to demonstrate how they will provide concrete, evidence-based input feeding into standardisation processes (notably supporting interoperability and cyber security) and policy decisions (e.g. for spectrum policy).
Considerable progress will be made regarding real time control systems for automated driving.
Actions will contribute to more reliable processing of information for automated transport based on data fusion algorithms to combine V2V and V2X information with on-board sensor information.
Actions will contribute to opening up a services market, as well as advancing public interest applications based on data captured from automation processes concerning e.g. the driver, the vehicle and the journeys made.
[1]Level 3 – Conditional Automation – ""the driving mode-specific performance by an automated driving system of all aspects of the dynamic driving task, with the expectation that the human driver will respond appropriately to a request to intervene"", according to the SAE International’s standard J3016.

Many developments and testing of automated vehicle solutions are already on-going in different European Member States and worldwide with varying framework conditions. There is a great need for creating a solid knowledge base of all these activities and a coordinated and harmonised approach at European and international level. Moreover, it is necessary to achieve a more efficient sharing and re-use of data and experiences of the different Field Operational Tests (FOT) in the area of road vehicle automation carried out at National and European levels.
Scope:
Proposals should address one or two of the following areas:
Area 1:
―Monitor the status of progress, coordinate and create a knowledge base on all ongoing research and demonstration activities in Europe and in the rest of the world in the area of road vehicle automation.
―Identify and gather a knowledge base on different automated driving scenarios in European Countries and worldwide, taking into account the available transportation system and infrastructure in these countries, including an analysis of the expected user behaviour for different user groups and the impact on the economy.
―Create a forum for National and European stakeholders of road automation to exchange experiences and knowledge on the development and deployment of road automation systems and to discuss future challenges.
―Support cooperation activities in the area of road automation at global level, in particular with the US and Japan.
Area 2:
―Establish a platform of data exchange in order to let individual Field Operational Tests of vehicle automation carried out at National and European levels benefit from each other's' learning experiences. A strategy for sharing and exploiting collected data in National, European and international FOTs should be developed.
For both areas, in line with the Union's strategy for international cooperation in research and innovation[1], international cooperation is encouraged. In particular, proposals should foresee twinning with entities participating in projects funded by US DOT[2] to exchange knowledge and experience and exploit synergies.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 0.50 to 3.00 million each would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
Actions are expected to provide a comprehensive picture of the state of the art of research and demonstration activities in Europe and worldwide in the area of vehicle automation, in particular with regard to emerging market prospects, standardisation and legal and regulatory framework.
Moreover, actions will achieve a better visibility, comparability and transferability of available results and data of Field Operational Tests of vehicle automation at National and European level. They will also lead to a stronger cooperation between research centres and other stakeholders in Europe and worldwide on common challenges in the areas of vehicle automation.
Proposed actions will contribute to higher penetration of automated driving functions in the market, resulting in both increased safety on the roads and lower emissions, and stronger market position of European industry in systems for vehicle automation.

Projects’ results are expected to contribute to the following outcomes:
Inventory and comparison of existing mobile laboratories, including heavy structures (both military and civilian) and light self-sustained systems, evaluation of quality management systems for maintenance, validation and testing.
New (mobile laboratory) solutions for the fast, reliable and unambiguous detection and identification of infectious agents, diagnostic tests, monitoring and mapping of contamination and enhanced field data communication to decision-making authorities.
Strategies to orchestrate mobile laboratory capacities in the EU, and improvements in the management of trained staff in Europe.
Scope:
The recent COVID-19 crisis has demonstrated that the ability to rapidly identify viruses on scene under a proper quality control/assurance regime is crucial to ensure adequate risk assessment, optimal risk management, and proper counter measures. Consequently, a determining factor is to bring a rapidly deployable diagnostic capacity as close as possible to the crisis area. Considering specific infectious diseases is of paramount importance as also is the possibility to develop scalable capacities for joint multinational intervention. In the EU Civil Protection and Health policy framework, mobile laboratories are increasingly becoming part of crisis responses and recovery plans, and the COVID-19 illustrated the needs for further developments in this area. Pandemics risk mitigation comprises prevention, preparedness and post-crisis management, including networking, regional and international partnership, consolidating, coordinating and optimizing existing capabilities in terms of expertise, training, technical assistance and equipment. There is a need for building synergies among existing initiatives to develop an EU capacity building by strengthening the national and regional capacities and staff training for mobile laboratories operation, long-term sustainability culture of safety and security.
In order to achieve the expected outcomes, international cooperation is encouraged, in particular with Japan in the framework of the EU-Japan collaboration on pandemics.
Where possible and relevant, synergy-building and clustering initiatives with successful proposals in the same area should be considered, including the organisation of international conferences in close coordination with the Community for European Research and Innovation for Security (CERIS) activities and/or other international events.

Projects are expected to contribute to some of the following expected outcomes:
Increased surveillance capability compared to the state of the art, including longer endurance, better reliability, lower maintenance requirements, longer permanence and wider coverage;
Improved performance and/or safety, including better detection, classification and tracking capabilities, cyber and physical security, better cost-efficiency, better autonomy, lower visual and acoustic signatures;
Improved multi-tasking capabilities to respond to a variety of needs and situations in the surveillance of border and maritime environment, including enhanced multi-authority collaboration.
Scope:
Border and coast guards, as well as other security practitioners, require capabilities to monitor wider areas beyond the EU external borders in order to prevent, detect and react to crime, including that crossing external borders, illegal border crossings and/or smuggling at the border regions of the EU and of the Schengen area. This applies to all border contexts – land, sea and air – but it may be specifically useful in the maritime domain, and these capabilities could also have a strong impact on other maritime security-related tasks beyond border control and for key dimensions identified by the EU Maritime Security Action Plan, including the civil-military research agenda. These capabilities should include monitoring for challenges and threats to maritime activities, including transport, maritime infrastructures and environments; contributing to measures to support vessels in distress and search and rescue missions; and scanning of coastal and border areas.
The solutions proposed by project proposals should reach advanced capability levels concerning detection, identification and tracking, including long endurance, persistence, reliability, and wide coverage. These platforms would be expected to have multi-tasking capabilities and be able to respond to a variety of needs and situations, including but not limited to environmental incidents, search and rescue needs, irregular migration and cross-border crimes. Platforms should offer cyber and physical security, be able to operate in groups/clusters, be highly autonomous, and offer increased endurance, taking into account better energy efficiency and cost-efficiency (including lower maintenance requirements) for security practitioners, low visual and acoustic signatures, and/or improved safety compared to the state of the art.
Solutions should be able to share their information products and integrate with existing and upcoming border and maritime surveillance systems in the EU, including EUROSUR.
Research and innovation activities could be conducted using a range of technological approaches (including but not limited to UAVs, balloon, blimps, High Altitude Platforms (HAPs), Lighter-Than-Air (LTA) solutions, microsatellites, satellite imagery, etc.) as long as the specific platform delivers the expected improved capabilities.
The specific platform should be brought at least to the level of validation, by European border and coast guard authorities, in an operational or real environment. Proposals should be convincing in explaining the frameworks they intend to use for demonstrating, testing and validating the systems; these frameworks will also include assessments of manufacturability, cost-effectiveness, efficiency and demonstrated integration with existing systems, and legal and ethical issues.
While some components studied could be more innovative and brought to mid-TRL, most components of the envisaged solutions are expected to arrive at high TRL and be demonstrated by projects in actual environments with operations and exercises for validation by practitioners. Proposals should also delineate the plans for further uptake (industrialisation, commercialisation, acquisition and/or deployment) at national and EU level, after the research project and should it deliver on its goals, of the solutions that they will demonstrate in the research project. Projects are also recommended to integrate impact assessments, including leveraging insights from previous research, in investigating and developing the solutions they propose.
Proposals under this topic are expected to address the priorities of the European Border and Coast Guard and of its Agency (Frontex) starting from the design of their work, and engage with the Agency in the development of the project. Proposals should give a key role to Frontex in validating the project outcomes, with the aim of facilitating future uptake of innovations for the border and coast guard community.
Research projects should consider, build on (if appropriate) and not duplicate previous research, including but not limited to research by other Framework Programmes projects.
Research projects should be complementary and not overlap with relevant actions funded by other EU instruments, including projects funded by the European Defence Fund and the European Defence Industrial Development Programme[1], while maintaining a focus on civilian applications only.

Improved capacity of practitioners and operators to deny the misuse of the postal and parcel service by criminal or terrorist group to move items;
Improved risk assessment, preparedness and reaction capacities in the postal and parcel service.
Scope:
Research under this topic will contribute to build capabilities for more effective detection of threats and of dangerous and illicit goods within postal and express courier flows, without impeding those flows or disproportionate intrusion into privacy. Currently there is a lack of technology that allows screening the volumes and at the speed of processing the parcels, making manual intervention necessary. At the same time, organised crime groups think they run a relatively low risk in exploiting postal and parcels supply chains to move a range of illicit and dangerous goods. Successful innovation could hence also have a deterrent effect on criminal organisations to use such channels.
Examples of threats and dangerous and illicit goods include explosives and explosive precursors, CBRN material, drugs, cash, contraband or counterfeit items, including counterfeit identity documents, and fake medicines. Detection capabilities should be built for post and parcels crossing the external borders of the Union, but also for internal shipping, but without introducing additional controls that may disrupt free movement of goods. Cooperation with operators of postal and express courier service in the research project is strongly encouraged. Solutions that could improve data quality, availability, integration among different steps in the flow, and interpretability, would also be welcome of projects.
Testing and validation, within the project, of developed tools and solutions in an operational environment, will be an asset. Proposals should be convincing in explaining the methods they intend to use for demonstrating, testing and validating the proposed tools and solutions. Proposals should also delineate the plans to develop possible future uptake and upscaling at national and EU level for possible next steps after the research project.
Research proposals should consider, build on if appropriate and not duplicate, previous research, including but not limiting to research by other projects funded by the Framework Programmes for Research and Innovation. Proposed research that could also link with innovation for fighting crime and terrorism would be an asset.
In order to achieve the expected outcomes, international cooperation is advised.

European Police Authorities benefit from better, modern and validated tools and training curricula to anticipate and cope with new and emerging technologies (notably 5G and beyond, as well as application-level communication, quantum computers and potential of quantum technology to encrypt communications) and facilitate their (specialised) daily work on prevention, detection and investigation of criminal and terrorist offences;
European common approaches are made available to policy-makers and security practitioners for analysing risks/threats, and identifying and deploying relevant security measures while performing lawful interception in this new age, which take into account legal and ethical rules of operation, cost-benefit considerations, as well as fundamental rights such as privacy, protection of personal data and free movement of persons;
Improved support in shaping and tuning of regulation by security policy-makers on lawful interception in case of new communication capabilities abused by criminals and terrorists, including on procedures and rules for the exchange of data retrieved from the lawful interception between Member States and on international scale, taking into account the court-proof nature of the evidence;
Increased contribution of Police Authorities to standardisation activity in relation with lawful interception and access to digital evidences, by fostering a European approach to the challenges posed by new technologies in the field of communication for the police and the judiciary;
Improved understanding of the capacity and usefulness of lawful interception in tackling terrorism and other forms of crime, and of the key challenges related to its capability to cope with new and emerging technologies.
Scope:
Software-based communication technologies such as 5G and beyond will bring many benefits but also pose a number of new challenges for the police and the judiciary. In particular, lawful interception systems will have to adapt to the increased use of encryption including end-to-end encryption, to edge computing that might limit the availability and accessibility to relevant data and to slicing technology that will multiply the number of virtual operators. In addition, high bandwidth access networks pose the challenge for police and the judiciary to be able to cope with tremendous amount of data and will accelerate the switch to application level communication that are commonly used by criminals. Finally, quantum computers could break current encryption standards, as well as be used to develop new ways of encrypting communications for illicit purposes, making them impenetrable to interception. Thus, there is a strong need to adequately tackle challenges for Police Authorities stemming from all these emerging developments as well as to make sure that lawful interception keeps track with these evolutions, respecting applicable legislation and fundamental rights such as personal data protection and privacy. Research activities proposed within this topic should address lawful interception challenges of Police Authorities related to both software based technologies of communication including 5G (and beyond) and quantum computers in a balanced way.

Projects’ results are expected to contribute to some or all of the following outcomes:
Contribution to the implementation of the 2020-2024 EU Action Plan on firearms trafficking;
Improved intelligence picture of firearms trafficking in Europe, modus operandi of such criminal organisations, both offline and online;
European Police Authorities, Customs and Border Guards Authorities, as well as forensics specialists and prosecutors benefit from modern and validated tools, skills and training curricula (including on the lawful court-proof collection of crime evidence) to tackle criminal activities related to firearms trafficking;
Harmonised procedures in the investigation of trans-border crimes in full compliance with applicable legislation on protection of personal data;
Improved cooperation between European Police and Border Guards Authorities, as well as with international actors, in tackling this form of crime;
Strengthened ability of security practitioners to identify organised crime networks involved in firearms trafficking in an early stage;
Reduced diversion of firearms into criminal hands in Europe;
Enhanced ability of security practitioners to prevent the emergence of organised crime networks involved in firearms trafficking, and respond to the threat of existing organisations;
Improved shaping and tuning of regulation related to the fight against firearms trafficking by security policy-makers.
Scope:
Firearms are the lifeblood of organised crime in Europe as well as worldwide. Firearms trafficking is a big enabler of organised crime and terrorism. It is a high-time to fix a new agenda by:
1) analysing possibilities for safeguarding the legal market and preventing diversion, notably by developing technological solutions for addressing new threats such as 3D printed firearms, including distribution of blueprints for 3D printing of firearms, clamping of 3D printing machines and of blueprints, and their sale both offline and online (including darknet);
2) improving the intelligence picture in firearms trafficking, in particular by developing technological solutions to enable simultaneous searches/input in the Schengen Information System and Interpol’s iArms database, developing solutions to facilitate and approximate a systematic collection on data on all firearms seizures, and developing a European-level tool tracking in real-time all firearms-related incidents or shootings and extracting continuously updated data;
3) increasing knowledge on the legal limitations and room for improvement in police and judicial cooperation in the field of firearms trafficking, developing tools to enable automated cross-border exchange of ballistics information, and exploring how new and emerging approaches (such as, but not limited to, Artificial Intelligence) could help improve automated detection of firearms and firearms components through scanning of parcels and containers;
4) improving international cooperation by supporting operational cooperation between the Police Authorities and other relevant security practitioners of the EU and of third countries.
Activities proposed within this topic should address both technological and societal dimensions of the firearms trafficking. Connections with other forms of crime should be tackled too. The international dimension should be analysed as well, including but not limited to the firearms smuggling processes. Thus, both Police and Border Guards/Customs Authorities should be involved in the consortia, in order to tackle effectively all aspects of this crime. Coordination with successful proposals under topic HORIZON-CL3-2021-FCT-01-08, HORIZON-CL3-2021-FCT-01-09, HORIZON-CL3-2022-FCT-01-05, HORIZON-CL3-2022-FCT-01-06 and HORIZON-CL3-2022-FCT-01-07 should be envisaged so as to avoid duplication and to exploit complementarities as well as opportunities for increased impact. Proposed activities that could also link with security research for border management (for example, border checks or detection of concealed objects) would be an asset. If relevant, the proposed activities should attempt to complement the objectives and activities of the EU Policy Cycle (EMPACT) – Firearms. Due to the specific scope of this topic, in order to achieve the expected outcomes, international cooperation is encouraged. The testing and/or piloting of the tools and solutions developed in a real setting with one or more Police Authorities and other relevant authorities is an asset; regardless, actions should plan to facilitate the uptake, replication across setting and up-scaling of the capabilities - i.e. solutions, tools, processes et al. – to be developed by the project.
In this topic the integration of the gender dimension (sex and gender analysis) in research and innovation content should be addressed only if the consortium deems it relevant in relation to the objectives of the research effort.

Projects are expected to contribute to some or all of the following expected outcomes:
Validation of innovative solutions for border crossing facilitation systems at European level for near-seamless and improved border crossing experience for travellers;
Increased security and reliability of border checks, including identification of people and goods crossing external borders, with stronger protection of people's fundamental rights and personal data;
Better organisation, flexibility and planning of border checks by European border authorities, including for handling peaks in cross-border traffic.
Scope:
Research should develop and systematically test and validate solutions to speed up and facilitate the border crossing experience (at land, sea and/or border crossing points for both travellers and staff of border authorities. Systems for easier border crossings, while maintaining security and reliability, would further advance one or more capabilities including the capabilities of border guards to do checks in mobility; of identifying and/or controlling passengers (and their vehicles and/or luggage) without stopping them; and/or of temporarily setting up or scaling up the capacity of certain border crossing points within a relatively short notice. Systems should integrate solutions being able to offer these capabilities in a flexible way and at the same time process border checks for a range of cases and types of passengers (for example EU nationals, third-country nationals, ETIAS/non-ETIAS eligible, persons recorded in a national facilitation programme, etc.).
For one aspect of the border crossing system, mobile or transportable technologies would enable authorities to quickly react to actual situations at the borders. In some scenarios, border checks are not only carried out in fixed crossing points, but also exceptionally in temporary points. New technologies can support authorities on document and information checks and verification (e.g. scanning passports, biometric verification, customs declarations, etc.), including health or security checks as necessary, establishing a secure and reliable communication channel to a backend service and providing immediate feedback to the field officer. Special considerations should be given to situations where officers operate in limited space areas (e.g. inside a train, on the road, onboard a ship in a port area). Equipment should not be heavy or bulky and should not restrict their freedom of movement. Solutions should have the potential to contribute to a better border crossing experience for travellers, operators and authorities, improving flows at border crossing points while maintaining or improving reliability and security of checks.
For another aspect of the border crossing system, research should advance the capabilities to capture and use biometrics of travellers without them having to stop and in natural contexts for border checks, in full respect of fundamental rights and considerations to safeguard data and integrity. Proposed research that could also link with innovation for fighting crime and terrorism beyond only the border checks (for example, biometrics capabilities that could help law enforcement to fight trafficking of human beings) would be an asset.
Projects should address the various components of an integrated system, test and validate it in real operational environment. Proposals should be convincing in explaining the frameworks (tools, methods, procedures, resources and criteria) they intend to use for demonstrating, testing and validating the operational performance of the systems; these frameworks will also include assessments of manufacturability, cost-effectiveness, efficiency and integration with existing systems.
While some components studied could be more innovative and brought to mid-TRL, most components are expected to arrive at high TRL and be demonstrated by projects in relevant, operational or real environments with operations and exercises for validation by practitioners. Proposals should also delineate the plans for further uptake (industrialisation, commercialisation, acquisition and/or deployment) at national and EU level, after the research project and should it deliver on its goals, of the border crossing facilitation systems that they will demonstrate in the research project. Projects are also recommended to integrate impact assessments, including leveraging insights from previous research, in investigating and developing the solutions they propose.
Proposals under this topic are expected to address the priorities of the European Border and Coast Guard and of its Agency (Frontex) starting from the design of their work, and engage with the Agency in the development of the project. Proposals should give a key role to Frontex in validating the project outcomes, with the aim of facilitating future uptake of innovations for the border and coast guard community.
Research projects should consider, build on if appropriate and not duplicate previous research, including but not limiting to research by other Framework Programmes projects such as those on border checks capabilities, risk-based integrated border control systems, travel facilitation, biometrics and document security, as well as and EU studies on potential applications of technologies to the improvement of border management capabilities.

Deadline date","ExpectedOutcome:
Projects are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:
Increased literacy on the value and efficient use of maturity assessment frameworks to communicate the readiness of technology, synchronise parallel developments, forecast implementation and support decision making in the planning of investment in the area of security;
Improved cross-disciplinary assessment of the maturity of innovative technologies based on common harmonised frameworks for the security domain;
Comprehensive and timely updated map of the maturity of the security solutions developed through EU-funded security research and innovation programmes enabled by widely accessible assessment tools and methods;
Evidence-based programming of security research built on a more reliable assessment of the state of the art technologies in the field of security.
Scope:
Having awareness of the maturity of a system is an invaluable reference to understand how ready this system is to be deployed on a numeric scale. Given the challenge posed by the limited uptake of the outcomes of EU-funded security R&I, having the capacity to characterise the progress achieved by security systems under development basing on readiness characteristics, and not only from a purely technological perspective, can be a powerful tool to identify areas that require further work or to provide input to strategic investment decision making processes.
Scales using metrics such as the Technology Readiness Levels (TRL) are widely used and have been adapted to different domains. Other scales have been developed, including Integration Readiness Level (IRL), Commercialisation Readiness Level (CRL), Manufacturing Readiness Levels (MRL), Security, Privacy and Ethics Readiness Level (SPRL) or Societal Readiness Level (SRL), among others. These may have been defined for different purposes and often focusing on non-technological aspects of technology development. However, problems emerge when readiness levels proliferate and are used without a commonly agreed definition, when they are not duly adapted to the specific context of application[1] or when they are implemented without the support of adequate tools and methods to carry out a reliable assessment.
Applicants are invited to submit proposals for the development of a maturity assessment framework that serves as a reference for the development of civil security technology-based solutions. The framework should be cross-disciplinary and combine different readiness scales in an aggregated manner in order to be able to deliver holistic and quantitative maturity assessments agglutinating different perspectives (e.g. technological, systemic, societal, etc.). The scales proposed should be robust, repeatable and agile, so they can be trusted, replicated, and applied to different types of security solutions in the different domains covered by this Work Programme.
The scales proposed have to rely as much as possible in existing and recognised scales and methods that show the appropriate quality features to ensure their reliability. Such scales need to be tailored and adapted to the security context as required in a justified manner.[2]
Based on the maturity assessment framework proposed, the project is expected to deliver tools that allow the guided and/or the self-assessment of the maturity of concrete security solutions being developed under the frame of EU-funded security research work programmes. These tools will allow an open access to those actors interested in assessing the readiness levels of concrete technologies, preferably through a web-based environment that allows for a high degree of automation. It is of particular relevance to allow open access to the online tools to actors participating in EU-funded security research projects so they are able to assess the progress in the maturation of their technologies throughout the project.
An extensive validation process for the developed assessment tools should be conducted as part of the project. This validation should be conducted by performing maturity assessments on different solutions recently delivered or currently under development in H2020 or Horizon Europe projects. The results of the maturity assessment should be made available to the projects collaborating with the validation for their own use and in support to their activities. The results are expected to be made available to other EC-chaired or funded initiatives for which this information can be of added value, such as the Networks of Practitioners projects funded under H2020 Secure Societies work programmes, to the Knowledge Networks for Security Research & Innovation funded under the Horizon Europe Cluster 3 Work Programme, to the Community of Users for Secure, Safe and Resilient Societies (future CERIS –Community of European Research and Innovation for Security) or to other security research and innovation working groups set-up by European Commission Agencies.
The project should explore the options, also from a business perspective, for the exploitation of the results beyond the project lifetime, including the setting up of formal mechanisms for the certification of readiness of security solutions by entrusted bodies.

Projects are expected to contribute to some of the following expected outcomes:
Improved large-scale vulnerability assessments of EU Member States’ (MS) or Associated Countries’ (AC) key infrastructures covering one or more types of infrastructure (energy, water, communications, transport, finance etc.) in more than two MS/AC
Improved cooperation to counter Hybrid Threats and subsequent large-scale disruptions of infrastructures in Europe, allowing for operational testing in real scenarios or realistic simulations of scenarios with specific regard to the cross-border dimension (intra-EU as well as non-EU)
Improved concepts and instruments for the anticipation of systemic risks to European infrastructure, allowing for comprehensive long-term risk assessments, with regards to climate change, technological trends, foreign direct investment (FDI) and dependence on critical supplies from non-EU countries
Improved risk, vulnerability and complexity related assessments for interconnected physical-digital European infrastructures aiming to increase security, resilience and design effective preventive, mitigating and preparedness measures and protect against and respond to cascading effects
Terrestrial back-up/alternative PNT solutions to ensure continuous operation of Critical Infrastructure in case of the disruption of GNSS services or other essential services
Enabling the decentralisation of large infrastructure to mitigate vulnerability in case of large scale disruptions
Enhanced preparedness and response by definition of operational procedures of both private and public infrastructure operators as well as public authorities considering citizens involvement (needs and vulnerabilities) in case of large scale infrastructure disruptions also with a view of assessing the combined physical and cyber resilience
Scope:
Security research related to infrastructure protection has been traditionally following a sectorial approach. With more and more infrastructure systems being interconnected, a stronger focus on the systemic dimension and complexity of attacks and disruptions by cyber or physical means needs to be applied. As such, not only interdependencies within one type of infrastructure (or closely related types) can be taken into account, but large-scale disruptions also with a view of the specific challenges of the cross-border dimension. Also, there is a need for a comprehensive strategy that takes into account different forms of interdependence (e.g. physical, geographic, cyber and logical).
In order to raise the awareness and preparedness for emerging risks, research should enhance the capabilities for foresight and risk management on a systemic level. As such, large-scale Vulnerability Assessments and risks management capabilities, as well as forecasting of emerging risks should be developed with a view of preparing for attacks or disruptions on the whole infrastructure of one or several EU Member States and Associated Countries. To allow for rapid and adequate response, simulations to prepare for systemic disruption of several key infrastructures are necessary. Since especially physical attacks on infrastructures in the EU are less frequent compared to other scenarios there is less empirical data available that can be used to improve protection. Furthermore, there is a lack of capabilities for testing protective equipment and training manuals. Security research can help to develop tools for operational testing in real-scenarios or simulated scenarios. Specific attention should be dedicated to Hybrid Threat scenarios, as defined by the European Centre of Excellence for Countering Hybrid Threats. The same is true for extreme natural events, which have the potential to disrupt several key infrastructures and whose subsequent effects are difficult to predict. Security research should in this regard support and complement obligations to better prevent and prepare for crises as set by the Union Civil Protection Mechanism.
Some essential sectors of the economy need uninterrupted access to the high-quality position and timing information provided for free by satellite navigation systems. Despite the fact that satellite navigation systems such as Galileo are made ever more robust to withstand risks and disruptions in terms of ground segments as well as space assets, there remain residual vulnerabilities that cannot be coped with when facing the emergence of new challenges. These critical sectors should therefore develop complementary positioning and/or timing solutions that are able to sustain a sudden disruption of GNSS service. This would make the vital functions of the society more resilient.
Infrastructure security research is in many cases transnational. While there has always been a strong European dimension in the conducted research, there has been less of a focus on cross-border scenarios with third-countries. Security research should therefore stimulate knowledge generation and cooperation with relevant third countries, which are vital for the functioning of European infrastructure. Examples could include energy, but also critical supplies, digital services or transport.
The means to attack infrastructure on a large scale have been rapidly enhanced by malevolent actors. Nevertheless, risks do not only emerge from intentional acts or disruptions, they can also grow over time based on other factors such as climate change, or lack of independence in critical technologies. Thus, better anticipation of systemic risks including forward-looking technological risk assessment and advanced screening of private interests related to ownership and operations (licensing), and FDI should be a key area of security research in the future. On a constant basis, information about the functioning and vulnerabilities of European infrastructures is unlawfully gathered for economic reasons, as well as with a view of preparing possible intentional disruptions. With the aim of safeguarding autonomy, more sophisticated tools against unlawful gathering of information on infrastructures need to be developed.

Projects are expected to contribute to some or all of the following expected outcomes:
An identifiable community of EU first responders with common user/functional needs for innovative technology solutions for situation awareness in the field of civil protection;
Tested and validated capacity of EU technology and industrial base to develop and produce technology prototypes for situation awareness in the field of civil protection that meet the needs of the EU user community;
Improved delineation of the EU market (including demand and supply) for situation awareness systems in the field of civil protection that can articulate alternative options for uptake in function of different industrialisation needs, commercialisation needs, acquisition needs, deployment needs and additional funding needs (beyond R&I funding).
Scope:
End-users and public procurers from several countries are invited to send proposals for launching a Pre-Commercial Procurement action for the acquisition of R&D services for the development of technology solutions for situation awareness in the field of civil protection.
The proposals should build on the outcomes of the SAYSO project, which followed the call 2016 of H2020 Secure Societies work programme, under the topic SEC-02-DRS-2016 - Situational awareness systems to support civil protection preparation and operational decision making. The successfull proposals will therefore give continuity to the works initiated by the SAYSO project.
Applicants should note that this project responds not only to the needs of EU stakeholders and to the policy priorities of the European Commission in the field of civil protection, but also to the capability needs and gaps identified by the International Forum to Advanced First Responders Innovation (IFAFRI). Therefore, applicants are encouraged to seek alignment with the needs of first responders as set out in the respective Gap Analysis, Statement of Objective and Deep Dive Analysis Documents which IFAFRI has produced[1].
The proposals are expected to provide clear evidence on a number of aspects in order to justify and de-risk the PCP action, including:
That the challenge is pertinent and that indeed a PCP action is required to complete the maturation cycle of certain technologies and to compare different alternatives;
That there is a consolidated group of end-users and procurers with common needs and requirements which are committed to carry out a PCP action in order to be able to take an informed decision on a future joint-procurement of innovative solutions;
That there is a quantifiable and identifiable community of potential buyers (including and beyond those proposed as beneficiaries in the proposal) who would share to a wide extent the common needs and requirements defined and who could be interested in exploring further joint-uptake of solutions similar to those developed under the PCP, should these prove to be technologically mature and operationally relevant by the end of the project;
That the state of the art and the market (including research) has been explored and mapped to the needs, and that there are different technical alternatives to address the proposed challenge;
That the PCP tendering process is clear, that a draft planning has been proposed and that the supporting documentation and administrative procedures will be ready in due time in order to launch the call for R&D services according to the PCP rules.
That there is a commitment to pursue the exploitation of results beyond the end of the project through engagement with stakeholders and implementation of exploitation strategies towards future uptake.
The open market consultations required prior to launching the PCP call for tenders must have taken place in at least three EU Member States. Market consultations conducted during the SAYSO project can be used if this requirement is fulfilled, and if it is justified that: i) their purpose was enough to guarantee the viability of the procurement and; ii) that the state-of-the-art has not changed since they were conducted.
In relation with the PCP tendering process, the applicants should clarify how they intend to guarantee that:
The principles of the EU Directive for public procurement and in particular with the provisions related to PCP will be duly respected;
Conflict of interests will be avoided, including through the ineligibility of bids from technology providers who are also beneficiaries of the project or who have been beneficiaries of the previous SAYSO project;
The confidentiality of the intellectual property of potential bidders will be protected;
The technology developments to be conducted in the PCP will be done in compliance with European societal values, fundamental rights and applicable legislation, including in the area of free movement of persons, privacy and protection of personal data;
In developing technology solutions, societal aspects (e.g. perception of security, possible side effects of technological solutions, societal resilience) will be taken into account in a comprehensive and thorough manner;
All participating public buyers commit to comply with EU data protection legislation in the development of innovative, advanced systems to support security and in particular the principles of data protection by design and by default;
The guidance for attracting innovators and innovation, as explained in the European Commission Guidance on Innovation Procurement C(2018) 3051, will be duly taken into account, in particular those measures oriented to reduce the barriers to high-tech start-ups and innovative SMEs.

A minimal preparation stage dedicated to finalise the tendering documents package for a PCP call for tenders based on the technical input resulting from project SAYSO, and to define clear verification and validation procedures, methods and tools for the evaluation of the prototypes to be developed throughout the PCP phases.
Launching the call for tenders for research and development services. The call for tenders should envisage a competitive development composed of different phases that would lead to at least 2 prototypes from 2 different providers to be validated in real operational environment at the end of the PCP cycle;
Conducting the competitive development of the prototypes following the PCP principles including, at least, a design phase, an integration and technical verification phase and a validation in real operational environment phase. In evaluating the proposals and the results of the PCP phases, the applicants should consider technical merit, feasibility and commercial potential of proposed research efforts.
Consolidating the results of the evaluation of the developed prototypes, extracting conclusions and recommendations from the validation process, and defining a strategy for a potential uptake of solutions inspired in the PCP outcomes, including a complete technical specification of the envisaged solutions and standardisation needs and/or proposals. This strategy should consider joint-cross border procurement schemes and exploit synergies with other EU and national non-research funds.
The applicants are expected to maximise the visibility of the project outcomes to the wide community of potential EU public buyers. Liaison with other communities beyond civil protection is encouraged (e.g. Border Guard and Police Authorities[2]) in order to assess the possible application of the identified solutions in different security research domains, such as infrastructure resilience, border management or disaster resilience.

Projects’ results are expected to contribute to some or all of the following outcomes:
European security practitioners benefit from better, modern and validated tools and training curricula on the use of travel intelligence to prevent, detect and investigate terrorism and other forms of serious crime (e.g., child sexual exploitation, drugs, human trafficking);
European common approaches are made available to policy-makers and security practitioners for analysing risks/threats, and identifying and deploying relevant security measures while exploiting travel intelligence information, which take into account legal and ethical rules of operation, cost-benefit considerations, as well as fundamental rights such as privacy, protection of personal data and free movement of persons;
Improved support in shaping and tuning of regulation on travel intelligence by security policy-makers;
Improved understanding of the capacity and usefulness of travel intelligence in tackling terrorism and other forms of serious crime, and of the key challenges related to it.
Scope:
Travel intelligence is intended here as all the information available in different systems and databases related to travellers. In particular, the research should focus on Passenger Name Record (PNR) and Advance Passenger Information (API) data, but the use of other data available in the context of the interoperability should also be envisaged.
PNR data are unverified information provided by passengers and collected by air carriers to enable the reservations and check-in processes. It may contain, for example, dates of travel, travel itinerary, ticket information, contact details, travel agent, means of payment, seat number and baggage information. As such, PNR is an important law enforcement tool allowing to prevent, detect and investigate terrorism and other forms of serious crime, such as drugs, human trafficking, child sexual exploitation and others.
API is commonly understood as the information of a passenger collected at check-in or at the time of online check-in. API information includes biographic data of the passenger, ideally captured from the Machine Readable Zone (MRZ) of their travel documents, as well as some information related to their travel.
Innovation is needed on methods to facilitate the data collection and their quality check as well as to combine different data sets, to sift through (and learn from) vast amounts of data for risk analysis, and to streamline the identity management of passengers, while taking care of the data protection and fundamental rights. Whereas, for instance, the blockchain technology is already being used in the logistics and supply chain management processes with promising results, there is little or no knowledge and/or evidence whether this technology could significantly improve customs/police passenger targeting capacity. The issue of having representative data sets for training and testing should be addressed as well. Namely, proposals should take into account the sensitivity of the travel intelligence data and which competent authorities are entitled to request or receive these data. Some of these authorities, notably Passenger Information Units (PIU)[1], should be actively involved in the consortia. Activities could be conducted utilizing various technological approaches (such as - but not limited to - Artificial Intelligence, neural networks, Big Data analysis, blockchain technology, etc.) as long as the developed solutions deliver the expected improved capabilities. The use of pseudonymisation techniques, rendering personal data unreadable yet searchable, should also be envisaged.
Coordination with successful proposals from topic HORIZON-CL3-2021-FCT-01-04 (on training and testing data issue as well as on pseudonymisation techniques) should be envisaged so as to avoid duplication and to exploit complementarities as well as opportunities for increased impact. Proposed activities that could also link with security research for border management (for example, border checks) would be an asset. The testing and/or piloting of the tools and solutions developed in a real setting with one or more Police Authorities and other relevant authorities is an asset. Applicants should plan to facilitate the uptake and replication across setting and up-scaling of the capabilities - i.e. solutions, tools, processes et al. – to be developed by the project.

Projects’ results are expected to contribute to the following outcomes:
Building up on existing initiatives, development of a consolidated platform gathering key actors involved in DRM for natural hazards and/or CBRN-E to identify on-going standardisation activities, discuss key features related to them, including classification, and prioritise actions (consultation, dissemination, research programming).
Setting a two-steps mechanism to (1) evaluate standardisation needs, taking into account existing and running activities, and establish priorities in close consultation with key users (policy-makers and practitioners at all levels, including Commission’s DGs, national and regional authorities and relevant actors), and (2) take actions relevant to the identified priorities according to their degree of maturity, including research programming in the Disaster-resilient Societies part of the Horizon Europe programme.
Establish a standardisation roadmap at international (ISO) and European (EN) levels, leading to improved coordination of activities at EU and international levels and cross-fertilisation among different sectors.
Scope:
Increasing resilience to natural disasters or CBRN-E events closely relies on management procedures, technologies and tools. An important feature supporting Disaster Risk Management and relevant international and EU policies is standardisation needed to improve the technical, operational and semantic interoperability of command, control and communication systems, or the interoperability of detection equipment and tools in the areas of CBRN-E. A range of actions have been undertaken to identify and prioritise standardisation activities, from pre-normative (design of new tools and methods) to co-normative (comparison / validation of existing tools and methods) research to mandate of mature items to European Standardisation Organisations via the CEN-CENELEC and ETSI. While some research projects delivered tangible CEN Workshop Agreements (CWAs) and made progress in standardisation-related research in the areas of natural hazards and CBRN-E civil protection and crisis management, no mechanism yet exists to ensure that standardisation is developed in close consultation with key stakeholders such as policy-makers and practitioners at all levels (European, national, regional and local). There is a need to ensure that any standardisation activities where a significant contribution to improve the disaster resilience through standardisation can be expected are developed in close cooperation with end users and prioritised with them while paying attention to the legal frameworks in place.
In this context it is important to remind that standardisation should support operations and policy-making to supplement it but should by no means substitute it. While standardisation of technology may be more straightforward, the right balance does especially have to be sought for processes. Based on existing or developing platforms, a prioritisation mechanism should hence be established, taking into account classification aspects (in particular in the CBRN-E sector), leading to decisions related to on-going or new standardisation items that should be directed in an organised way to pre- or co-normative research actions, CWAs or mandates, or to guidelines / Standard Operating Procedures not requiring formal standardisation (corporate voluntary agreements). This mechanism should have a close connection with future research programming and ensure close synergies with standardisation activities on European (e.g. CEN/TC 391) and international level (e.g. ISO/TC 292).
In order to achieve the expected outcomes of this topic, the involvement of chairs of relevant CEN and/or ISO Technical Committees in an advisory role/function is strongly encouraged."

Scope:
Research should investigate and define future capability needs for increasing the safety, security, performance and user experience of the operational staff of border and coast guards and of customs authorities. This also in view of the reinforcement of the standing corps of the European Border and Coast Guard Agency. Research should analyse capabilities to facilitate and/or protect the work of the operational staff, including their safety and security. Technological components may include security and safety solutions and protective equipment for deployed staff, advanced communication systems, advanced human interface devices and sensors. Capability needs and possible solutions should also be explored on increased situational awareness for border and coast guards and customs, including how to prepare for and manage changing situations; and/or on analytics support solutions for managing border and coast guards or customs staff, response and operations, taking into account legal and ethical, including data protection, requirements.

Projects’ results are expected to contribute to some or all of the following outcomes:
Use of modern, robust, validated, easy-to-use and reliable biometric technologies by forensic institutes and security practitioners, notably Police Authorities, improving European investigation capabilities to fight terrorism and other forms of serious and organised crime;
Shorter court cases due to the availability of more solid (cross-border) forensic evidence that is acceptable in court;
Policy-makers and security practitioners benefit from European common approaches for analysing risks/threats, and identifying and deploying relevant security measures while exploiting biometric information, which take into account legal and ethical rules of operation, the procedural differences in the creation of biometric information (considering the gender dimension where relevant), cost-benefit considerations, as well as fundamental rights such as privacy, protection of personal data and free movement of persons;
Improved support to policy-making on the use of biometric technologies by forensics institutes and Police Authorities;

Contribution to the development of European standards for the handling and processing of biometrics in the context of judicial investigation;
Forensic practitioners active in biometrics are provided with modern education and training curricula.
Scope:
Biometric technologies allow for a person to be recognised to a certain degree based on a set of features. These features can be more (e.g., fingermarks) or less (e.g., shoemarks) distinctive. In many cases, biometric technologies provide a crucial support to forensic investigation and as well as evidence in court. However, the full extent of their potential is not yet exploited. A wider use of these technologies by forensic institutes and Police Authorities in the European context and in harmonised way is needed, respecting applicable legislation and fundamental rights such as personal data protection and privacy. Thus, biometrics deserves a special innovation attention, which should include some of the following: 1) automation and scalability of the identification, identity verification, intelligence, investigation and evaluation processes; 2) robustness and validation of biometrics in forensic conditions; 3) biometric data protection and privacy; 4) harmonisation/standardisation of data and processes and conversion of existing biometric tool for use in the judicial system; 5) usage of biometrics in smartphones and other devices, including the possibility to unlock criminal’s devices using biometric data; 6) exchange of biometric data and interoperability of the systems, and risk of direct adoption of existing biometric tool for use in the judicial system.
One of the key priorities here consists in the need for forensic tools to combat organised crime and smuggling, with the aim of increasing crime investigation through more efficient detection, as well as intensifying prosecutions and convictions. The testing and/or piloting of the tools and solutions developed in a real setting with one or more Police Authorities and other relevant authorities is an asset; regardless, actions should foresee how they will facilitate the uptake, replication across setting and up-scaling of the capabilities - i.e. solutions, tools, processes et al. – to be developed by the project. Cooperation with the European Network of Forensic Science Institutes (ENFSI) is welcome. The issue of training and testing data has to be tackled as well. Thus, coordination with successful proposal in HORIZON-CL3-FCT-2021-01-04 is encouraged so as to avoid duplication and to exploit complementarities as well as opportunities for increased impact. Proposed activities that could also link with security research for border management (for example, border checks) would be an asset.

Projects are expected to contribute to some or all of the following expected outcomes:
Improved capability of customs and border authorities, at land, sea and/or air border crossing points, to detect drugs, illicit goods, weapons, explosive and other threats concealed on individuals or within their bodies, in the operational environment of border crossing points;
Safer, more efficient and more easily deployable solutions for detection compared to the state of the art are used by customs and border authorities, in particular avoiding ionizing radiation and minimizing any safety risk to users and operators and ensuring respect of fundamental rights.
Scope:
Research under this topic will increase the capabilities to detect objects concealed on persons, or hidden inside the body of persons. The proposed technology should be able to detect concealments on moving persons and should be based on non-ionising approaches that provide necessary safety and privacy. Proposed solutions should be harmless for users and operators (avoiding ionizing radiation, and include the assessment of the risk of any kind of toxic substances and/or potentially harmful techniques), provide fast detection and include easily deployable devices.
They should be able to detect weapons (including non-metallic weapons); explosives (combined or not with electronics), including homemade explosives (HMEs) and improvised explosive devices (IEDs); other threats and illicit goods such as drugs, tobacco or currency, concealed under or in the clothes or bags of individuals as well as within the individuals’ bodies. The need for such detection capabilities could be increasingly useful especially in contexts such as airports or ferry terminals where people board on foot or in vehicles, where a sufficient and efficient detection capacity will have to cope with substantial growth of passenger volume.
Proposed solutions must maximise respect of fundamental rights, including for dignity and privacy. In this sense, solutions should avoid explicit formation of images, physical contact or intrusive techniques. Solutions should also prove their potential to enable the quick scan of large flows of people, employing a minimum number of operators. Solutions should be systematically tested and validated in operational or real environments.
Research proposals should consider, build on if appropriate and not duplicate previous research, including but not limiting to research by other Framework Programmes projects such as on basic capabilities to detect concealed objects on individuals and in cargo or containers.

Projects’ results are expected to contribute to all of the following outcomes:
The relevant community (researchers, practitioners, industry, policy makers) is made aware of the legal, ethical and technical pre-requisites that a European common research training and testing data repository in the area of fighting crime and terrorism should fulfil (e.g., by defining how it should be organised or which characteristics it should have), which would include latest technology developments and allow for adaptations as technologies progress, while taking into account ethical rules of operation and fundamental rights (including privacy and data protection) as well as cost-benefit considerations that have to be made in the context of proportionality in strict sense (as a step to assess the lawfulness of a measure interfering with the fundamental rights);
The corresponding technical, legal and ethical basis for such a training and testing fighting crime and terrorism research data repository is set, that would allow for its creation in a subsequent step;
Security practitioners are provided with an increased interoperability and improved (cross-border) exchange of data thanks to harmonised data file formats across Europe, which would easily take into account technological evolutions, i.e. be adaptable in time;
Improved anonymisation and pseudonymisation technologies, including other security measures, such as masking and unmasking technologies to facilitate data management in this context, ensuring full access to the data actually needed (in line with the necessity and proportionality principle), as well as taking into account all applicable legislation and fundamental rights.
Scope:
The lack of realistic, up-to-date and sufficient training and testing data for research purposes has been regularly raised by the projects working in the area of fighting crime and terrorism (FCT), to the extent that such data are necessary instead of dummy and synthetic data. Namely, the accuracy of tools, notably (but not only) digital ones, depends heavily on the quantity and on the quality of the training and testing data, including the quality of their structure and labelling, and how well these data represent the problem to be tackled.
This issue is generally present in any research area, but it gets more emphasised in the, e.g., security, health or defence domain due to the special categories of data involved and the sensitivity of the domain, which calls for additional requirements to access to real datasets or the creation of representative datasets at a national level.
In EU-funded projects, in the area of FCT, the problem of having a scientifically satisfactory amount of up-to-date high-quality and realistic data needed to develop reliable (digital and non-digital - e.g., detection and/or qualification of explosives, drugs, DNA traces) tools in support of Police Authorities becomes even more complex. Namely, training and testing data sets considered legal and used in one Member State have to be shared and accepted in other Member States, while simultaneously observing fundamental rights and substantial or procedural safeguards.
In addition, with continuous and fast technological improvements, including but not limited to the Internet of Things, new data formats and mechanisms for data transfer, storage and security are and will be developed. In addition, data formats are often not harmonised amongst similar research projects, thus hampering potential interoperability requirements.
Another problem that is often encountered is a lack of trust between researchers and practitioners/end-users, as well as between different projects when it comes to data sharing. To this end, it is important to break down barriers between projects and keep on passing the message that the projects should not be competing to outperform each other, but working together to provide the EU with the best possible solutions. As a pre-requisite for all the above, there is a need to have a common research data repository.
The aim of this topic is to tackle this multi-layered issue and set the basis for such a common data repository by creating a roadmap consisting of a clear set of rules, conditions and characteristics that such a repository should have, be it the variety of the data in function of the type and of the problem at hand, legal issues, avoidance of any bias, accessibility levels related to the sensitivity of various data sets, harmonisation of data formats, solutions for annotation as well as for the aging of the data, etc.
As an integral part of proposed activities, apart from the above sets of requirements, technical solutions should be developed that could help research activities comply with privacy and data protection requirements when handling data, while being able to extract information if needed. Namely, as learnt from the previous research activities, standard pseudonymisation and anonymisation methods are not satisfactory in this domain, as they, e.g., either break the links between different pieces of evidence or take a lot of time and effort. Thus, new and/or improved anonymisation and pseudonymisation technologies, including other security measures, such as masking and unmasking technologies, should be developed to facilitate data management ensuring full access to the data actually needed (in line with the necessity and proportionality principle), in full respect of fundamental rights and applicable legislation.
Although proposed activities should focus on the research data for fighting crime and terrorism within the remits of Horizon Europe regulation (including ethics), proposals should take into account the possible application of the identified solutions in different security research domains, such as infrastructure resilience, border management or disaster resilience.
Coordination with the successful proposals from topic SU-AI02-2020 (on AI research datasets) and future successful proposals in HORIZON-CL3-FCT-2021-01-01 (on travel intelligence training and testing data for research purposes as well as on pseudonymisation techniques), HORIZON-CL3-FCT-2022-01-05 and HORIZON-CL3-FCT-2022-01-01 (on ground-truth data sets for conventional forensics) as well as HORIZON-CL3-FCT-2022-01-02 (on common data formats) should be envisaged so as to avoid duplication and to exploit complementarities as well as opportunities for increased impact. Possibilities of coordination with related activities in the Digital Europe Programme or European Open Science Cloud should be analysed too.
In this topic the integration of the gender dimension (sex and gender analysis) in research and innovation content is not a mandatory requirement.
The duration of the proposed activities should not exceed 24 months.

Projects’ results are expected to contribute to some or all of the following outcomes:
Improved intelligence picture of organised environmental crime in Europe, modus operandi of such criminal organisations, both offline and online;
Improved tools and innovative training curricula for European Police Authorities and Border Guards Authorities, validated against practitioners' needs and requirements, to help them tackle criminal activities related to environmental crime, supported by advanced digital technologies and including the lawful court-proof collection of crime evidence as well as environmental crime statistics;
Improved cooperation between European Police Authorities, Border Guards Authorities and other national Authorities involved in tackling this form of crime, including on goods not released for free circulation (e.g. in transit, warehousing etc.);
Improved cooperation with third countries and international actors involved in the fight against environmental crime;
Enhanced ability of security practitioners to identify and prevent emergent and existing organised crime networks involved in environmental crime;
Increased ability of public services to detect places of illegal waste storage;
Improved shaping and tuning of regulation related to the fight against environmental crime by security policy.
Scope:
Environmental crime breaches environmental legislation and causes significant harm or risk to the environment, climate and/or human health. Environmental crime is highly lucrative, but the sanctions are low, and it is often harder to detect than more traditional forms of organised crime. These factors also make it highly attractive for organised crime groups. These crimes present a high risk for the environment, climate and health, and are very harmful to society as a whole. The extent of the problem is clearly demonstrated by waste trafficking, which is characterised by the clear interconnection between criminal actors and legal businesses.
Nowadays waste traffickers operate along the entire waste-processing chain, rely on the use of fraudulent documents and group with other types of organised criminal activities. Police Authorities and other relevant security practitioners need new means, both technological and intelligence-based, to prevent and combat illegal environment-related activities, such as illegal waste dumping, waste trafficking and the illegal trade of refrigerants including ozone depleting gases and hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs). Innovative solutions are needed to support Police Authorities and other relevant security practitioners in finding polluting substances intentionally dumped in land and water (by, e.g., developing or improving existing technologies able to differentiate such substances from non-pollutant components, possibly involving remote sensing approaches), in detecting hazardous waste (e.g., fuel or electronic equipment), and in having a complete intelligence picture of this type of crime (such as modus operandi of the crime organisations involved in this type of crime, both offline and online).
The illegal trade of ozone depleting gases and HFCs also remains a significant obstacle to international efforts seeking to limit the worst impacts of climate change. Here, smuggling activities using in particular the custom transit procedures need to be addressed. Furthermore, one of the main issues with understanding the scale and specific issues are problems in developing comparable EU crime statistics. Therefore, activities proposed within this topic should address both the technological and societal dimensions of environmental crime in a balanced way, as well as the needs of Police Authorities and other relevant security practitioners. Connections with other forms of crime should be tackled too, as well as with other forms of environmental crime, which, similarly to illegal waste, pose a risk to health and society and are also reflected in Commission regulations – illicit wildlife trafficking, forest fires, illegal timber trade etc.
The international dimension, a crucial element in certain environmental crimes, should be analysed as well, including but not limited to the smuggling processes of illegal waste and refrigerants. Thus, both Police and Border Guards Authorities should be involved in the consortia, in order to tackle effectively all aspects of this crime. A particularity with environmental crime is the variety of actors involved at national level (inspection authorities, sanitary bodies etc.), so their participation would be welcome in the consortia.
Coordination with successful proposals under topic HORIZON-CL3-2021-FCT-01-08, HORIZON-CL3-2021-FCT-01-10, HORIZON-CL3-2022-FCT-01-05, HORIZON-CL3-2022-FCT-01-06 and HORIZON-CL3-2022-FCT-01-07 should be envisaged so as to avoid duplication and to exploit complementarities as well as opportunities for increased impact. Proposed activities that could also link with security research for border management (e.g., border checks) would be an asset. If relevant, the proposed activities should attempt to complement the objectives and activities of the EU Policy Cycle (EMPACT). If applicable and relevant, coordination with related activities in the Digital Europe Programme should be exploited too. Due to the specific scope of this topic, in order to achieve the expected outcomes, international cooperation is encouraged. The testing and/or piloting of the tools and solutions developed in a real setting with one or more Police Authorities and other relevant authorities is an asset; regardless, applicants should plan to facilitate the uptake, replication across setting and up-scaling of the capabilities - i.e. solutions, tools, processes et al. – to be developed by the project.

Projects are expected to contribute to some or all of the following expected outcomes:
Strategies for the resilience of infrastructure networks and services, and their interaction and vulnerabilities in a context of rapidly changing volumes and patterns of use
Understanding of inter-dependencies and strategies to overcome disruptions at local – regional – national and European (cross-border) level
Better understanding of the cascading effects of pandemics for different infrastructures and the services they provide
Improved procedures to reduce exposure of workforce to infectious diseases and mitigation strategies in case of the infrastructure disruptions or overload caused by the absence of critical workforce, surge of patients in the healthcare services, or disruptions of critical supplies
Scope:
Pandemics such as the COVID-19 crisis and other health risks have the potential to massively disrupt the functioning of infrastructures and vital societal functions. While this is most evident for the health system, the negative impacts reach much further. Resilient infrastructure systems particularly ‘lifeline’ services such as electric power, water and health care are critical for minimizing the societal impact of extreme events. It is essential to develop targeted solutions to ensure continuity of operations of different services and supplies, which are also critical to allow for prevention, preparedness and response to pandemics. This preparedness must also account for climate change as a “threat multiplier”, for example with heatwaves, storms, forest fires or flooding either accelerating the spread of a pandemic or rendering countermeasures like confinement less effective.
Member States remain the primary actors in preventing and responding to the outbreaks of infectious diseases. Enhanced European coordination into capacity-building, improved prevention, preparedness and coordinated response can support their efforts. In order to improve the EU-wide prevention and response to the specific challenges for the functioning of infrastructure in case of a severe infectious disease crises requires targeted security research which can deliver better knowledge, security risk assessment as well preparedness and response emergency planning tools. Public-private cooperation is absolutely essential in order to respond to a crisis as far reaching as a pandemic. Any comprehensive European approach to infrastructure resilience in case of a disruption caused by it, will need to take due account of this cooperation.
In infrastructure protection research, it is of high importance to understand the impact of the pandemic beyond the directly affected health system. The availability of specialised work force and vulnerability assessment of health capacities constitute the essential elements in this regard, as disruption of infrastructures due to the infection of large parts of a specific work force poses the immediate risk of cascading effects. The same is the case for integrated supply-chains for both critical goods, as well as non-essential ones. As such, understanding interdependencies, reducing vulnerabilities and identifying truly critical activities is key for enhancing overall societal resilience against pandemics.
A situation like the COVID-19 crisis, also puts the capacities of different infrastructures under exceptional stress, due to the rapidly increased demand for certain supplies and services and the ensuring change of load stress of different networks (as for example sudden increase in communication, decrease in transport, ensuring essential resources). Such changes in use-patterns open vulnerabilities, as for example increased cyber-risks in the event of teleworking or less physical protection due to staff contingency measures. Design of some critical infrastructure components, such as transport networks and critical manufacturing may in themselves be resilient to the pandemic threat, but put overall societal resilience at risk by promoting disease transmission and being unsuited to different mitigation measures.
The testing and/or piloting of the strategies developed in a real setting with one or more relevant public authorities is an asset; regardless, actions should foresee how they will facilitate the uptake, replication across setting and up-scaling of the capabilities - i.e. solutions, tools, processes et al. – to be developed by the project.
In order to achieve the expected outcomes, international cooperation is advised.
In this topic the integration of the gender dimension (sex and gender analysis) in research and innovation content should be addressed only if the consortium deems it relevant in relation to the objectives of the research effort.

Projects are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:
Improved and professionalised NCP service of knowledge, experience and skills, consistent across Europe, thereby helping simplify access to Horizon Europe calls, lowering the entry barriers for newcomers, and raising the average quality of proposals submitted;
Harmonised and improved trans-national cooperation between NCPs, paying particular attention to the engagement of NCPs from associated partners, eventually not directly involved in the consortium, with the aim of ensuring the same level of information and quality to all National Contact Points, inside and outside the network;
Periodic and timely evidence-based policy feedback in support to EU-funded security research programming enabled by a seamless integration of the national, regional and local dimensions of security Research and Innovation into the EU picture;
A systematic assessment of the needs of the various stakeholders involved in security and Cybersecurity research projects and programmes with respect to identified learning opportunities through harmonised support mechanisms;
Collaboration with other Member States’ organisations providing support to Horizon Europe applicants in the domain of Cluster “Civil Security for Society”, for example the future National Coordination Centres created through the proposed Cybersecurity Competence Centre and Network Regulation[1];
A more reliable measurement of the impact of security research and innovation built, inter alia, on a quantitative and qualitative assessment of the participation in the different Programme calls and a better awareness of the innovation-uptake success stories stemming from the participation of national players in EU-funded security research projects;
Collaboration, including NCPs in third countries, through specific NCP networking projects in the different Horizon Europe programme areas to address and advise the respective communities better and more specifically.
Increased cooperation of NCPs with the Enterprise Europe Network.
Scope:
National Contact Points (NCPs) are support structures that have become an essential component in the implementation of successive Framework Programmes. They provide information and on-the ground advice to potential applicants and beneficiaries, through the project life cycle, in their own language, in a manner that would be impossible for the European Commission and its Agencies acting alone.
The NCPs are the main structure for providing practical information and assistance to potential participants. They are ambassadors for Horizon Europe, perceived as true and impartial partners of the European Commission Services and its Agencies. The system of NCPs will be established, operated and financed under the responsibility of the Member States and Associated Countries.
NCPs can also help to give visibility to different perspectives of all Security Research and Innovation (R&I) stakeholders and to break geographical silos by aggregating the knowledge existing in the EU Member States and regions and incorporate it to the European picture. This should reinforce the development and testing of new security solutions in European Regions, drawing on their local characteristics, strengths and specialisation and contribute to the push towards a “Place-based innovation and experimentation” brought by the New Industrial Strategy for Europe[2].
As highly professional support services, NCPs operating nationally will form an essential component of Horizon Europe implementation. They will have a key role in delivering the Programme’s objectives and impacts ensuring that it becomes known and readily accessible to all potential applicants, irrespective of sector or discipline.
A system of NCPs will be established for the Horizon Europe Cluster 3 “Civil Security for Society”, building on the experience of previous Framework Programmes.
The Horizon 2020 Secure Societies Work Programme comprehensively addressed the current security policy framework and key challenges. In specific, it aims at securing the society against disasters, fighting crime (including cybercrime) and terrorism, securing European borders, supporting the Union's external security policies in civilian tasks, and last but not least, increasing digital security.
In Horizon Europe, those challenges are to be addressed through various mechanisms tailored to the different actors, and by implementing actions at different levels, e.g. Research and Innovation Actions, Innovation Actions, Coordination and Support Actions and Pre-commercial Procurement Actions. Complementary actions include boosting communication, dissemination and exploitation; fostering the testing, validation and demonstration of innovative technologies; as well as strengthening the links between the R&I community actors.
NCPs will be called to support and enhance this approach by, inter alia, facilitating access of all relevant actors to funding opportunities; providing generic and sector specific information and advice, enabling contacts with strategic actors, organisations and initiatives and addressing the need to seek and provide consistent coordination among actors.
The activities of the NCP Network should be tailored according to the nature of the area, and the priorities of the NCPs concerned. Special attention should be given to enhancing the competence of NCPs, including helping less experienced NCPs rapidly acquire the know-how built up in other countries.
The successful proposal will contribute to delivering the Programme’s objectives and impacts and raise awareness of potential applicants for calls under Horizon Europe Cluster 3 – ""Civil Security for Society"". Irrespectively of their sector or discipline, project proposals should aim to facilitate trans-national co-operation between NCPs, with a view to identifying and sharing good practices and raising the general standard of support to Programme applicants. The project should also allow for a better flow of information relevant for the implementation of the Programme from the EU level to the national level and vice-versa, and also across Member States and Associated Countries. This includes fostering the participation of national players in EU security research and innovation fora.
The NCP network should explore the possibility to increase the visibility at EU level of the results and impact achieved by national players following their participation in R&I projects. Particular attention should be given to results that have led to the deployment of solutions in the field of operations, or that show a strong potential for uptake because of the interest expressed by national buyers.
Proposals should include a work package to implement matchmaking activities to link up potential participants from widening countries with emerging consortia in the domain of the Cluster “Civil Security for Society”. Matchmaking should take place by means of online tools, brokerage events, info days and bilateral meetings between project initiators and candidate participants from widening countries. Other matchmaking instruments may be used as appropriate. Where relevant, synergies should be sought with the Enterprise Europe Network to organise matchmaking activities in accordance with Annex IV of the NCP Minimum Standards and Guiding Principles.
The project proposal to be funded should cover a wide range of activities related to Horizon Europe, address issues specific to the Cluster ""Civil Security for Society"" and may follow up on the work of SEREN4.
The project consortium should have a good representation of experienced and less experienced NCPs.
The proposed Cybersecurity Competence Centre and Network Regulation[3] inter alia establishes a Network of National Coordination Centres. These National Coordination Centres will be tasked, amongst others, to facilitate the participation of industry and other actors at the Member State level in cross-border projects and to act as contact point at the national level for the Cybersecurity Competence Community and the Competence Centre. Therefore, proposals should also take into account support activities for coordination between the respective beneficiary (NCP) and the respective National Coordination Centre within the relevant Member States as applicable once the regulation mentioned above is in force.
The recommended duration of the project is 3 years.

In support of the European Green Deal and EU water-related policies, the successful proposal will contribute to foster the adaptation of water resources to climate change, contributing therefore to Destination ‘Land, ocean and water for climate action’ impact “Advance the understanding and science, and support adaptation and resilience of natural and managed ecosystems, water and soil systems and economic sectors in the context of the changing climate”, as well as preserve and restore ecosystems and biodiversity, prevent pollution in land and seas, enhance food security, foster sustainable and circular management of water resources and innovative governance.
Projects results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:
Increased protection of water resources and ecosystems and strengthening of biodiversity, by developing a more systemic and integrative policy which considers cross-sectoral interactions (water, biodiversity, agriculture, fisheries and aquaculture, energy, health).
Enhanced resilience, mitigation and adaptation of water systems to climate change and multiple interacting stressors.
Pooled resources (EU, Member States, Associated Countries, European platforms and economic sectors) and alignment within a shared and co-developed strategic research and innovation agenda (SRIA) and related implementation plans and better embedding of national and regional knowledge and innovation ecosystems within that of the EU.
Leverage impacts of policies on the water security crisis, by upscaling projects (from research to demonstration) and supporting policy implementation based on cooperation, across stakeholders and sectors.
Strengthened alignment between funders’ programmes and timelines and knowledge transfer, and addressing the lack of continuity of funding from research to implementation and difficulties in securing long-term investments.
Greater cooperation across sectors, with multi-stakeholder engagement and empowerment, to co-develop and co-implement solutions and to drive the necessary societal transformations required for securing water for all.
Reinforced role of the EU in the international water agenda (implementation of UN SDGs) and in strengthening water diplomacy.
Science and evidence-based implementation of the European Green Deal and EU water-related policies.
Scope:
Water resources are vital for all human activities and the environment. Ensuring that enough water of high quality is available for all purposes remains a key challenge globally and within Europe.
Global trends project world-wide growth in water use by 55% by 2050, due to growing demands from manufacturing, thermal electricity generation, agriculture and domestic use, all increasing the pressure of human activities on our freshwater resources. Furthermore, water quality is declining due to agricultural, industrial, mining and urban pollution, impacting the availability of water of sufficient quality for users. According to the recently released Global Assessment by the Intergovernmental Platform for Biodiversity and ecosystem services (IPBES), freshwater biodiversity is declining rapidly. Hydrological extreme events, such as floods and droughts, are going to increase, according to the latest IPCC conclusions, exacerbating the water crisis and impacts across all economic sectors.
Achieving good status of Europe’s surface waters and providing enough water for all, is not only important for the implementation of EU water related policies, it is also an essential element for achieving other EU related policies, such biodiversity, agriculture, climate and energy related policies. Water is also central to all components of the European Green Deal. There is, therefore, a need to produce science-based knowledge to support the European Green Deal and other EU policies by monitoring problems related to water and developing feasible technical and managerial solutions.
Water is a dedicated UN Sustainable Development Goal (namely SDG6) but it will not be achieved by 2030 at current rates, considering trends in financing, capacity and political commitments. This will also undermine progress towards most of the other SDGs, particularly the goals related to poverty, hunger, health, clean energy, cities, climate, life below water and life on land, but also gender equality and peace, which are all related to water.
The diversity of challenges we are now facing to secure water for all, requires a new co-funded partnership that brings together all public and private research funders and supports a more efficient collaboration and integration of EU, Member States and Associated Countries R&I activities related to water. This will ensure a transition to a healthy planet, respectful of planetary boundaries, a resilient Energy Union, and implementation of an EU policy of climate neutrality, in line with Horizon Europe priorities.
It also requires the alignment and/or integration of different research and innovation agendas and of EU and national programmes, coordination of funding agencies and commitments to implement a long-term strategy that would deliver major changes and impacts. Based on a shared and co-constructed SRIA, such a partnership should combine bottom-up and top-down approaches to reconcile needs whilst pooling resources from different sources. It should foster consortium building and help leverage between existing initiatives under common broader or specific objectives. This will give direction and shape to a common water implementation strategy.
A European partnership is also necessary to deliver an objective and impact-driven approach and build critical mass in resources (human and financial), expertise and capacities in the longer-term, in line with the challenge faced. This would allow for the mobilisation of additional national resources with access to other instruments / financing / investments along the same strategic research agenda (e.g. real-life testing sites, research infrastructures, and innovation hubs or competitiveness clusters), contributing from collaboration that benefits existing European, national and local ecosystems.
Tackling the global challenges also requires different forms of cooperation (to maximise the types and number of partners involved). This would allow implementation of a larger range of types of actions, such as development of academic and applied research, innovative solutions, including collaboration with enterprises in projects, transfer of innovation to enterprises, addressing the science/policy interface, while having better access to research infrastructures and connections to implementation tools (financial, regulatory), demonstration and training.
The co-funded European Partnership Water Security for the Planet (Water4All) should address the following vision: “Boosting the systemic transformations and changes across the entire research – water innovation pipeline, fostering matchmaking between problem owners and solution providers to ensure water security for all in the long term”.
Water4All should propose a portfolio of multi-national, multi-faceted and cross-sectoral approaches, encompassing policy, environmental, economic, technological and societal considerations to enable water security for all in the long term. It should therefore be implemented through a joint programme of activities ranging from research and innovation programme coordination to new knowledge and innovation development, transfer to policy-making, operational implementation and demonstration of the efficiency of solutions. It should be structured according to the following pillars:
Identify research and innovation priorities to strengthen alignment of EU and national RDI programmes and increase the impact and policy relevance.
Develop new knowledge and innovative solutions for a systemic and inclusive approach to water challenges at operational scale (e.g. river basin, water catchment).
Transfer knowledge and innovation to i) policy-makers and ii) operators / managers so that they are able to implement the proposed solutions.
Demonstrate the efficiency and the sustainability of the proposed solutions at local level, in close cooperation with the relevant actors (including policy-makers and decision-makers).
Increase and strengthen international cooperation to develop a critical mass in relation to the global challenges faced.
This will create a continuum from the identification of the challenges to the demonstration of proposed solutions, ensuring a more rapid translation of research and innovation into concrete applications and uptake by relevant managers and citizens.
Water4All should rely on a core group composed of R&I programme owners and funders from ministries in charge of R&I policy and agencies, policy makers from ministries in charge of environmental policy and environmental / water protection agencies, from the EU, neighbouring countries and beyond the EU, as core members, in close cooperation with a wide range of other research and economic actors (multinational corporations, suppliers & SMEs, research & technology developers, water utilities, civil society organisations). Partners are expected to provide financial and/or in-kind contributions for the governance structure, the joint calls, and other additional activities. To achieve the international cooperation objectives, collaboration with non-European countries is strongly encouraged.
The partnership is open to all EU Member States, as well as to countries associated to Horizon Europe and will remain open to such countries wanting to join.
To ensure the coherence and complementarity of activities, and to leverage knowledge investment possibilities, the partnership is expected to foster close cooperation and synergies with other ongoing EU and nationally funded R&I activities, the Horizon Missions on Healthy Soils; on Ocean, seas and waters; on Climate Adaptation and on Cities, relevant Horizon Europe partnerships (Chemical Risk Assessment, Driving Urban Transition, Waterborne, Biodiversity, Blue Economy, Safe and Sustainable Food System, Agro-ecology living labs) and other programmes/initiatives (such as Cohesion Policy funds, LIFE programme, COST actions, Development and International Cooperation funds, ESA/Copernicus, KIC Climate, PRIMA, follow-up of BONUS). Proposers are expected to describe in details the way to implement such collaborations.
Proposals should pool the necessary financial resources from the participating national (or regional) research programmes with a view to implementing joints call for transnational proposals resulting in grants to third parties.
The Commission envisages to include new actions in future work programme(s) to continue providing support to the partnership for the duration of Horizon Europe.

Projects are expected to contribute to the following expected outcomes:
Strengthened links and collaboration between citizen science initiatives and other research and innovation actors;
Increased capacity to conduct excellent research and innovation through citizen science, while maximising other potential benefits of citizen science;
Data infrastructures better aligned to the needs of citizen science, and improved data practices employed by citizen science initiatives;
Europe positioned as a leader in citizen science throughout the entire research and innovation system with flourishing and mutually beneficial global collaborations.
These targeted outcomes in turn contribute to medium and long-term impacts:
Increased engagement of citizens in research and innovation;
Increased public trust in research and innovation;
Increased capacity in the EU R&I system to conduct open science and to set it as a modus operandi of modern science;
Increased openness of the EU R&I system.
Scope:
Citizen Science is a rapidly emerging mode of research and innovation that shows huge promise in terms of collecting new qualities and quantities of data, harnessing collective intelligence, improving science-society literacy, and improving the relationship between science and society. However, it is embedded institutionally only to a limited extent, at an early stage of developing data infrastructures, and lacks the capacities and sustainable resourcing required to live up to its potentials.
This action will become a central point of exchange between citizen science in Horizon 2020, Horizon Europe, and other EU-level and sub-national programmes and initiatives. It should amplify significant outcomes of citizen science in areas such as Horizon Europe’s Missions, should they be confirmed, Clusters and Partnerships, the Sustainable Development Goals, and the Green Deal, across all parts of the research and innovation system. It should maintain up-to-date repositories of initiatives, good practices and tools, and become a stage for discussion and collaboration.
It should offer extensive in situ brokering, skills, training, and capacity building services to citizen science practitioners, civil society, public authorities, businesses/SMEs, formal and informal education establishments, and research funding and performing organisations, with a view to raising their awareness, knowledge and skills to collaborate with, support, and implement citizen science.
Co-ordination of and support for citizen science to work towards FAIR (and in many cases open) data should cut across activities. The action should become a key interlocutor between citizen science initiatives and existing thematic databases and infrastructures. It should support - and ‘connect the dots’ between - existing efforts to make citizen science data FAIR and open, make new efforts to liaise between citizen science and infrastructures where they are needed, identify unmet needs, and develop policy recommendations. Overall the action should move citizen science towards open science as its modus operandi.
Underlying these activities should be efforts to reduce disparities in awareness and actual practice of citizen science across disciplines in the ERA (e.g. at local, regional, national and EU levels). Moreover, significant efforts should be made to be inclusive in citizens’ involvement in terms of geography, gender, ethnicity, disability, age, socio-economic background etc. In order to achieve the expected outcomes, international cooperation and mutual learning that promise tangible scientific, societal or policy impacts is advised.
The action should build on and valorise the results of earlier projects in the Science and Society (FP6), Science in Society (FP7) and Science with and for Society (Horizon 2020) programmes, in particular projects focused on public engagement, responsible research and innovation, and citizen science , as well as of national and regional initiatives, and should aim to provide a seamless transition between previous supporting actions and this new action.
The action should be no shorter than 3 years.

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Regions may play a key role in the establishment of bio-based industries by providing a favourable business environment and the necessary political framework. Few regions in Europe are in the process of building successful ""bio-based industries"" demonstrator case studies. Those that do exist are largely in the regions with established industries (chemical, energy, pulp and paper, etc.).
Strategies and implementing modalities should be shared in particular with regions that have as yet unexploited biomass or waste resources so as to widen participation of countries, fully exploit the potentials of the bio-based economy in Europe and contribute to rural and coastal renaissance. Bio-based industries and products offer new opportunities for regional and local actors using alternative resources and maximising possibilities for agricultural, forest and urban waste to be valorised. Development of synergies with the regional innovation strategies for the bio-based economy will boost the competitiveness of the region and its stakeholders on a national, European and international level. Local actors may equally attract investments from other partners for establishing a favourable bio-based ""ecosystem"".
Scope:
Proposals will create a stakeholder platform of regional and local organisations (regional authorities or mandated agencies or clusters) interested in developing ambitious strategies in support of bio-based products/industries, with the aim to attract new investments in industrial projects. Building on the ""model demonstrator regions"", successful case studies shall be shared and transposed to other interested European regions. Industries, regions and investors should be brought together to establish an efficient dialogue between actors so that demand and supply can be aligned, establishing best practices and examples that can be followed by others.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of up to EUR 1 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude the submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
To widen the participation of countries developing regional bio-based strategies, proposals will have to:
constitute effective networks of stakeholders – local and industrial- for the implementation of concrete projects along the value chains of products to be used as demonstrators;
identify new opportunities at regional and local level and define mechanisms, tools, approaches, examples of good practice, guidelines, and further actions that may facilitate joint and/or complementary investments in research and innovation in the field of bio-based products.

","Bio-based Industries Research and Innovation action
","19 April 2016
","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
With the introduction of several and different feedstock, the risk of contamination increases due to longer fermentation times and weaker genetically modified production organisms. This leads to more stringent requirements for control of contamination within the bio-catalysis reactor. The objective is to overcome this challenge without exacerbating cumbersome sterilisation procedures or increasing the use of antibiotics, which would spread antibiotic resistance in the microorganisms. The latter would reduce the overall efficiency of the processes and impose an increasing substitution of the currently utilised microorganisms with new and more resistant strains.
In addition, residual antibiotics found in biorefinery side-streams hinder their potential use as a secondary feedstock for food/feed applications, as the EU regulatory framework in place needs to be taken into full account.
Hence, the use of antibiotics in bio-catalytic processes, although beneficial in controlling microbial growth, presents several drawbacks mainly associated with the risk of increasing antibiotic microbial resistance, as well as with the reduction of market value of the side-streams containing traces of antibiotics because of regulatory aspects.
The challenge is to develop other methods to control contamination. Alternatives include for instance microbial consortia (including synthetic consortia), non-antibiotic antimicrobials (like phages), more robust production microorganisms and more suitable bio-reactor conditions. These new methods should lead to expanding the potential feedstock basis and promoting the market position of bio-catalytic processes by:
improved tools, methods and production organisms;
repressing contamination to the level that complies with the end-use of the products (e.g. compliant to limits in feed or food applications), while avoiding or reducing the use of antibiotics.
The result could be a wider market deployment of by-products and residues, and technical and environmental benefits from limiting antibiotics resistance.
Scope:
Improve the techniques for microbial control in bio-catalysis. The improvements should include less cumbersome sterilisation steps and use of improved bio-catalyst microorganisms and process conditions to curb contamination, avoiding the use of antibiotics.
Proposals should provide process yields at least comparable to the state-of-the-art. Proposals should also result in relevant improvements of the market value of by-products and side-streams, as compared with the current technologies.
Proposals should assess the feasibility of scaling-up the developed solution and the potential for replication into a wide range of bio-catalytic processes and value chains, allowing a better and larger application of the innovative techniques with the aim of avoiding or controlling contamination.
In addition, proposals should include high levels of safety and sustainability, from technical, economic and environmental points of view, required for feasible scale-up towards demonstration levels.
The projects should cover any Technology Readiness Level (TRL) from 3 to 5. In the case of a pilot scale project (TRL 5), proposals should present a credible cost estimate for the proposed processes with a preliminary assessment of their competitiveness when scaled up.
Proposals should also include an environmental and socio-economic assessment, for example with an LCA. In particular, when targeting TRL 5, proposals should include an LCA in order to evaluate the environmental and socio-economic performance of the developed processes.
It is considered that proposals with a total eligible budget in the range of EUR 2-5 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals with another budget.
Expected Impact:
New bio-catalytic tools, methods, processes and microorganisms with a greater resistance against contamination and capacity for longer duration fermentations, including continuous fermentation.
Technical and economic improvements in the management activities of bio-catalytic processes, especially the reduction of 20% of the costs associated with the control of the microbial growth.
Introduction of new routes and technologies for bio-based processes able to reduce their scale-up time as well as the time-to-market of the resultant products.
Improved competitiveness of the new bio-based value chains as compared to the existing ones.

","04 April 2019
","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Due to their high productivity and their potential for avoiding competition with arable lands, microalgae are regarded as a valuable feedstock for biorefining operations. Microalgae are a potential source of molecules for a wide range of novel high-value products in different applications such as energy, fuel, food, feed, pharmaceutical and cosmetics. However, their current production scale and costs are holding back full-scale commercialisation steps. The main challenges regard: (i) efficiency of the cultivation method (in terms of growth rate and product synthesis rate); (ii) harvesting and separation of the microalgal biomass from the culture medium; (iii) pre-treatment of the algal biomass to release its components (mainly lipids, proteins, carbohydrates) for further conversion; and (iv) the further conversion steps themselves.
Growth rate and productivity of microalgae are affected by a number of factors such as availability of nutrients in the right amounts and compositions, presence of actinomycetes or other fungi, pH, light intensity and temperature. Open pond systems have relatively low capital costs and high scalability but may feature uneven mixing and nutrition conditions and are vulnerable to contamination and intrusion of alien species. Photobioreactor and closed-loop systems allow to better control growth conditions, but on the other hand require higher capital costs as well as higher maintenance costs.
Harvesting of microalgae is challenging and expensive due to small cell size and relatively low concentration. Several pre-treatment methods are employed, depending on the feedstock and desired products (chemical, enzymatic, physical, involving ionic liquids). The wide variability of microalgal feedstock composition and optimal growth conditions means that there is no one-fits-all solution; cultivation, harvesting and processing must be tailored to each species and targeted product.
The specific challenge is to scale up and lower the costs of microalgae cultivation combined with downstream processing towards commercial valorisation of marketable products.
Scope:
Demonstrate the efficient and sustainable cultivation, recovery and processing of microalgae and downstream production of high-value chemicals and/or materials including food and feed ingredients.
The scope of this topic excludes energy carriers (such as liquid fuels or hydrogen) as the main products.
Proposals should aim for large-scale continuous cultivation and recovery of microalgae, as well as separation and purification of the targeted products.
Proposals should also aim at reducing inputs for microalgae cultivation such as energy, water, nutrients and CO2 (or other carbon sources in case heterotrophic microalgae are envisaged).
Proposals should valorise as many as possible of the valuable compounds contained in the microalgae through a cascading approach.
Proposals should demonstrate that the quality of the obtained products meets the requirements of specific market applications.
Proposals should address all requirements for IA - demonstration actions as shown in Table 3 in the Introduction of the Annual Work plan 2019.
The technology readiness level (TRL) at the end of the project should be 6-7. Proposals should clearly state the starting and end TRLs of the key technology or technologies targeted in the project.
Indicative funding:
It is considered that proposals requesting a maximum contribution of EUR 7 million would be able to address this specific challenge appropriately. However, this does not preclude the submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
The global consumption of textile fibres is increasing rapidly. This market has been growing with an annual rate of approximately 4%, reaching around 103 Mt in 20171. Synthetic and traditional natural bio-based fibres like cotton cannot meet the increasing demand in a context of limited resources. The production capacity of cotton, for example, is limited by sustainability constraints linked to resources consumption (land, water, fertilisers, pesticides, etc.).
Concurrently, consumers are increasingly demanding sustainable high-quality textiles: from renewable feedstock, sustainably produced, and with clear end-of-life qualities to support a circular economy. Innovative bio-based yarns and textiles can enter and compete in the established textile markets by meeting all of consumers’ evolving sustainability requirements, combined with performance levels that exceed the state of the art.
In the same context, also bio-based additives for textiles have the potential to guarantee environmental sustainability while providing specific technical properties to meet consumers’ demand. Moreover, bio-based functional molecules can represent valuable, non-hazardous alternatives for fossil-based additives currently used in textile applications.
The new bio-based fibres, as well as improved or tailor-made bio-based additives, can, for example, provide better mechanical or physical properties than the existing fibres in specific applications.
The specific challenge is to meet market requirements for new textile products outperforming the state of the art in terms of technical properties and sustainability aspects.

Scope:
Develop innovative bio-based fibres and/or bio-based additives for textile applications that outperform conventional (synthetic or natural) counterparts in terms of both technical and sustainability performance.
Proposals may address either bio-based fibres or bio-based additives, or both.
This topic excludes the use ‘as such’ of fibres and materials that already have a significant use in Europe. If proposals aim at these high-volume fibres and materials, the focus must be on innovative components (such as new bio-based additives) or treatments to improve their properties.
Proposals should target the fibre composition and its performance in specific applications, and/or functional molecules to improve the properties of specific textile products in identified applications. These functional bio-based molecules/additives can include colourants, flame retardants, water or gas proofing agents, UV and heat stability agents, fillers, photo- or thermo-reacting molecules, hydrophobic or hydrophilic agents, biocides, etc.
This topic includes any bio-based feedstock, provided it can be sourced in a way that is sustainable both from an environmental and an economic perspective.
Proposals should target mild operating conditions and resource-efficient processes to add sustainable processing steps to a value chain.
Proposals that focus on yarns should deliver new yarns that are compatible with conventional textile machinery.
Proposals should include an experimental validation of the proposed concept via direct comparison with existing comparable options.
Proposals should involve consumers, designers, trend influencers and/or specific end-user organisations to identify requested and feasible performance requirements in for example clothing, technical textiles and geotextiles.
Proposals should address all requirements for RIA as shown in Table 3 in the Introduction of the Annual Work plan 2019.
The technology readiness level (TRL) at the end of the project should be 4-5 for the bio-based value chain in question. Proposals should clearly state the starting and end TRLs of the key technology or technologies targeted in the project.
Industry participation in the project would be considered as an added value because it can play a supportive role to demonstrate the potential for integrating the developed concepts and technologies into current industrial landscapes or existing plants so they can be deployed more quickly and scaled up to apply industry-wide.

Sustainability assessments are major factors not only for consumer acceptance but also for developing an efficient and meaningful policy framework for bio-based products. While there is already a framework in place for the sustainability assessment of biomass and biofuels, there are only incipient initiatives for bio-based products. Objective and quality life cycle assessments based on robust and agreed methods are important to clarify the environmental impact/benefits of bio-based products and to benchmark their environmental performance with alternative non-bio-based products on the market.
Scope:
The proposals will develop sustainability schemes for bio-based products building on (1) existing schemes for biomass and bioenergy, including biofuels, (2) the work of (CEN-TC411) on standards for ‘Bio-based Products – Sustainability Criteria’ and ‘Bio-based Products – Life Cycle Assessment' which should incorporate end of life, (3) previous work on bio-based products LCA methods for bio-based products. Aspects that could be considered include: building-in economic and social factors; thresholds for different sustainability criteria/indicators; certification schemes and use of standards; life cycle assessment of bio-based products; (eco)labelling; aspects of the circular economy, resource efficiency and the principle of cascade use considering existing criteria for bioenergy product sustainability; the development of ILUC factors for bio-based products taking into account existing approaches to ILUC for bioenergy. The applicability and efficiency of the proposed sustainability schemes and criteria/indicators in the current regulatory framework; the balance between costs and complexity of the sustainability assessment; and the market pull the specific proposed measures will represent, should be presented as credible cases in the proposal. In this context applicants may decide to focus making the case for specific segment/groups of bio-based products, which should be of course justified.

Expected Impact:
To contribute to the implementation of the objectives of relevant European policy initiatives, including the Lead Market Initiative in Bio-based Products, the Industrial Policy with its instruments such as the European Innovation Partnership on Raw Materials, the Environmental Technology Action Plan and the Bioeconomy Strategy, proposals will have to:
Contribute to the development of efficient, implementable and fit-for-purpose sustainability schemes and criteria and indicators;

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Production of bio-based products (like chemicals or proteins) requires affordable high quality feedstock, industrial stable conversion and sufficiently high purity levels of product streams and yields to permit further downstream conversion steps. There are still various possibilities to optimise bio-based production routes not fully applied in the bioeconomy, i.e. minimising feedstock or nutrient losses over the whole process chain that are caused by either processing or partial use of the feedstock. The challenge is to find industrial viable solutions for the processes and reduce environmental footprints (such as CO2-emissions) via optimisation of bio-based production routes.
The challenge is to specifically optimise technical bio-based production routes in a way that minimizes nutrient losses over the whole process chain caused by either processing and/or partial use of various feedstock. Solutions may include use of agricultural side streams as substrates, optimized process options with matched fermentation organisms or new solutions regarding nutrient management.
Scope:
Demonstrate the techno-economic viability of the production of cost-competitive bio-based products, in both upstream and downstream steps versus traditional processes (state-of-the-art).
In bio-catalytic processes, these could include optimising process options like optimised and/or matched fermentation organisms, feeding strategies or nutrient management;
In chemo-catalytic processes, these could include optimising processes to produce di-carboxylic acids and/or diols at high purity levels and high product yields.
Proposals should show the sustainability of the value chain, including the required feedstock for the production process, and the potential market uptake of the products for specific applications. Proposals should show efficient feedstock provision to secure supply, and identify actors in the end-user markets for the intended market applications.
Proposals should clearly show the improvements in ecology and economy of the total biorefining operation, yielding high-value bio-based products.
Safety, quality and purity of the bio-based products must be in line with commercial and/or regulatory requirements by actively building upon existing knowledge and standards.
Proposals should achieve technology demonstrated in an industrial environment, or a system prototype demonstration in operational environment. Proposals need to address the whole value chain, from feedstock sourcing to market applications (Technology Readiness Levels 6-7).
Proposals should also include a Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) in order to evaluate the environmental and socio-economic performance of the whole value chain.
It is considered that proposals with a total eligible budget of up to EUR 15 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals with another budget.
Expected Impact:
When addressing bio-catalytic or chemical processes:
Increased yield of targeted bio-based product(s) by more than 20%, compared to state-of-the-art processes.
Reduced production costs of bio-based products by 10-20%, compared to current market situation.
Reduction of energy consumption by more than 30% for bio-catalytic processes and by more than 20% for chemical processes, as compared to state-of-the-art production processes.
Savings in terms of CO2-emissions per kg product by more than 20% for bio-catalytic processes and by more than 30% for chemical processes, as compared to state-of-the-art production routes for di-carboxylic acids or bio-based diols.
Projects under this topic should result in 1 new building block based on biomass of European origin validated at demonstration scale (KPI 4) and at least 2 new bio-based materials (KPI 5).

","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Effectively operating bio-based industries encompass a wide range of actors and stakeholders spread across several economic and industrial sectors and geographic locations. Each one of them has to-date traditionally been part of a well-defined value chain. This paradigm is undergoing major changes to incorporate the rise of new valorisation routes for bio-based feedstock.
In the new bioeconomy, actors in bio-based industries integrate in ‘cross-sectorial’ partnerships within their traditional value chains, and develop new value chains that lapse across the traditional ones. One significant result hereof is that intermediate ‘by-product’, ‘waste’ and 'residue' streams from separate value chains can be utilised as feedstock in other value chains through biorefining. This will imply an integrated biorefinery approach and establish a circular bioeconomy.
In addition, actors in bio-based industries have developed new schemes for cascading exploitation of biomass in order to maximise the efficient use of resources and the value of products. The challenge is to establish new industrial value chains across the EU (for example, based on industrial side-streams including those of food industry, urban bio-waste or aquatic biomass, etc.), crossing boundaries of traditional sectors and value chains as well as enhancing the exploitation of local resources. This will encompass the interaction across sectors with different expertise and new different business and cooperation models. With this approach technical hurdles will be overcome through cooperation between the industrial sectors and innovative technology developers; all actors also need to combine forces to address non-technological hurdles (for example related to policies).
Clusters, being networks of cities/local authorities, waste operators, biomass producers (forest, agriculture), and regions across Member States, are instrumental to develop new value chains and support the development of new processes and materials.
Scope:
Establish cooperation and integration across sectors, value chains and geographical borders to develop new bio-based value chains and facilitate market uptake.
Proposals should target actions on overcoming the existing sectorial thinking and proactively build bridges between different sectors and industries across Europe. Cooperating across boundaries of sectors, value chains and countries will exploit opportunities for symbiosis, synergies and complementarity in expertise and infrastructure.
Proposals should coordinate with on-going projects and activities that address bioeconomy regional strategies. For instance, the smart specialisation strategies, as coordination principle, could build more critical mass in the value chains valorising local resources.
The focus should be on the identification and establishment of concrete new networks resulting in new value chains involving the relevant actors. Proposals should also link to Horizon 2020 and EU initiatives that address similar needs. These are for example the European Innovation Partnerships (EIPs) ‘Agricultural Productivity and Sustainability’, ‘Raw Materials’ and ‘Water Efficiency’.
Proposals should address the following elements:
Linking producers of biomass, including ‘alternative’ biomass such as algae and other aquatic and terrestrial biomass, residues from food crops, agriculture and forest activities and bio-waste in general, with other stakeholders such as waste management operators, state and local administrations, to actors in biorefining and users of bio-based products.
Establishing new clusters and networks of local authorities and stakeholders in the bio-based industries aiming at building new value chains that lapse across traditional value ones.
Expanding the cooperation between existing (biorefinery) clusters across Europe to exploit opportunities for symbiosis, synergies and complementarity in expertise and infrastructure.
Maximising the use of technologies for information exchange and knowledge transfer between actors in the value chains at a European level.
The Bio-based Industries Consortium (BIC) will set up an industry expert group from among its members which will provide expertise in the implementation and follow-up of the different tasks and also provide support to the organisation of meetings or workshops. This expert group should be a central part of the governance structure of the project.
Expected Impact:
New synergies among activities between the primary sector (agriculture, forestry, aquatic, etc.) and industries with biological waste and residues streams from processes, and the bio-based industries (KPI 1 and KPI 3).
Concrete initiatives to identify and create new networks resulting in new bio-based value chains involving the relevant actors from different industrial sectors.
Demonstrated more intense and specific knowledge transfer among industrial partners and other stakeholders in the bioeconomy.
New clusters of bio-based knowledge and expertise across the EU, fostering the competitiveness of the European bioeconomy.

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Livestock feed production is the single largest land user in the world. The rapidly growing world population and increasingly demanding consumers are causing a huge rise in the demand for meat. This causes the necessity to identify alternative protein sources to ensure a more sustainable supply of proteins for animal feed. Research has identified several feedstock families as potential sources. These include low value biorefinery side-streams, residues from the agro-food industry (fruit, vegetables, cereals side-streams), seaweeds and algae or dry land crops.
The challenge is to demonstrate the sustainability and efficiency of the identified new protein sources at sufficiently large scale to meet market demands.
Scope:
Demonstrate the techno-economic viability of the sustainable, cost-efficient and consistent conversion and upgrading of industry side-streams via biorefinery into suitable quality protein products, ensuring consistent end-product quality and quantity.
Proposals should cover the whole value chain, from identification and characterisation of available feedstock, to development of a process capable of ensuring acceptable efficiency and suitable quality and quantity levels of the targeted products. In particular, proposals should involve biomass suppliers as well as breeders and farmers in order to ensure the sustainability and feasibility of the developed value chain.
Proposals must validate safety, quality and purity of the products in order to meet commercial and/or regulatory requirements. Proteins and nutrients obtained should be comparable and competitive with those from the conventional sources of proteins used for animal feed (such as plants and crops).
A Life Cycle Assessment should be part of the proposal in order to evaluate the environmental and socio-economic performance of the whole value chain.
Proposals should achieve technology demonstrated in an industrial environment, or system prototype demonstration in operational environment (Technology Readiness Levels 6-7) of the whole value chain, from feedstock identification and supply through the identified suitable processing steps into the targeted protein products, and their utilisation in animal feed. Proposals for the conversion and upgrading steps therefore include the involvement of relevant actors in the feedstock supply sector as well as in the animal feed market sector.
Proposals should also include a Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) in order to evaluate the environmental and socio-economic performance of the whole value chain.
It is considered that proposals with a total eligible budget of up to EUR 15 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals with another budget.
Expected Impact:
In the case of the agro-food industry side-streams, demonstrated increase of income for farmers and breeders as a result of the exploitation of residues.
Demonstrated savings in terms of water and fertilisers consumption as well as of land use in comparison with the current animal feed production.
Proven cost-efficient value chain and economically attractive proteins production at industrial scale facilitating market acceptance and uptake of the developed products (such as proteins, nutrients).
Projects under this topic should result in 1 new building block based on biomass of European origin validated at demonstration scale (KPI 4) and/or at least 1 new bio-based material (KPI 5).

","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
The demand for forest-based biomass for various applications is increasing. The markets of forest-based products are very competitive, with other regions (namely North and South America) leading in production efficiency. The European forest-based sector could improve its competitiveness by increasing the sustainable mobilisation of forest resources through better forest infrastructure, suitable machinery, consolidated ownerships and better management of undeveloped wood markets. Also, Europe needs a continued maintenance of forests, which yields benefits in terms of prevention of landslides, improved fire risk management, higher carbon capture by trees and other ecosystem services. A sustainable increase of the productivity of its forests will increase the value of forest land itself.
The need to increase the resilience of forests to climate change is a common issue all over Europe where rising temperatures and changing rainfall patterns are projected to affect the composition of forests. The change in forest composition also bears consequences on the local ecosystem and biodiversity, as well as on the role of forests as carbon sinks.
Increasing forest mobilisation and adapt forests to climate changes are crucial to avoid their degradation and to harness possible changes in their composition and vertical structure. These are needed to retain their economic value and to maintain the sustainability of value chains based on forest-based biomass. Furthermore, increasing the resource, energy and process efficiency of wood processing within forest-based sectors, could enlarge the suitability of the various kinds of forest biomass with a wider range of marketable products.
Scope:
Building on ongoing activities in the field of adapting forests to projected changes in climate, proposals need to demonstrate the techno-economic viability in forest-based value chains of breeding of varieties of current tree species as well as prospecting for new ones. This will require the plantation of several hectares of land. Proposals could also address the composition of forests by creating mixed forests with the introduction of allogeneic species. Forest owners should be involved in proposals.
Proposals should demonstrate the whole value chain based on the innovations introduced. Specifically, by introducing new tree varieties, the validation should show the economic benefits of increased sustainability and the suitability of the new forest-based biomass for downstream processing. The latter should ideally lead to the development of new products with higher added-value than existing comparable products. The associated business model should include the upscaling of the selected approach to commercial levels.
Proposals should assess the impact of the proposed forest management innovations on the ecosystem, ensuring that the local biodiversity are not disturbed and the protection role of forests maintained as well.
Proposals should include field validation of the proposed approach on a representative surface (several hectares). Proposals should build on proven achievements at lab or pilot scale. Proposals should seek complementarity to the projects funded under topic H2020 SPIRE-03-2016 and BB-03-07 to avoid overlaps and promote synergies.
Proposals should achieve technology demonstrated in an industrial environment, or a system prototype demonstration in operational environment. Proposals need to address the whole value chain, from feedstock sourcing to market applications (Technology Readiness Levels 6-7).
Proposals should also include a Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) in order to evaluate the environmental and socio-economic performance of the whole value chain.
It is considered that proposals with a total eligible budget of up to EUR 15 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals with another budget.
Expected Impact:
Increased forest wood biomass productivity per hectare by 20% or more.
Stabilisation of supply for woody raw material, hence helping retain the competitiveness of the European forest-based sector, while achieving higher income for forest owners due to increased wood productivity and improved mobilisation.
The result of projects under this topic should result in the demonstration of 1 new building block based on biomass of European origin validated at demonstration scale (KPI 4) and/or at least 1 new bio-based material (KPI 5).

","15 October 2015
","29 September 2016","Specific Challenge:
It is expected that automated vehicles at automation level 3 (Conditional Automation) will enter the market by 2020 to 2025. In the past years, there have been significant efforts in research to develop the technologies for vehicles and infrastructure to enable automated driving functions. However, substantial challenges remain on the path to a European wide deployment. There is a great need to demonstrate the technological readiness, reliability and safety of the automated driving functions in a large scale pilot at European scale. Before the market introduction, it is important to test automated cars in mixed traffic situations, analyse the interaction between the driver, the cars and the traffic environment, study the behaviour of other traffic participants and get an insight into automated driving under different conditions (e.g. traffic intensity, weather, lighting, etc.). In addition these pilots should assess the viability of different business models to ensure investments are done by those benefiting the most. For implementing large scale testing, Member States may need to adapt their regulatory framework and solve liability issues in case of accidents with automated vehicles.
Scope:
The action will integrate and test enabling technologies for automation level 3 (Conditional Automation) and evaluate the benefits in Field Operational Tests (FOTs) for passenger cars. Possible additional functions towards level 4 (High Automation) can also be tested, although the focus of the FOT should be on technologies for automation level 3. This needs the active involvement of all stakeholders such as car manufacturers, automotive suppliers, road users, insurance companies, road and traffic authorities, the EU Member States, etc., because the responsibility and liability of all stakeholders relating to the testing, demonstrating and use of automated cars requires clarification before market introduction. The FOTs should take place in at least 3 different countries. Automation pilots for all driving situations (i.e. from highway to urban) are within scope. If proposals include FOTs on highways, testing across borders should be considered. Consortia should commit to make the data collected during the pilots available through common data sharing frameworks in order to foster further research.
The automation pilots should consider all the following aspects:
―Demonstrate the robustness and reliability (functional safety) of technologies, systems and functions needed to support the gradual progress towards full automation, in particular from level 2 – Partial Automation (human driver monitors the driving environment) to level 3 (Conditional Automation) including possible additional functions towards level 4 (High Automation).
―Evaluate effects of automated driving systems (e.g. on traffic flow, communication, etc.) in a mixed traffic environment with automated and non-automated vehicles and under different conditions (e.g. traffic intensity, weather, lighting, etc.).
―Analyse user acceptance and behaviour; study interaction between the driver, the vehicles and the traffic environment and behaviour of other traffic participants.
―Focus on the in-vehicle evaluation of the driver under real traffic conditions in particular during the transition of control from the vehicle system to the driver and vice versa, e.g. expectations, adoption, acceptance, trust, usability driver position; human-vehicle interaction, monitoring strategies; investigate intended and unintended use of the system and possible mitigation solutions; evaluate fail operational solutions (e.g. emergency stop). Gender balanced representation of the reference group should be ensured and data analysed in a disaggregated way.
―Conduct impact assessment (e.g. safety, energy use, pollutant emissions, traffic congestion, mobility behaviour, social inclusion, use of transport services, etc.) on real world data sets.
―Establish a pan-European common catalogue on necessary characteristics of cooperative decision, planning and control algorithms, including self-adaptation and learning features and ethical questions.
―Fulfil all security requirements to protect the system to any threats and avoid any conscious manipulations of the information enabling automated driving systems.
Proposed actions may consider C-ITS communication and European GNSS as a possibility to improve the safety and reliability of automated transport systems in the future.
The size of proposals will depend on the geographical coverage of the large scale demonstrations.
Consideration should be taken of gender aspects and other demographic factors such as ageing, etc.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 18 to 36 million each would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
Actions are expected to demonstrate the technological readiness, reliability and safety of the automated driving functions in a large scale pilot at European scale. They will test automated vehicles at automation level 3 (including possible additional functions towards automation level 4) in mixed traffic situations. Actions are expected to demonstrate that automated driving systems for passenger vehicles can contribute to increase road safety and transport efficiency, reduce energy use, pollutant emissions and traffic congestions, and therefore support climate action and sustainable development objectives. This action will provide significant contributions in the following areas:
―User acceptance and the interaction between the driver, the vehicles and the traffic environment (including other road users) in different real traffic conditions.
―Wider socio-economic impacts of automated driving and the benefits for the driver in terms of mobility, comfort, convenience and safety and analyse specific issues related to gender and other demographic factors such as ageing, etc.
―Uptake of new automated transport business models.
―Benefits resulting from the interaction between automated driving technologies and V2X communication (connected driving).

The bioeconomy is not a well-known concept among European citizens due to lack of information or information that cannot be understood by the general public. This means that there is little awareness of the importance of the bioeconomy in times of climate change, food insecurity and the tangible benefits the use of biological resources can bring to our everyday life. There is a strong need identified to engage in structured and coherent communication activities on the bioeconomy research and innovation results. The main tasks of this project are therefore to better understand existing barriers, raise awareness by informing citizens and establish an interactive, two way dialogue between local research centres, the European Commission and European citizens.
Scope:
Proposals under this action should bring bioeconomy research and innovation closer to the EU citizens to show the potential economic, environmental and social impact of the bioeconomy. A series of communication activities around Europe at local level (for example in the form of bioeconomy roadshows and online campaigns) would contribute to address this challenge. Showcasing examples of bioeconomy products, demonstrating the relevance and possibilities of bioeconomy in everyday life and spread targeted information in local languages in big cities around Europe can be considered as means to bring the bioeconomy closer to a wider audience (for example to the younger generation).
The proposals may consider the involvement of local and regional authorities, and reaching out through opinion leaders as bioeconomy ambassadors could multiply these messages and be perceived by the public as source of local, credible and accessible information.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of an indicative amount of EUR 2 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
In the framework of the EU Bioeconomy Strategy, this action should initiate structured and consistent communication on the bioeconomy across a range of on- and offline platforms with a view to boosting knowledge of the general European public. The following impacts can be expected:
Citizens will become aware of the importance and possibilities/impact that research and innovation in the bioeconomy can offer for them
Bioeconomy will be put more prominent on the agenda at national, local and regional levels

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
High costs of feedstock and energy in the EU require biorefineries to apply highly efficient processes to remain competitive. These include processes to handle and convert by- and co-products from different industrial and commercial activities. And they also include integrating own biorefining operations and maximising the use of intermediate- and side-streams, through recycling or next steps processing.
The predominant component of side-streams from lignocellulosic biomass processing is lignin. Other co-products may vary in content according to the plant: crystalline cellulose, complex polymers and dead cells have also high content in streams from the fermentation stage in biorefineries; while soaps, terpenes and sulphur compounds are found in pulp mills’ black liquor (besides lignin). All these components represent, in various degrees, also potential sources of new feedstock for further valorisation.
At lab and small pilot scale, there are many examples of valorisation of lignin-rich streams.
The challenge is to demonstrate at a larger scale the feasibility and sustainability of valorisation of lignin-rich streams at the core of a full value chain in order to set the basis for a future market deployment of the obtained products.
Scope:
Demonstrate the techno-economic viability of the efficient valorisation of lignin-rich side-streams from biorefineries or from black liquor streams from the pulp and paper industries. Besides lignin, other streams – such as crystalline cellulose, complex polymers and dead cells from the different stages of biorefineries and soaps, terpenes and sulphur compounds from pulp and paper mills – could be addressed.
In particular, applying the 'cascading use principle[1]' (valorisation of the side-streams) where possible, aiming at realising an integrated, zero-waste biorefinery operation by maximising conversion of different streams available and of the corresponding different materials and compounds. This includes the recovery and recycling of process chemicals, obviating or minimising the need for new input thereof.
Proposals should encompass the whole value chain, proving innovative and efficient technologies and methods to improve sustainability. Proposals should also demonstrate replicability of the developed processes to different side-streams.
Proposals should also include regulatory aspects and the market pull of the targeted chemicals and material, in order to match legislation requirements and those by costumers and end-users, with technical, environmental and economic aspects linked to the bio-based value chain. These aspects include safety, quality and purity of the products by actively building upon existing knowledge and standardisation activities.
Proposals should achieve technology demonstrated in an industrial environment, or a system prototype demonstration in operational environment. Proposals need to address the whole value chain, from feedstock sourcing to market applications (Technology Readiness Levels 6-7).
Proposals should also include a Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) in order to evaluate the environmental and socio-economic performance of the whole value chain.
It is considered that proposals with a total eligible budget of up to EUR 15 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals with another budget.

The focus of this topic is to develop, test and validate platooning concepts, technologies and functionalities and to demonstrate the robustness of multi-brand platooning using C-ITS communication on a real corridor use case (which preferably goes across national borders). The proposed actions should include all the following aspects:
―Solutions to ensure robustness, reliability and interoperability of the platoon operation in real road conditions.
―Automated mechanisms to support transition from single automated vehicles to platoons.
―Supporting models for forming and dissolution of platoons (with different vehicles from different manufacturers).
―Analysis of different platooning strategies (incl. logistical optimisation) to achieve good cost-benefits.
―Integration with intelligent traffic and logistical information systems.
―Suitable lane assignment strategies for platoons.
―Design of road interfaces between corridors for platooning and non-adapted roads and optimisation of road infrastructure to optimally support platooning (technical, capacity, management).
―Analysis of road users’ perceptions of and behavioural reactions to platoons and their behaviour, impact of road trains on traffic and transport infrastructure, legal/regulatory challenges and standards.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 15 to 20 million each would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
Actions are expected to address the challenges that remain on the path to a Europe wide deployment of platooning with different types of vehicles in real, mixed traffic conditions. They will seek to demonstrate the feasibility of robust, reliable and interoperable multi-brand platooning systems on a real corridor use case. Actions will show that multi-brand platooning will help to increase energy efficiency of heavy duty traffic in platoons by about 15%, improve traffic management due to more efficient utilisation of road capacity, as well as: safety of heavy duty vehicles in mixed traffic. Therefore, actions will contribute to the development of modern, more efficient transport systems, with reduced impacts on climate change, air pollution, noise, health and accidents. Actions will also seek to reach a total cost reduction of logistics and supply chain leading to improved competitiveness of the EU in general and contribute to increased competitiveness of European Original Equipment Manufacturers and supply industry.
Actions will provide significant contributions in the following areas:
―Analyse impacts of platooning on traffic.
―Study perception and behaviour of other road users in presence of road trains and automated heavy duty vehicles, for instance at motorway exits.
―Analyse requirements with regard to infrastructure to optimally support platooning, logistics, data exchange, sharing of cost savings.
―Understand innovative business cases for operators (for example due to the impact on driving time and rest periods of drivers).

","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Residual streams from aquaculture, fisheries and the aquatic processing industries contain a varied mixture of bone, cartilage, skin and shells, liquid streams and other material. Some is processed into animal feed or fertilisers, but a large proportion is treated as waste, despite containing interesting molecules for cosmetics, nutraceutical and pharmaceutical applications, among others. Moreover, associated disposal costs are high.
Handling bycatch and residual streams at high seas, and storing and transporting them to land for valorisation into compounds for value-added applications, present many challenges. This sea-land connection needs to consist of sustainable steps to build value chains through market applications.
On land, further development and testing of (bio)technological processes is needed to efficiently convert the residual streams from aquaculture, fisheries and the aquatic processing industries before upscaling towards further valorisation steps. The initial stages of the valorisation processes must identify and specify the potential of the different types of these residual streams to obtain sufficient compounds for next steps towards value-added applications.
The specific challenge for this topic is to resolve the logistical, infrastructural and technological challenges to efficiently deliver residual and side streams from the aquaculture, fisheries and the aquatic processing industries to biorefining operations.
Scope:
Develop and test an efficient and sustainable supply system for residual and side streams from aquaculture, fisheries and the aquatic processing industries to the bio-based industry for valorisation into more commercially viable applications.
Proposals should address the elimination of hurdles and bottlenecks regarding the logistics, transport modes and associated infrastructure in the targeted biomass feedstock supply systems. These include collection systems, intermediate storage and safety aspects (see introduction – section 2.2.5 - published in the BBI JU AWP 2018).
Proposals should test the different biomass types by applying existing quality parameters and/or standards and by generating novel ones if needed.
Proposals should focus on selecting, extracting or producing specific compounds from these residual streams into products for further applications in the chemistry, pharmaceuticals, cosmetics and human or animal nutrition. Proposals may address more than one feedstock and production chain.
This topic excludes biomass from the agricultural and forestry sectors. It focuses on biomass other than algae (both micro and macro) and covers both fresh water and marine sources.
Proposals should include steps through the selection, extraction or production of at least two compounds with potential for further valorisation into market applications.
The industry should actively participate to demonstrate the potential for integrating the developed concepts into current industrial landscapes or existing plants so that the concepts can be deployed more quickly and scaled up to apply industrial-wide.
Proposals should specifically demonstrate the benefits versus the state-of-the-art and existing technologies. This could be done by providing evidence of new processing solutions and new products obtained.
Proposals should commit to assessing the environmental and economic impacts of the developed products or processes, using LCA methodologies based on available standards, certification, accepted and validated approaches (see introduction – section 2.2.5 - published in the BBI JU AWP 2018)1.
Proposals should also include an economic viability performance check (value chain and market analysis) of the developed products and processes, along with an analysis of social impacts where applicable.
If relevant, proposals should also allow for pre- and co-normative research necessary for developing the needed product quality standards.
The technology readiness level (TRL)2 at the end of the project should be 4-5. Proposals should clearly state the starting TRL.
Indicative funding:
It is considered that proposals requesting a contribution of between EUR 2 million and EUR 5 million would be able to address this specific challenge appropriately. However, this does not preclude the submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
1 The LCA may focus on a set of critical issues early on to steer the development process in the right direction. In this case, it is essential that this selection is carefully explained in the proposal in order to allow for expert assessment. See also in the introduction.

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Currently, most of the packaging used in a wide variety of applications in different market sectors – including food, pharmaceuticals and clothing – is not recyclable. It consists mostly of multi-layer packaging, with each layer composed of different polymers that perform specific functions, making it technically non-recyclable. The end-of-life phase for this packaging, therefore, is either incineration or landfill.
Moreover, the compostable bio-based packaging that is currently available mainly ends up in industrial composting facilities. This is because other biological waste treatment processes like anaerobic digestion and home composters are generally not suitable for most of the current compostable polymers.
Novel alternative solutions should ‘eco-design’ packaging products to avoid the incineration and landfill routes at their end-of-life phase, rerouting them instead towards approved and accepted applications, where they can add value without adding an environmental burden.
The specific challenge of this topic is to make the end-of-life phase for packaging significantly more sustainable.
Scope:
Design new processing systems for functional bio-based packaging products that are reusable, recyclable, and/or compostable and biodegradable, as an alternative to the current identified benchmark products.
Proposals should address the production process, including the necessary improvements to lamination and coating steps to obtain the target end-products and their specifications.
Proposals should prove that the target packaging products are recyclable or compostable/ biodegradable in various environments to reduce their overall environmental footprint. This will make their production and use more circular.
The scope also includes multi-layer products. In that case, proposals should consider the feasibility of producing multi-layer/single-polymer solutions, instead of multi-layer/multi-polymer solutions, provided they meet all required functionalities and outperform state-of-the-art alternatives for sustainability.
Along with the environmental sustainability of the developed solutions, other factors – such as innovation in functionality and production – are considered an asset for the proposals. Any potential hazards associated with the developed processes and products should be analysed to ensure that the products comply fully with REACH1 legislation and other toxicity requirements, safety requirements and any relevant EU legislation.
The industry should actively participate to demonstrate the potential for integrating the developed concepts into current industrial landscapes or existing plants so that the concepts can be deployed more quickly and scaled up to apply industrial-wide.
Proposals should specifically demonstrate the benefits versus the state-of-the-art and existing technologies. This could be done by providing evidence of new processing solutions and new products obtained. This step will need to involve consumer organisations, together with recyclers and composting plant representatives.
Proposals should commit to assessing the environmental impacts of the developed processes or products using LCA methodologies based on available standards, certification, accepted and validated approaches (see introduction – section 2.2.5 - published in the BBI JU AWP 2018)2.

Research and demonstration activities have applied innovative technologies and processes to obtain novel bio-based building blocks, polymers and materials with improved functionalities and performances for packaging, coatings, resins and paints, additives, composites, fibres, cosmetics and others.
These innovative products can outperform state-of-the-art products, both fossil-based and current bio-based in comparable applications, in terms of performance and sustainability. However, despite their better performance and the high interest from the market in benefiting from this, their higher production costs and consequent higher prices slow down market uptake.
The specific challenge of this topic is to realise the high market potential of innovative bio-based building blocks, polymers and materials at a competitive level with benchmark products.

Produce, at commercial level, bio-based building blocks, polymers and materials that outperform existing alternatives in comparable applications on performance and sustainability, by scaling up an optimised value chain, with demonstrated technologies and systems in an operational environment.
This topic builds on a successful demonstration of an optimised value chain at TRL 6-7, producing building blocks, polymers and materials with the potential to scale up. Proposals can also exploit natural bio-polymers where feasible.
Proposals should deliver a first-of-a-kind biorefinery, fully integrating feedstock supply and processing technologies to deliver products with target functionalities to meet identified market demand at competitive prices. The biorefinery should demonstrate effective and cost-efficient operation at a commercial level, applying where relevant the cascading use of biomass to maximise resource efficiency.
This topic includes any biomass feedstock that can be supplied sustainably to a large-scale biorefinery while providing economic, social and environmental benefits along the supply chain.
This topic may include any processing technology that has been demonstrated in an optimised value chain, and should encompass all processing stages leading to intermediate and end-products.

Crossing the boundaries between existing and new industrial sectors and involving partners in a variety of fields entails working in areas where different academic disciplines cross paths and in diverse teams to speed up innovation. Adequately skilled people will be needed to operate innovative value chains while establishing and sustaining a bio-based industry in Europe. The bio-based industry is looking to forge a true partnership with academia that delivers the right skills for the 21st century. This partnership should also raise the profile of career opportunities in the bio-based industry and related academic fields.
In recent years a number of sectors have carried out many activities and programmes to address a rising skills mismatch and prevent a widening skills gap in the future. These programmes are running at the regional, national and European levels1. The bio-based industry does not have such programmes at European level. As the bio-based sector is expected to bring growth and jobs, particularly in rural and coastal areas, it could play a significant role in tackling unemployment in areas such as southern Europe, where youth unemployment is high2. Often this may require retraining to provide the skills needed.
The specific challenge of this topic is to identify education needs and gaps in Europe’s bio-based sector and point to career opportunities in research and the industry.
1 See, for example, the European Commission’s New Skills Agenda for Europe. The 2017 blueprint includes six pilot sectors: automotive; defence; maritime technology; space (geo information); textile, leather, clothing and footwear; and tourism. The pulp and paper sector is a candidate for the second round.

Scope:
Identify opportunities and gaps to promote careers in the bio-based industry, education and research (applied and fundamental) at regional, national and European level, building upon earlier activities.
Proposals must be the collective result of cooperation bringing together industry actors, both large and small, and educational and research institutions and associations, including technical colleges. The objective is to further align education and research to provide the skilled people needed to build a sustainable bio-based industry in Europe.
A broader approach, including a vision for reaching young students in the early stages of the educational system as well as specialists already working in the industry, each with appropriate approaches, will be an asset to the proposal.
Proposals should be based on an overview of new and ongoing programmes at the national, regional, European and key international levels that address bio-based activities and the bioeconomy so as to avoid overlaps, utilise results and lessons learned where applicable, and build on strengths at European level.
The Bio-based Industries Consortium (BIC) will set up an industry expert group from among its members to provide expertise in the implementation and follow-up of the different tasks and help organise meetings. This expert group should have an advisory role in the project, but as such is not a beneficiary in the consortium.

Since citizens are the end-consumers of bio-based products and services, they should have the opportunity to provide direct input into the design and implementation of the bio-based economy. This engagement should in particular play a role in the current period of change which may eventually result in people moving out of their comfort zone. Moving away from traditional and familiar products and services to different or new products and services that are bio-based or contain bio-based components may not be easy. The bio-based industry faces the challenge to fit the results of its value chains to the needs of civil society. The most efficient way to achieve this is to involve the public and provide them with opportunities to give input into the bio-based agenda. This opportunity expands the ‘triple helix’ of university, industry and government organisations to also include civil society organisations, and is a significant part of ‘open science’.
Digitalisation offers these opportunities. Developments in information and communications technology (ICT) make it possible to share information and data that can be of significant value when designing the bio-based agenda and implementing it in society. Many citizens are already using their mobile phones to record and transmit events in their daily lives and surroundings1,2,3 , connecting actors in these networks. Increasingly, people are willing and motivated to participate in programmes that can improve their lives, those of others and the quality of the world they live in. Similarly, citizens may want to participate in providing input and monitoring implementation of the bio-based economy.
The specific challenge is to design the appropriate tools and system to empower citizens to participate in the bio-based economy.

3Rebuilding Ireland: https://vacanthomes.ie
Scope:
Identify possible systems to enable citizens to provide input into the agendas of the bio-based industry. The information could range from suggestions on designing and making bio-based products and applications for specific services to reporting the actual market performance of these products. The information could also be about situations that citizens believe are bad for humans or the environment and could be improved by bio-based products or applications. This will enable citizens to help shape the bio-based economy from the ‘bottom-up’.
Proposals should seek to identify or design user-friendly and useable systems in a wide array of daily life activities, in surroundings ranging from the home, leisure and work, to travel, vacation, etc.
Proposals should also pursue possibilities offered by gamification in the bio-based economy.
Proposals should investigate possibilities to create a ‘citizen bio-based economy observatory’ that could collect the information and relay it to the bio-based industry and to policy makers. Proposals should seek complementarity with the Bioeconomy Knowledge Centre Activities operated by the European Commission Joint Research Centre.
The Bio-based Industries Consortium (BIC) will set up an industry and market expert group from among its members to provide expertise on the implementation and follow-up of the different tasks and help organise meetings. This expert group is not to be a part of the proposal, but will be offered to the project consortium to assist as needed. This expert group therefore should have an advisory role in the project but would not be a beneficiary in the consortium.

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Products derived from petrochemical feedstock have extensive downstream production routes, developed markets and an efficient infrastructure. Therefore, making the ‘same’ chemicals from biomass and ‘blending’ them into these existing value chains (known as ‘drop-in’ chemicals) is the quickest and most cost-effective way to implement bio-based value chains in the short term. However, there are some bio-based molecules without a ‘significant’ fossil counterpart1 that industry and researchers regard as promising in the medium to long term, due to their special functional properties or possible derivatives.
While the production processes for bio-based chemicals with no significant fossil-based counterpart could be made more economical and sustainable, there is yet no infrastructure for their further use, making them less attractive for now.
Some of these bio-based building blocks have direct applications, but they can also serve to produce a broad variety of other chemicals that can bring renewability and sustainability in many markets. Among these ‘primary’ renewables are levulinic acid and muconic acid. These are building blocks for a variety of applications ranging from polymers and plasticisers and other intermediate building blocks, to lubricants, hydraulic fluids, pharmaceuticals and cosmetics. Since these molecules are (relatively) new on the chemical market, their production has not yet benefited from economies of scale and do not have well-developed value chains.
Technically, the production of those primary bio-based chemicals is in many cases already at TRL 4-5, as are some of their ‘secondary’ follow-up products. Industry now needs to demonstrate production routes for these chemicals at TRL 6-7.
The specific challenge is to demonstrate the technology of breakthrough bio-based chemicals with no significant fossil-based counterpart in a full demo-plant and to demonstrate its potential in at least one application at pre-commercial level.
1 Molecules having no fossil-based production route, or whose fossil-based production route(s) – while technically possible – is not commercially pursued because of cost or sustainability issues.
Scope:
Demonstrate a production process for bio-based chemicals with no significant fossil-based counterparts, originating from sustainably sourced biomass of European origin and demonstrate one application in the market at pre-commercial level.
Proposals should demonstrate a production route for at least one bio-based chemical building block that does not have a ‘significant’ fossil-based counterpart and show its market potential by means of at least one application.
Biotechnological, thermo- and chemo-catalytic processes are within the scope of this topic. The processes should ensure techno-economic competitive routes. This will efficiently pave the way to a further scale-up of the developed process(es) to enable an expanding market entrance for products based on the breakthrough chemical.
Proposals should justify the selection of the targeted molecule(s) and validate the full value chain. Proposals should demonstrate that the resulting products have a high market pull and that the operation is economically and environmentally sustainable. Furthermore, proposals should provide appropriate business models. Proposals should also show the feasible, sustainable and economic supply of European biomass for these applications via the primary building block. Proposals should also deliver a preliminary economic feasibility study, providing the basis for upscaling the technology to commercial level.
The Technology Readiness Level (TRL)1 at the end of the project should be 6-72. Proposals should clearly state the starting and target TRLs. The proposed work should enable the technology to achieve the target TRL within the timeframe of the project.
Proposals should include an environmental and economic assessment using Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) methodologies. Proposals should also include a viability performance check of the developed process(es) based on available standards, certification, accepted and validated approaches, as well as measurement and testing approaches allowing for coming regulatory compliance checks.
Indicative funding: It is considered that proposals requesting a contribution of maximally EUR 7 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude the submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Wood-based materials find wide application in many market segments based on their macro-, micro- and nano-scale structures. Surface treatments, meaning altering the properties of the wood matrix at its skin or adding layers to it, are increasingly used to improve and expand the applicability of these materials. Equally important are treatments working on the whole volume of the material to improve bulk properties such as mechanical or thermal properties. The range of techniques used is huge.
Demand for treated wood-based material is increasing, stimulated by a widening of applications in practice. At the same time, market requirements are pushing towards improved performance, ecodesign principles and reusability/recyclability at end-of-life phase.
The specific challenge is to develop new treatment methods for wood-based materials that improve the technological performance of the end product as well as the environmental impact at its end of life.
Scope:
Develop novel surface or bulk treatment methods for wood-based materials while improving reusability or recyclability at their end of life and test their applications in selected market segments.
The sustainable sourcing and conversion of starting wood material need to be ensured. Treatments can address the surface or the bulk volume of the wood-based material and can include physical, chemical, thermal and enzymatic processes or a combination thereof to achieve the desired quality of the surface and the functionalities of the material as a whole.
The overall resource efficiency of the process and products should also be increased by extending the durability of the targeted wood-based materials to foster the contribution of the harvested wood products to the carbon sink.
End-of-life phase should be addressed, with preference for reusing or recycling the material after its service life has ended. Otherwise, the biodegradability of the material should be assessed by applying the criteria given in the introduction.
Proposals should address all requirements for RIA as shown in Table 3 of the Annual Work plan 2019.
The technology readiness level (TRL) at the end of the project should be 4-5 for the bio-based value chain in question. roposals should clearly state the starting and end TRLs of the key technology or technologies targeted in the project.
Industry participation in the project would be considered as an added value because it can play a supportive role to demonstrate the potential for integrating the developed concepts and technologies into current industrial landscapes or existing plants so they can be deployed more quickly and scaled up to apply industry-wide.

It is considered that proposals requesting a contribution of between EUR 2 million and EUR 5 million would be able to address this specific challenge appropriately. However, this does not preclude the submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.

Plant oils and fats are a promising feedstock for high-value products with new functionalities and properties for applications in food, personal care, cosmetics and in the chemical industry, among others. However, current processing conditions for refining the feedstock can cause undesired or toxic impurities and possibly also potentially carcinogenic compounds1 Also, current refining processes have either a high energy demand or result in high oil losses, while the side streams bring in low value.
The specific challenge is to refine plant oils and fats at milder conditions, with high yields and delivering safe, high quality products.

High-performance applications often demand stable materials that, for example, can withstand temperature variations or are resistant to salt or to degradation by enzymes. Moreover, society increasingly demands products and applications that are sustainable and that can improve the environment in their entire life cycle (during their use and at their end of life).
The demand for high-performing, safe and sustainable bio-based materials exists today in market sectors as diverse as cosmetics, personal care, home care, packaging, coatings, resins and paints, additives, fibres, insulation, automotive, construction and others. The requirements for their functional capabilities and end of life may, however, differ.
The specific challenge is to identify and make available high-performance bio-based products for market applications that demand specific performance in use and in the end-of-life phase.
Scope:
Develop bio-based products with high functional qualities for specific market applications that cannot be met by currently available fossil-based products and can improve the environment in their entire life cycle (in their use and in their end-of-life phase).
Proposals should include successful testing of the developed products to efficiently prove that they offer the required performance in the targeted application(s). To that end, the developed products’ end-users should be involved to accurately define the required performance and properties and the approaches to forced ageing tests.
While the functional (technical) requirements of the bio-based products are dictated by the end products, their required end-of-life qualities depend on the use of the end products and their potential risk of environmental burden.

","Bio-based Industries Innovation action - Demonstration
","11 April 2018
","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
The use of lignocellulosic feedstock to produce chemicals and materials for commercially viable applications usually focuses on valorising cellulose.
Current processes that use hydrolysis to convert carbohydrate chains into sugars mostly focus on glucose from cellulose for further processing, leaving the other sugars in hemicellulose unused. These include potentially valuable monomers such as xylose, mannose, galactose, arabinose and rhamnose. They could be used either directly, or fermented into compounds for high-value products. Valorising these co-products into specialty sugars or high-value products can significantly increase a biorefinery’s profitability.
Unlike first-generation sugars 1, the sugars derived from lignocellulosic feedstock often suffer from low purity and/or high dilution levels. This makes fermenting these sugars into usable products and materials very difficult. They have less impact on the production of chemicals such as ethanol or other volatile compounds that can be easily purified and concentrated in the downstream processing steps. Several existing technological solutions to convert cellulose via sugar platforms into ethanol will soon be operating on a large scale 2. Other product types (bioplastics or non-volatile compounds, for example) with a complex post-conversion purification process require high-purity sugars.
While a great deal of work is ongoing to valorise lignin 3, valorising the third component of lignocellulose, hemicellulose, presents hurdles that need to be tackled.
The specific challenge of this topic is to better use the sugars from lignocellulosic feedstock in a sustainable way.
1First-generation sugars are produced from edible sources like sugar cane or sugar beet.
2See, for example, BBI projects BIOSKOH (http://bioskoh.eu/) and LIGNOFLAG (http://cordis.europa.eu/project/rcn/204324_en.html), but also other European or national projects.
3 See, for example, BBI projects SmartLi (http://clicinnovation.fi/activity/smartli/#More_information), Greenlight (http://www.innventia.com/greenlight) and Valchem (http://www.valchem.eu).
Scope:
Demonstrate innovative technologies and systems that can valorise sugars from hemicellulose and/or diluted or low-purity glucose streams from cellulose.
Proposals may apply biotechnological or non-biotechnological processes, or a combination thereof.
Proposals may target:
purified / concentrated sugars from hemicellulose; or
glucose from cellulose ‘as is’; or
separated hemicellulose ‘as is’; or
sugars or acids after hydrolysis and ‘as is’; or
fermentation or chemical catalysis of the hemicellulose’s sugars into intermediate products.
Depending on the selected routes, proposals may include purification steps.
This topic covers lignocellulosic feedstock from any suitable and sustainable source. Proposals should demonstrate sufficient availability of usable feedstock throughout the year, while applying the cascading use of biomass where relevant for maximum resource efficiency.
Proposals should justify the choice of feedstock (wood types and species), molecules and processing method based on the projected market requirements and value of the end-products. Proposals should ensure the sustainability of the route from lignocellulose to sugars, which should be compared to alternatives (such as sugar from crops). Proposals should demonstrate the marketability of the end-products. Proposals should aim at maximising the percentage, in weight, of valorised feedstock, preferably covering more than one component and more than one product.
This topic excludes: (1) the conversion of lignocellulosic feedstock into ethanol1; and (2) the pre-treatment and separation of lignocellulosic feedstock2.
Proposals should address the elimination of hurdles and bottlenecks regarding the logistics, transport modes and associated infrastructure in the targeted biomass feedstock supply systems. These include collection systems, intermediate storage and safety aspects (see Introduction - section 2.2.5 - published in the BBI JU AWP 2018).
Proposals should be based on a sound business case and business plan.
Proposals should commit to assessing the environmental and economic impacts of the developed products or processes, using LCA methodologies based on available standards, certification, accepted and validated approaches (see also introduction – section 2.2.5 - published in the BBI JU AWP 2018)3. If applicable, proposals should also analyse the social impacts.
If relevant, proposals should also allow for pre- and co-normative research necessary for developing the needed product quality standards.
The technology readiness level (TRL)4 at the end of the project should be 6-7. Proposals should clearly state the starting TRL.

Validate the technology for the utilisation of algae and other aquatic/marine biomass for the production of ingredients and proteins for food and feed, and of chemicals for pharmaceutical, cosmetics and nutraceutical applications.
Proposals should address upstream (adaptation and selection of varieties, growing conditions) and downstream (separation, purification and/or extraction of compounds) processing steps, with the overall aim to maximise the production of compounds of interest.
The projects should cover any Technology Readiness Level (TRL) from 3 to 5. In the case of a pilot scale project (TRL 5), proposals should present a credible cost estimate for the proposed processes with a preliminary assessment of their competitiveness when scaled up.

","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
The chemical industry in Europe is facing a number of challenges that may affect its global competitive position. The top three among these challenges relate to the enormous growth of the market and subsequent investments and production in China; the production of chemicals and materials in the Middle East based on amply available oil and gas; and the ‘shale gas revolution’ in the USA providing the local industry a significant advantage in raw material and energy availability. As a result, the share of European chemical production has dropped around 50% in the last 20 years. In addition, major new investments in production capacity have been taking place in China and the USA, while chemicals from these areas are increasingly finding their way to the European market.
To meet these challenges, the chemical industry in Europe has stepped up its drive towards higher resources- (raw material and water) and energy-efficiency, and has focused on business and operational excellence towards sustainability. While safeguarding base chemicals production, the industry has started to utilise renewable raw materials, making ‘drop-in’ bio-based chemicals to replace fossil-based products where justified, and at the same time making new bio-based products with new functionalities for initial niche market applications.
During the past years, many successful production and subsequent use of bio-based building blocks have started up. However, their production and applications are limited. Aside from technical and operational challenges, there is a plethora of hurdles in the fields of regulation and acceptance hindering the chemical industry to increase its bio-based portfolio.
The challenge is to make a clear overview of the hurdles in the fields of regulation and acceptance, set up a plan for their removal and agree on a roadmap for the chemical industry to increase production of bio-based building blocks for market applications that meet societal needs. The roadmap will specify the benefits for the chemical industry along the path towards a bioeconomy.
Scope:
Develop a roadmap for the chemical industry towards a higher bio-based portfolio and enjoying the benefits from the opportunities offered by the bioeconomy. The proposal will develop a roadmap for a better, faster, and more active contribution of the chemical industry in Europe towards the bioeconomy by 2030. The study should look at:
Identification of ‘sweet spots’ for the chemical industry in the next 10 years (i.e. where can the chemical industry be more effective and beneficial).
Competitiveness analysis between bio- and fossil-based products, including LCA’s to assess environmental and socio-economic benefits.
Identification of new market segments for bio-based products.
Compilation of regulatory barriers and a strategy to overcome them.
Show contribution of bio-based products to meeting societal needs.
Ways to communicate the benefits of bio-based products and increase public trust.
Communicate the chemical industry’s role as a critical driver of change into the bio-based economy and society.
Illustrate and interconnect up- and downstream players of the value chain.
Identify mutual benefits of cooperation between fossil- and bio-based industries.
Start up a process to strengthen the cooperation between the chemical industry, societal and governmental organisations.
Spell out the contribution of the chemical industry in a bioeconomy in the framework of the circular economy.
Developing a roadmap for the chemical industry should involve all stakeholders, seek complementarity to ongoing communication and awareness programmes for the community at large and also include:
Printed documents, events, workshops, showcases, and website to increase the awareness and importance of bio-based products.
The creation of an expert network on bioeconomy, sustainability and policy issues.
The Bio-based Industries Consortium (BIC) will set up an industry expert group from among its members which will provide expertise in the implementation and follow-up of the different tasks and also provide support to the organisation of meetings or workshops. This expert group should be a central part of the governance structure of the project.
Indicative funding: It is considered that proposals with a total eligible budget of up to EUR 1 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately.
Expected Impact:
Provide a roadmap for the chemical industry in Europe towards a valued and beneficial contribution to a bioeconomy, including production of marketable bio-based products that meet societal needs in specific market segments.
Provide a strategy by and for the chemical industry to unfold the full potential of bio-based products in Europe, including the challenges in rules and regulations that need to be overcome in order to boost the chemical sector’s participation in the bio-economy.

","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Combining several activities such as renewable energy, aquaculture, marine bio-resources and biotechnologies, maritime transport and related services, in the same marine space, including in multi-use platforms, can serve to divide and reduce the costs of offshore operations and the demand on the space needed for different activities. Research on multi-use platforms funded under the FP7 call ‘The Oceans of Tomorrow’ has provided promising designs, technological proposals and models for combining activities in terms of economic potential and environmental impact. Horizon 2020 funded projects have helped to identify and tackle regulatory and technological barriers and develop business models to reduce the risk for operators and investors. Before reaching a stage enabling large scale installations, it is necessary to develop pilots for demonstration in a real environment of multi-use platforms or co-location of activities in a marine space with their logistic support, including service vehicles and port facilities.
Scope:
Activities shall develop pilots by involving industrial actors and by integrating the available knowledge, technologies and facilities, in particular capitalising on the results of EU and national projects for the development of multi-use platforms or co-location of different activities in a marine space, and relevant support offshore vessels and autonomous vehicles. Pilots could include the reconversion/reuse of decommissioned platforms. The pilots shall aim to demonstrate in a real environment the viability (economic, social and environmental) of the multi-uses of a marine space for the output of at least two economic activities (such as renewable energy, aquaculture, marine bio-resources and biotechnologies, maritime activities and related services or tourism). The aim is to demonstrate the economic, social and environmental added-value of the multi-use of a marine space around coastal or deep sea environments and should include a business plan and a commercial economic feasibility assessment (informed by the Pilot's results), addressing possible trade-offs and costs for other sectors, for the combined activities to generate revenue. The pilots should also address health and safety issues, including for the logistics, ancillary infrastructure and maintenance services. Societal acceptance should also be integrated, especially by involving local communities. The interdisciplinary and cross-sectorial nature of the project should also apply to training activities improving the professional skills and competencies and supporting the creation of new jobs in the blue economy.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU in the range of EUR 9 million would allow this specific challenge to be adequately addressed. Nonetheless, this does not preclude the submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
In order to contribute to the implementation of the EU Integrated Maritime Policy and its environmental pillar, the EU Blue Growth Strategy, the EU Marine Strategy Framework Directive, the EU Maritime Spatial Planning Directive, the EU International Ocean Governance Communication, the EU Communication for a Sustainable European Future, the EU Bioeconomy Strategy, the EU Integrated Maritime Policy and in order to reinforce European competitiveness in the blue economy, activities shall:
In the short term:
Starting from technology readiness level (TRL) 5, bring selected designs of multi-purpose and multi-use facilities to TRL 7, ensuring validation in the real environment.
Improve health and safety in multi-use platforms or co-location of activities.
Reduce costs of implementation and increase economic viability of multi-use of marine space for the European maritime industry.

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
The northern seas of Europe - the Baltic Sea and the North Sea - are at the forefront of the global surge to enhance and realise marine and maritime potential. This enormous economy is directly and critically dependent on the quality and extent of the ecosystem services provided by the two regional seas and their coasts. In order to foster understanding of these coastal seas and the sustainable use of their goods and services (within the context of the EU Blue Growth Strategy, related policies and environmental legislation) challenges need to be addressed such as: fragmentation among nations and sectors, gaps in interdisciplinary knowledge, inadequate information on potential synergies and trade-offs between different sectors and the environment (including climate change issues), insufficient exchange of knowledge among scientists, industries and policy makers, and a need to increase attention to the societal inclusiveness and human well-being. To address these challenges, it is recognised that a significant and well-coordinated research effort between these two regional seas is necessary. BONUS, the Joint Baltic Sea Research and Development Programme, implemented under Article 185 of the TFEU, has already progressed towards consolidating such efforts among the Baltic Sea Member States. There is now an expressed interest and willingness to prepare conditions for launching a broader European North Sea and Baltic Sea Research and Innovation Programme.
Scope:
Activities shall focus on creating the necessary conditions for coordinated research and innovation efforts in the North Sea and Baltic Sea region in cooperation with BONUS by bringing together the main national funding agencies (programme owners and/or managers). They shall map and engage with relevant stakeholders in the region and especially further strengthen a possible new/successor programme with a sound North Sea component. Taking into account of existing commitments in relevant fora the activity shall focus on the preparation and delivery of a Joint Baltic-North Sea Strategic Research and Innovation Agenda, the creation of conditions (governance, management, financial, legal aspects and administration) and the development of an effective mechanism for its implementation, showing a strong commitment to achieve a sound level of integration (scientific, management and financial). Furthermore, they shall ensure visibility and broad involvement of the scientific community, public authorities, decision makers, and other stakeholders (including industry) in the region. The action shall facilitate consultation, awareness and commitment by all parties involved. The action shall also prepare and launch a long-term partnership ensuring appropriate funding from all the relevant participating states and a high leveraging effect. Finally, the action shall demonstrate the rationale of the initiative, EU added value, clearly identifying the problems that it proposes to tackle, likely impacts (scientific and technological, economic, social, environmental including climate-change, administrative, impacts on SMEs and on competitiveness and innovation) and main drivers. Synergies and harmonisation should be sought with other relevant ongoing national, regional, EU and international initiatives and institutions such as the Joint Programming Initiative ‘Healthy and Productive Seas and Oceans’, the International Council for the Exploration of the Seas (ICES), the Convention for the Protection of the Marine Environment of the North-East Atlantic (OSPAR Convention), the Baltic Marine Environment Protection Commission (HELCOM), etc. In agreement with the Commission services, projects should ensure appropriate flexibility so as to respond in real time to potentially fast-changing policy scenarios.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU in the range of EUR 2.5 million would allow this specific challenge to be adequately addressed. Nonetheless, this does not preclude the submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
In order to contribute to the implementation of the EU Integrated Maritime Policy, the EU Blue Growth Strategy, the EU Marine Strategy Framework Directive, the EU Maritime Spatial Planning Directive, the EU International Ocean Governance Communication, the EU Communication for a Sustainable European Future and other EU initiatives such as the Blue Growth Agenda for the Baltic Sea Region, Blue Growth and North Sea related activities, the EU Strategy for the Baltic Sea Region (EUSBSR) and the UN SDGs, activities shall contribute to the following:
In the short term:
Overcome fragmentation in research and innovation by developing a joint Baltic-North Sea Marine and Maritime Strategic Research and Innovation Agenda by the Baltic Sea and the North Sea countries.
Create lasting marine and maritime stakeholder platforms and integration mechanisms in the area, and establishing appropriate stakeholder collaboration mechanisms between the North Sea and Baltic Sea regions.

","11 June 2015","Scope:
Specific challenge Global warming and climate change are likely to affect all the biosphere's components and impact the functioning of all aquatic ecosystems and the living organisms that populate them. In the context of an increasing global population and demand for sufficient and safe food supplies, it is critical to predict and anticipate the nature and magnitude of potential impacts of climate change on food production systems. A lot of scientific effort is put on the understanding of the interrelations between the oceans and the climate system, which is also a key prerequisite for predicting and anticipating potential consequences of climate change on seafood production methods and systems. Ensuring sufficient preparedness and quick adaptation capacity of European marine and freshwater fisheries and aquaculture sectors to potential threats and opportunities due to climate change might be decisive for the long term sustainability of the two sectors, as well as for guaranteeing to European consumers and societies an acceptable degree of self-sufficiency of seafood supplies.
Scope: Proposals should give similar emphasis on both (A) and (B):
A. Proposals should focus on understanding how climate change may affect the most important and less resilient exploited European fish stocks and should cover the diversity of ecosystems and EU fisheries. They should provide new insights, at different geographic scales (in the major European oceans, seas and inland waters) and different climate change scenarios, on how climate-induced changes may affect important biological processes (including, reproductive success, population dynamics, migration patterns, interactions between fish populations, etc.). Particular focus should be given on risk assessment and management, elaboration of adaptation strategies for fisheries management and development of novel forecasting and early warning methodologies.
B.  Proposals should also investigate the potential effects and consequences of climate change on aquaculture taking into account the diversity of aquaculture practices, species and regional specificities, farming technologies and specific requirements of established and emerging European farmed species. Proposals should identify and model potential threats from global warming (including sea level rise, temperature/salinity changes, acidification, coastal erosion, HABs shellfish toxins, jellyfish, diseases spread and pathogens virulence, invasive species etc.) on the main segments of the European aquaculture sector (including freshwater), while considering the diversity of species and regional specificities of this sector. They should assess the economic risks related to these threats and should propose scenarios and realistic and cost-efficient adaptation and mitigation options and tools.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU in the range of EUR 5 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected impact:
Support fisheries management and aquaculture development by reducing uncertainties and risk, while optimising the scientific advice, policies implementation and production planning.
Allow regulators, fisherman and aquaculture operators to anticipate, prepare and adapt to different scenarios driven by climate change, while minimizing economic losses and social consequences.
Identify opportunities that might occur under the different scenarios and prepare to reap the potential benefits for the European fisheries, aquaculture and seafood sectors and for consumers.

","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
The interaction between people, oceans, seas and coasts is a broad domain with significant impacts on human health and well-being. However, it remains fragmented, poorly understood and underexploited. As coastal populations grow worldwide, not only due to permanent dwellers but also due to increasingly larger number of tourists, the determinants and impacts of this link between oceans and people become more relevant. On the one hand, the seas provide benefits namely through food, feed and positive impacts on overall wellness. On the other hand, the risks associated with the marine environment include chemical and physical pollutants of anthropogenic origin, harmful algal blooms, and countless marine microorganisms that lead to a still poorly assessed proportion of human morbidity and mortality. Therefore, the challenge is to coordinate the existing multidisciplinary research knowledge and resources, including distributed infrastructures, across Europe. This would make it easier to take advantage of the benefits and to better manage the risks of the interaction between oceans and people using an ecosystem-based approach and to formulate evidence-based policies that can benefit citizens as well as achieving good environmental status.
Scope:
Proposals should include a plan for the creation of a multi-stakeholder forum that would make it possible to better understand the potential health benefits of marine and coastal ecosystems including in economic terms, anticipate new threats to public health more effectively, identify ways of improving ecosystem services that the marine environment can provide and contribute to reducing the burden of diseases caused by the interplay between marine-degraded environments and human behaviour. This forum is expected to issue a strategic research agenda based on data covering the biological, cultural and socio-economic dimensions of the interaction between oceans and human health that can ultimately impact morbidity and mortality in the general population. Data should encompass sex and gender differences in the populations studied. Data should be assessed through an active involvement of diverse stakeholders across Europe, including local marine communities, civil society, industry, and public authorities.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of up to EUR 2 million would allow this challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude the submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Projects funded under this topic will by default participate in the Pilot on Open Research Data in Horizon 2020, with the option to opt-out, as described in the introduction.
Expected Impact:
In order to support key EU policies, in particular those directly related to the marine and maritime sectors, such as the EU Blue Growth Agenda, the Blue Tourism Communication and the Marine Strategy Framework Directive, proposals are expected to:
Create a multi-stakeholder forum that issues a strategic research agenda for oceans and human health, based on new scientific and/or technological evidence and best practices across different geographical locations and climates.
Highlight novel, cost-effective solutions or interventions that enable effective policy making that aims to maximise health benefits and minimising risks derived from exposure to marine and coastal ecosystems.
Actively involve local communities across different European maritime regions, comprising civil society, industry, public authorities in data supply, knowledge generation and solution implementation processes.

Aquatic biomass from the seas and oceans, rivers and lakes has a large potential to ensure future food and nutrition security and to supply raw materials for other high added value chains and products, such as bioenergy, pharmaceuticals and cosmetics while factoring in environment and climate change risks. These so-called provisioning ecosystem services could ensure private and public benefits, while demonstrating synergies or trade-offs with a broader range of ecosystem services. However, this potential is currently underutilised due to a lack of synergies between sectors and of adequate investments. Consequently, EU intervention is needed to create the conditions to mobilise investments by aligning national and regional innovation research agendas across different blue bioeconomy sectors.
Scope:
Activities shall pool the necessary financial resources from the participating national and/or regional research programmes with a view to implementing a joint call for proposals with EU co-funding resulting in grants to third parties. Proposers are requested to implement other joint activities, including additional joint calls without EU co-funding. Activities shall address innovative, sustainable and climate-friendly possibilities to produce, harvest and exploit aquatic biomass from different trophic levels for use in food and other value chains. The technical and economic feasibility of these possibilities should be clearly demonstrated by including in the projects industry partners that contribute a concrete and feasible business perspective. The ERA-NET Cofund shall address research and innovation gaps such as achieving zero waste by optimising the use of underutilised and waste material from fisheries and aquaculture and apply biotechnology and ICT in the blue bioeconomy to develop smart, efficient, traceable food systems and other biomaterials and create synergies between aquaculture and fisheries (e.g. through genetic assessment); to unlock the potential of microbiomes in aquaculture, fisheries, food processing and biotechnology; to create predictive tools to improve the identification, targeting and conservation of biodiversity “hot-spots” in the oceans (e.g. through omics-based technologies); explore synergies with land-based production in areas such as food and feed processing, biorefining, bioenergy, biomaterials, chemicals and nutrients, and include waste streams from aquatic to terrestrial value chains; to improve aquaculture and fisheries by using a combination of methods, processes and technologies such as biotechnology to create innovative feeds, improve brood stock, introduce new species, improve biosecurity, define stock baselines, and assess stocks. Activities shall also build on developments derived from relevant Framework Programme projects. Activities shall also aim to implement other joint activities without EU co-funding, on issues related to fisheries, aquaculture, seafood processing and aquatic biotechnology in line with the Strategic Research and Innovation Agenda of the Joint Programming Initiative ""Healthy and Productive Seas and Oceans""[1], the COFASP Strategic Research Agenda[2], and the Marine Biotech Strategic Research and Innovation Roadmap[3]. Inclusion of societal actors and stakeholders at large during the whole research and innovation process shall allow to better align both the process and its outcomes with the values, needs and expectations of society while facilitating the creation of new value chains in the market. The interdisciplinary and cross-sectorial nature of the project should also apply to training activities improving the professional skills and competencies and supporting the creation of new jobs in the blue economy. Proposers have to demonstrate that the topic for the cofunded call excludes duplication with calls launched or planned under Horizon 2020.
Participation of legal entities from international partner countries will be encouraged in the joint call as well as in other joint activities including additional joint calls without EU co-funding. Participants from countries which are not automatically eligible for funding may request a EU contribution (on the basis of the ERA-NET unit cost) for the coordination costs of additional activities.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU in the range of EUR 8 million would allow this specific challenge to be adequately addressed. Nonetheless, this does not preclude the submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:

Specific challenge:
Since the end of the cold war the relative global political stability created through the balance of power between the Soviet Union and the US has considerably decreased. Across the world the new multipolar structure of international politics reopened dormant conflicts and lead to new emerging crisis situations.
Overcoming these new conflicts necessitates novel approaches on prevention, mediation and peace keeping to which the occidental world is only insufficiently prepared. Classical stabilisation/intervention operations are often not appropriate anymore, nor do they guarantee any long term stability. Conflicts cannot be overcome solely by military or civilian means alone.
The majority of these conflicts are asymmetrical by nature. This often implies that the primary victims are non-combatants, particularly in civil wars. The humanitarian crises (famines, epidemics, forced migrations) that follow often affect especially women and children. These conflicts represent both a humanitarian obligation for the EU to act, and a liability for the external and internal security of the EU. Economic and political disparities have often proven to be a breeding ground for political extremism, violent radicalisation and terrorism.
These geopolitical changes and challenges are reflected in the articles 42-46 on the Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP) of the Treaty on European Union: “the Union may use civilian and military means, shall include joint disarmament operations, humanitarian and rescue tasks, military advice and assistance tasks, conflict prevention and peace-keeping tasks, tasks of combat forces in crisis management, including peace-making and post-conflict stabilisation.”
Scope:
Research in this field should focus on :
Analysing past and on-going civilian and military efforts of the EU, its Member States, Associated Countries and international organisations (UN, OSCE) on conflict prevention and peace building in and between third countries.  
Assessing the potential for pooling and sharing of capabilities and technologies for civilian conflict prevention.
Research should go beyond the short term stabilisation/conflict prevention and focus on long-term peace building by civilian means.
A catalogue of best practices and lessons learned should be developed in the form of a living document.
Identifying research priorities on civilian conflict prevetion for Horizon 2020 security research.
Special attention should be paid to civilian-military synergies on an operational level.
Expected impact:
Projects resulting from this topic should develop a clear assessment of the capabilities of the EU for external conflict prevention and peace building and identify the best civilian means to enhance these capabilities.
A set of clear policy priorities and technological needs on civilian conflict prevention should be developed, with a focus on the exploitation of civilian-military synergies.

","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
The seafood[1] production and processing industry contributes substantially to food security, employment and trade in regions where the activity takes place. To safeguard and strengthen this and make the activity more sustainable, seafood production should be market-driven and consumer-responsive, addressing challenges such as increasing consumer awareness of food quality and safety traceability and animal welfare. Ensuring the sustainability of the seafood processing industry involves not only innovative technologies that could mitigate production hazards and environmental damage but also securing its economic viability and taking account of the consumer imperatives behind them. One way of ensuring the sustainable production and processing of nutritious and safe seafood products is through the demonstration and first application in the market of eco-innovative, sustainable processing solutions of marine and aquaculture-derived food products and nutrients.
Scope:
Proposals should build on state-of-the-art research insights from EU and other funded projects in this field, with a specific focus on nutrition, quality and food safety (from harvesting to the final products). They should aim to generate new knowledge to develop commercial solutions for improving the socio-economic and environmental sustainability of the seafood production and processing industry, while also contributing to product quality and safety. Activities should directly aim to produce plans and arrangements or designs for new, altered or improved products, processes or services. For this purpose they may include prototyping, testing, demonstrating, piloting, and large-scale product validation, all with a view to paving the way for subsequent market replication and uptake by consumers. Proposals may take into account impacts across different locations and population segments, as well as the specificities of different types of seafood, also in terms of nutrition. Work is expected to benefit from the contribution of social sciences wherever applicable. Where relevant, proposals should address gender-specific aspects, and the gender dimension in the research content shall be taken into account[2]. Aspects of traceability, authentication and certification of EU seafood products and labels of quality should be conveniently addressed. The participation of SMEs that will benefit from the intellectual property and/or from the commercial use of the project outcomes is encouraged.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of up to EUR 7 million would allow this challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude the submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Projects funded under this topic will by default participate in the Pilot on Open Research Data in Horizon 2020, with the option to opt-out, as described in the introduction.
Expected Impact:
To contribute to EU food safety common standards and legislation for seafood products and nutrients, proposals are expected to:
Ensure that eco-innovative solutions for the sustainable production and processing of marine and aquaculture-derived food products and nutrients are used more widely, as a result of greater user acceptance, higher visibility of innovative solutions and the creation of scalable markets.
Improve the competitiveness of the EU seafood sector, and increase opportunities for growth, diversification and job creation for the sector in general and SMEs in particular.
Benefit consumers by allowing them to make better-informed seafood choices.
Increase the availability of healthier, safer and high quality seafood, which will improve consumers' diet and health.
Improve the professional skills and competences of those working and being trained to work within the blue economy.

","04 September 2019","Specific Challenge:
The Atlantic Ocean is an invaluable shared resource. The societal value of its blue economy is enormous for countries located on its shores. There are however, still considerable gaps in our knowledge and understanding of processes related to this ocean especially with regard to its chemistry, ecology, biodiversity, impacts of climate and the potential for the sustainable exploitation of its natural resources including aquaculture. The Atlantic Ocean is subject to a range of pressures, such as impacts related to climate change, pollution, fishing above sustainable levels, mining and coastal eutrophication. Both remote and local forces play a role in these changes and it is necessary to consider local, regional and basin-wide drivers and factors to understand, predict and adapt to change. Furthermore, the potential of seafood to reduce food and nutrition insecurity calls for collaboration at international level. Having already demonstrated how successful research cooperation can be in the North Atlantic Ocean[1] in tackling some of these issues, the objective now is to take a systemic approach to tackle the scientific and socio-economic challenges and to move towards a basin-wide cooperation from Antarctica to the Arctic, through enhanced cooperation with countries bordering the South Atlantic, notably Brazil and South Africa[2].
Scope:
The actions shall aim at understanding and sustainably managing the Atlantic Ocean as a whole, through a large-scale basin effort involving both the northern and the southern parts of this ocean and its interlinks with the adjacent areas. In order to achieve this, it is necessary to bring together and systematically connect scientists, stakeholders, data, knowledge, expertise, capacities, and resources. This is only feasible through the synergistic cooperation among the bordering countries. With the development of a South Atlantic Ocean Science Plan[3] focusing on the challenges and research needs of the South Atlantic Ocean, which are also interconnected with the challenges and research needs of the North Atlantic Ocean, this cooperation can converge towards the implementation of a systemic approach by linking and jointly tackling the climate-food-ocean challenges. Overall, activities shall contribute to upscale cooperation along and across the Atlantic Ocean and the creation of long-term partnerships building on on-going initiatives such as the All Atlantic Ocean Research Alliance. In order to realise this, proposals shall address one of the following sub-topics:
[A] 2018 - Coordination of marine and maritime research and innovation activities in the Atlantic Ocean. Activities shall launch a multi-stakeholder platform to reinforce international cooperation between Europe and tropical and South Atlantic countries and to connect with the challenges and research needs of the North Atlantic Ocean, as outlined above. The platform shall address the key following points: enhance business opportunities and the up-take of innovations e.g. aquaculture production systems, marine and maritime technologies; develop common standards e.g. for deep ocean and shelf observing systems, seafloor mapping, ecosystem approaches in utilizing marine living resources; reinforce capacity building by aligning European training programmes, including through industrial apprenticeship opportunities and networking with Atlantic partners; promote citizen awareness and literacy on ocean issues; align and converge international research and innovation cooperation activities and other relevant initiatives and investments between the northern and southern Atlantic countries. It will upscale cooperation with countries bordering the South Atlantic Ocean, in particular Brazil and South Africa, by reinforcing the mutual benefits of science diplomacy, addressing the grand challenges and opportunities of the Atlantic Ocean as a system, exploiting the benefits it holds for our citizens and entering a new era of Blue Enlightenment which spans from Antarctica to the Arctic.
This action should build on past and ongoing regional, national initiatives and programmes e.g. PIRATA[4], SAMOC[5], SA MAR-ECO[6], GEOTRACES[7], SOLAS[8], OTN[9], ICEMASA[10], BCLME[11], and EU projects e.g. MAREFRAME, BIOMORE, ATLANTOS, AORAC-SA, EU POLAR Net, INMARE, PREFACE etc. as well as national initiatives across and alongside the Atlantic Ocean. It should also involve (or liaise with) relevant European research infrastructures such as Euro-Argo ERIC and EMSO ERIC. In agreement with the Commission services, projects should ensure appropriate flexibility so as to respond in real time to potentially fast-changing policy scenarios.
[B] 2018-2019- Assessing the status of Atlantic marine ecosystems. Activities shall enhance the knowledge on the status and dynamics of Atlantic marine ecosystems, quantifying main drivers of short and long-term change, examine the interactions between different stressors, including climate change, and the role of cumulative impacts on ecosystem functioning and associated ecosystem services. They shall also contribute to improve the sustainability of the exploitation of the marine resources, through extending climate based predictions as well as testing for so-called tipping points, regimes shifts or more advanced assessments of ecosystem stability. Activities may entail 3D–mapping of the water column and high resolution seafloor mapping of selected large areas (including relevant marine ecosystems), considering the feasibility/safety and sustainability of these maritime operations. Mapping shall include variables of a different nature, such as physical, biological, chemical, habitats, seafloor characteristics and integrity (including in relation to climate change) and may require the development of new technologies. Furthermore, demonstration of cost-effective approaches to management and processing of the large quantities of data, better coordinated data sharing and operability, as well as the development of improved forecasting capabilities of stressors, tipping points, recovery and changes in ecosystem state will be important. The participation of industrial and regional stakeholders is encouraged to help define ecosystem-requirements. All data collected by the projects (including in international waters) shall be made open access by the end of the project. The choices of the selected areas need to be justified. Actions shall include capacity building and training with/in countries bordering the South and Tropical Atlantic Ocean. Links with ongoing initiatives such as EMODNet should be considered. The activities will be carried out in close co-operation with relevant Commission services (Directorate-General for Research and Innovation), ensuring coherence with related policy initiatives.
[C] 2018-2019- New value chains for aquaculture[12] production. Activities shall explore new species, products and/or processes for aquaculture production (including algae). They shall consider existing, emerging and potential markets, take into consideration sound cost-effective production methods, sustainability and profitability. Consideration shall be given to the design of Internet of Things (IoT) approaches in the development of innovative production technologies, including new/improved biosensors, the circularity of the processes with the objective of zero waste and consider consumers' concerns and demands. The development of monitoring programmes for risk assessment including emerging pollutants and climate change resilience and mitigation will be essential. Activities shall contribute to reduce risks to human health. They will also foster higher levels of economic productivity through diversification, technological upgrading and innovation, including through a focus on high-value added and labour-intensive sectors. Finally, it will be important to reinforce capacity building by aligning training programmes, including through industrial apprenticeship opportunities and networking along and across the Atlantic Ocean, in particular, but not exclusively, with South Africa and Brazil and other Atlantic Ocean coastal states. Reinforcing links between industrial partners is also crucial to exchange best practices and to facilitate the creation of business opportunities, therefore the SME participation in this topic is encouraged.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU respectively in the range of EUR 4 million for sub-topic [A] (Coordination and Support Action), EUR 9 million for sub-topic [B] (Research and Innovation Action) and EUR 8 million for sub-topic [C] (Research and Innovation Action) would allow this specific challenge to be adequately addressed. Nonetheless, this does not preclude the submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Consortia submitting proposals to this Flagship are encouraged to include participants from countries bordering the Atlantic Ocean (North and South) as their active participation is key to the success of the proposals.
Proposals shall include a task to cluster with other projects financed under this topic and – if possible – with other relevant projects in the field funded by Horizon 2020. Possible links with related research and innovation activities supported by the Belmont Forum[13] on Ocean sustainability shall also be considered.
Expected Impact:

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Debris, chemical and microbial pollution and algae jellyfish blooms are huge and increasing problems in the oceans, seas and coasts. For plastics alone, the economic and ecological cost is considerable when including beach clean-ups, tourism losses, and damages to the fishing and aquaculture industries. In spite of strong legislation such as EU directives, sea and coastal pollution remains high, and prevention and innovative coast and sea clean-up schemes remain a challenge. Many solutions are available to tackle these sources of pollution, including recycling, waste water treatment, teams of collectors, and specific equipment such as skimmer boats, beach cleaning machines or algae harvesting devices. However, there is a pressing need to develop powerful innovative methods and processes to clean coasts and oceans and to restore the ecosystems to a healthy and clean state. The foremost challenge is not only to remove litter and pollution, but to transform the collected waste into a resource stream in line with the concept of the circular economy.
Scope:
The proposals should be for demonstration projects to clean and lay the ground for a healthy ocean or sea and its coasts in any given large geographic area(s), including regional seas or semi-closed sea basins such as the Mediterranean. The demonstration projects should develop and scale-up innovative processes and measures to clean the selected site[1] from visible (for example floating plastics or abandoned fishing gear) and invisible litter (micro-plastics) and pollutants[2], involving local communities and actors. Collected waste materials should be adequately processed so as to enable a subsequent usage/ exploitation/ re-usage. The proposals should apply an ecosystem approach, developing forecasting tools and models to identify areas where the proposed intervention is likely to be most effective in ecological and economic terms. Social acceptance and economic impact of the envisaged measures must also be considered and promoted, for example by disseminating the project results to relevant stakeholders.
In line with the objective of the EU Strategy for international cooperation in research and innovation (COM (2012) 497), proposals addressing the Mediterranean should contribute to implement the Research and Innovation Initiative for Blue Jobs and Growth in the Mediterranean Area (The BLUEMED Initiative).[3]
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of up to EUR 6 million would allow this challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude the submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
To contribute to the implementation of EU Policies such as the Marine Strategy Framework Directive and its aim to achieve a good environment status for Europe’s seas and oceans by 2020, proposals are expected to:
Develop innovative technological methods or processes for cleaning coasts and seas and transforming waste into a resource.
Reduce cleaning up/restoration costs through cost-effective solutions, in particular through enhanced resource efficiency.
Increase awareness and acceptance of civil society about the importance of healthy oceans and seas, devoid of litter and pollutants, in civil society.
Progress towards reducing pollution and debris (macro, micro and nano) in regional sea basins and beyond, and towards restoring marine ecosystems.
Improve the professional skills and competences for those working and being trained to work within the blue economy.

","Innovation action
","16 October 2018
","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Our future is intimately linked to the future of the seas, oceans and coasts. The seas, oceans and coasts provide multiple ecosystem services and a wealth of resources, influence climate and provide many economic opportunities. To fully profit from the seas and oceans also in the future, we have to preserve those valuable resources and ensure that their exploitation is sustainable. Furthermore, without appropriate ocean observations for forecasting and for the protection of property and human activities, the global economy would lose hundreds of billions of euros annually. For this, we need to have the technologies for observations, integrated ocean observing systems, data management systems, and appropriate models and services. This action will contribute to make ocean observations and data management in European seas and the Atlantic Ocean fit for the future, in line with the G7 Future of the Oceans Initiative (Tsukuba Communiqué of the G7 Science Ministers[1]). It will also support the Collaborative Research Action on Oceans of the Belmont Forum[2] and the International Ocean Governance Communication[3]. Similarly, ocean observation data must be available to effectively address local, national and global challenges such as the forecasting of ocean conditions and climate change, to take stock of biomass and biodiversity, to mitigate the impact of climate change and ocean acidification, to ensure food security and food safety (also in fresh water), and to contribute to the UN 2030 Sustainable Development Agenda, notably UN SDGs 2, 13, 14 and 15, and monitoring their targets for 2020 and 2025.
Scope:
Proposals shall address one of the following sub-topics: blue cloud services, or ocean observations and forecasting[4], or technologies for observations (in 2020). Actions shall demonstrate integration, capacity and (scientific, economic etc) potential. They shall complement and build on existing observation tools and systems such as EuroGOOS/EOOS, IOOS, GEO/GEOSS, COPERNICUS Marine Service or EMODnet, European research infrastructures such as Euro-Argo ERIC and EMSO ERIC as well as funded H2020 projects such as SeaDataCloud[5]. The interdisciplinary and cross-sectorial nature of the proposal should also apply to training activities improving the professional skills and competencies of workers and supporting the creation of new jobs in the blue economy.
[A] 2019 - Blue Cloud services
Activities shall develop cloud services for applications that are specific for oceans, seas and fresh water bodies and are necessary for marine ecosystems research, conservation, forecasting and innovation in the Blue Economy, building and implementing also Blue Cloud demonstrators as needed. Blue Cloud demonstrators should integrate the Essential Ocean Variables[4], notably the biological variables, including plankton biomass and diversity. They shall build on ongoing efforts (data, tools, EOSC, including its Pilot Blue Cloud, Data and Information Access Services (DIAS) of COPERNICUS, etc) and take account of the parallel EOSC thematic initiatives being developed – such as the Food Cloud Demonstrator.[5] The action shall contribute to unlocking the innovation potential of the Blue Cloud, and demonstrate its potential in promoting the blue economy shortening the time span between research and innovation in frontier fields, such as micro-organisms and genomics-enabled innovations[8]. Activities shall build on existing research infrastructures, take advantage of existing data sharing activities (for example EMODnet), and build on relevant results of past and on-going global, national and EU projects such as SeaDataCloud[9], BlueBridge, the EOSC Pilot and other relevant projects funded under Horizon 2020, including those under Information and Communication Technologies[10]. Proposals should include a task to cluster with other projects financed under this topic and – if possible – with other relevant projects in the field funded by Horizon 2020.
[B] 2019 - Observations and forecasting
The action shall contribute to the development and demonstration of the feasibility of the European component of a future Global Ocean Observing System in line with the G7 Tsukuba Communiqué[4]. It will support activities in the different EU sea basins and the Atlantic Ocean, including the deep sea (below 2000 m), also supporting the needs of food security and safety as outlined in Food 2030[5]. It will also support the future Collaborative Research Action on Oceans of the Belmont Forum[8]. It will underpin forecasting of the state of the ocean, climate change impact and weather. Activities shall include the demonstration of methods and technologies and their integration in existing systems to collect information on the state and variability of European seas and the Atlantic Ocean, including the impact of stressors and marine litter, and underpin sustainable management of the marine environment and its resources (e.g. the effect of networks of protected areas and other spatial protection measures). They shall take account of the needs deriving from the G7 Future of the Seas and Oceans Initiative[9], from actions such as the Atlantic Ocean Research Alliance and its related South Atlantic Flagship, the BLUEMED Initiative, and notably common priorities with the WestMED Initiative[10]and the EUSAIR[16], and actions addressing other European regional seas. The inclusion of forecasting tools (for example to protect aquaculture installations or to inform fisheries decision making) shall be an advantage. Similarly, the sustainability of the approach selected, the integration of innovative observations solutions and existing systems, the smooth storage of data in open access data centres and the improvement of the predictive capability shall be demonstrated. Observations and data handling may also include pilots for Essential Ocean Variables (EOVs)[17] under consideration (for example, nutrients, carbonate, sound and microbes/omics) and variables that are of importance in European regional seas as well as the integration of “augmented” observatories (i.e. genomic-enabled multidisciplinary observatories)[18]. Flow of information across variables and disciplines shall be included. Data collected shall be in line with agreed standards, be openly available via portals (including EMODnet) and feed into the Pilot Blue Cloud (part of the European Open Science Cloud). International cooperation with Third Country partners is encouraged.
Proposals shall include a task to cluster with other projects financed under this topic and – if possible – with other relevant projects in the field funded by Horizon 2020. Possible links with related research and innovation activities supported by the Belmont Forum[19] on Ocean sustainability shall also be considered.
[C] 2020 - Technologies for observations
Proposals shall address i) the demonstration of new and innovative technologies to measure the Essential Ocean Variables (EOV) at all depths, and ii) sensors to measure variables for aquaculture, fisheries, micro and nanoplastics, and marine litter and micro-litter, iii) the demonstration of novel approaches to observe the ocean with multiple underwater, surface, and air vehicles (surface and air vehicles are optional, but underwater must always be included) with a view to realizing the digital ocean. Optional air vehicles could potentially, among others, contribute to the development of fully documented fisheries.
Sensors should measure in-situ biogeochemical and biological EOVs and may include new or emerging EOVs (possibly defined at OceanObs19[20] or those needed for MSFD Descriptors) as well as technologies needed for “augmented” observatories (i.e. genome-enabled multidisciplinary observatories) to allow deeper investigation of marine biology and ecology and as sites to test the new technology. Demonstrations to advance deep sea oceanography, notably biological oceanography, by combinations of fleets of gliders, fixed stations, research vessels, etc. should reach TRL 6 or higher. Proposals may also cover the standards, protocols and communications needed for the observations, for open access to data, standards for data management and communication. Activities to transfer technologies from other sectors (for example combinations with data from satellites) will also be considered. The proposals shall also address issues such as low-power, miniaturisation, modularity, interoperability and low-cost. The proposals shall take agreed standards (for example Open Geospatial Consortium standards) into account. The development of new vehicles or other platforms are excluded from this call. Data collected (except data for testing) must be prepared in line with commonly agreed standards and be made available in a form suitable for EMODnet and clouds.
This topic is in support of the European Strategy for Plastics in a Circular Economy. Selected projects under this topic as well as projects selected under other topics in H2020 supporting the Plastics Strategy are strongly encouraged to participate in joint activities as appropriate. These joint activities could take the form of clustering of projects, participation in workshops, common exploitation and dissemination etc. The projects should describe how they will be complementary with already existing relevant national activities or other multilateral activities funded by the EU or funded jointly by several Member States. The proposals are expected to demonstrate support to common coordination and dissemination activities. Therefore, the proposals should foresee a dedicated work package for this purpose and earmark appropriate resources. Further details of these coordination activities will be defined during the grant preparation phase with the Commission.
Please note that this topic is part of the lump sum funding pilot scheme. Funding for grants awarded under this topic will take the form of lump sums as defined in Commission Decision C(2017)7151 of 27 October 2017. Details of the lump sum funding pilot scheme are published on the Funding and Tender Portal together with the specific Model Grant Agreement for Lump Sums applicable.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU in the range of EUR 6 million for sub-topic [A], EUR 12 million for sub-topic [B] and EUR 9 million for sub-topic [C] would allow this specific challenge to be adequately addressed. Nonetheless, this does not preclude the submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.

","31 October 2017
","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Contamination of soils, sediments, ground and surface water caused by waste resulting from human action and leakage into water sources is a serious problem. This pollution contains compounds having toxicity and durability which creates important concerns from the health and environmental viewpoints. Moreover, it represents a significant economic burden for society.
In some standard remediation strategies, for example burying polluted soils in landfills, pollutants are not destroyed and the problem is merely postponed. Chemical remediation and the disposal of contaminated waste increase the health risk for workers. Bioremediation, which uses naturally occurring microorganisms, is a more sustainable and gentle alternative to physicochemical options.
Microorganisms have developed countless strategies to depollute their environment and to transform harmful environmental contaminants into harmless end products. However, the effectiveness of bioremediation faces a number of challenges, for instance the concentration of the contaminant, the combined biological activity of the microbial community over time and space and the consumption of energy.
Scope:
Proposals should include research and innovation for efficient and low cost remediation strategies using microorganisms by means of (bio-)electrochemical systems, or alternate systems that require minimum or zero external energy or chemicals. The work should ensure that an acceptable performance for field applications can be attained. Remediation should cover hydrocarbons and their derivatives, metals, nutrients, antibiotics or micropollutants. Moreover, the system developed should remove different contaminants, including complex mixtures, the remediation time should be accelerated and it should work with mixed microbial communities.
This topic is part of the EU-China flagship initiative on Biotechnology for Environment and Human Health, which will promote substantial coordinated and balanced research and Innovation cooperation between the EU and China. China-based participants have the possibility to apply for funding under the Chinese co-funding mechanism and other Chinese sources[1].
Activities should start at TRL 3 and achieve TRL 5 at the end of the project.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU up to EUR 5 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
Remediation of at least two toxic contaminants;
Proof of the feasibility of scaling up the technology for field testing, including an assessment of the related environmental benefits and risks;
A demonstration of the benefits over standard physicochemical remediation approaches, including energy efficiency.

","14 May 2020","Specific Challenge:
The European Strategy for Plastics in a Circular Economy acknowledges the usefulness of plastics for the economy and our daily lives, but points out that plastics' use fails to capture the economic and environmental benefits of a more 'circular' approach. The progressive substitution of consumer products derived from fossil fuels, at all steps along the industrial value-chain, is crucial to successfully decarbonise our society. Most plastic (>98%) is produced from non-renewable sources. This is more than 400 million tonnes globally, which could become 900 million tonnes by 2050, i.e. 20% of oil consumption. The majority of plastic cannot be recycled and contains toxic additives. Some plastics are bio-based; however not all are recyclable, reusable or biodegradable.
Annually, Europe produces 78 million tonnes of plastics, 40% of is used for packaging and mainly for packaging food, drinks and other consumer products with a short shelf-live. Packaging that cannot be recycled ends up in landfills or is burnt in, a process that releases large amounts of CO2 and toxic chemicals into the atmosphere.
The challenge is to develop technologies to deal with the upcycling of plastics for food and drinks packaging. Upcycling in this context means transforming them into new materials or products of better quality or for better environmental value, ensuring that micro-plastics are avoided. This will allow the sustainable recycling or biological degradation in accordance with existing and novel technologies, standards and certification schemes.
Scope:
Proposals will address as many as possible of the following aspects:
Expand the potential of current technologies and materials for the manufacturing and design of bio-plastics that are recyclable and/or bio-degradable;
Exploit known or develop new biotechnologies, based on enzymes or enzyme combinations and microorganisms, for improved recycling or biodegradation of plastics;
Develop novel standards and certification schemes applicable to packaging materials made from recyclable and biodegradable bio-plastics;
Include Social Sciences and Humanities (SSH) elements and gender aspects to improve consumer attitude and behaviour with respect to purchasing and recycling food and drink packaging;
Take a systemic approach and involve cooperation among actors in the supply chain, from producer to final consumer, and from research to policy makers.
Projects should perform an analysis of the state of the art to avoid duplications and overlaps with past or ongoing research, including projects funded by the Bio-based Industries Initiative[1] and the Circular Economy calls under H2020.
Clustering activities to capitalise on synergies with relevant projects selected under this topic and topic CE NMBP 26-2018 is encouraged.
Proposals submitted under this topic should include a business case and exploitation strategy, as outlined in the Introduction to the LEIT part of this Work Programme.
Activities should start at TRL 3 and achieve TRL 6 at the end of the project.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU between EUR 6 and 8 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
60% food and drink packaging is upcycled by 2030;
A viable roadmap to prove that by 2030 60% of the plastics still to be used for packaging of foods and drinks with short-shelf life will be produced from renewable sources;
Contribute to the increase in new and upgraded waste recycling facilities designed to facilitate recycling via biotechnological or biochemical methods;
Increased awareness among European citizens of products and materials upcycling capacity;
Novel standards and certification schemes to be applied together with market pull measures such as public procurement and tax exemptions;
Indicators and metrics, with baseline values, including demonstration activities should be clearly stated in the proposal.
This topic is in support of the European Strategy for Plastics in a Circular Economy[2]. Projects selected under this topic as well as projects selected under other topics[3] in H2020 supporting the Plastics Strategy are strongly encouraged to participate in joint activities as appropriate. These joint activities could take the form of clustering of projects, participation in workshops, common exploitation and dissemination etc. The proposals are expected to demonstrate support to common coordination and dissemination activities without the prerequisite to define concrete common actions at this stage.

","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Our current food systems are unsustainable and threatened by global pressures. Environmental challenges (e.g. climate change, loss of biodiversity, scarcity and degradation of natural resources), combined with increasing social inequalities amplified by poverty, hunger and malnutrition, and urbanisation, are putting serious pressure on cities and their peri-urban interfaces.
It is estimated that by 2050, not only will food demand increase, but also over 70% of people will be living in cities. Therefore, future proofing our food systems will require a rethinking of the role of cities as agents of positive change. Cities have the potential to become ecosystems of innovation facilitating experimentation and multi-stakeholder engagement, to establish long-term evidence-based strategies that will ultimately ensure safe, healthy, sustainable and nutritious food to their inhabitants and surrounding communities.
Local authorities have a key role to play in convening, connecting and supporting food system actors and citizens across their City Region Food System (CRFS) [1] to build and deliver transformative solutions with real societal impact based on sound science, research and innovation. However, the degree of embedding of systemic thinking into urban food policies varies greatly among cities and many of the existing fragmented initiatives focus on the production and/or the consumption side only.
The specific challenge of this topic, therefore, is to support cities to overcome existing barriers to food system transformation and develop integrated, sustainable and safe urban food system policies/strategies in line with the FOOD 2030 policy priorities (i.e. Nutrition for sustainable and healthy diets; Climate-smart and environmentally sustainable food systems; Circularity and resource efficient food systems; and Innovation and empowerment of communities).
Scope:
Proposals shall support cities and their peri-urban interface to develop and implement urban food systems policies delivering on the four FOOD 2030 priorities accompanied by the deployment of concrete actions. Innovation shall be fostered via the establishment of FOOD 2030 living labs as open innovation ecosystems.
The proposals shall draw key learnings from existing good practices in cities that have already engaged themselves in food policies and practices (e.g. the signatories of the MUFPP). Proposals shall include a wide diversity of cities (e.g. in terms of size and geography) that also ensure a good pan-European coverage. Furthermore, proposals shall include cities that have a 'good track record' in food systems transformation, as well as less experienced cities which aspire to put food systems transformation at the heart of their policy agenda.
In line with the principles of Responsible Research and Innovation (RRI), proposals shall support urban participatory policy processes that convene a wide variety of public and private stakeholders throughout the whole food system from farm to fork to gut and back.
These shall include, for instance: food producers, processors, retailers, procurers, food service industry, nutritionists, universities, SMEs and local/regional business, educators, behavioural and social scientists, museums/science centres, professional associations, innovative ICT companies, banks, venture capitalists and other sources of investment, NGOs, media and citizens and taken into account gender aspects. The set-up of a living lab in each city is required[2]. In particular, proposals shall collaborate with local authorities with a view of creating political commitment and institutionalising the expected food policy for a long-term deployment.
Proposals shall also deploy a compelling communication and dissemination strategy to share best practices throughout a broader network in order to inspire, share learnings and mobilise other cities, regions and national governments. Finally, proposals shall dedicate resources to attract additional financial investments and opportunities to ensure the long-term sustainability of the planned actions. Proposals shall require a strong centralized professional coordination to ensure cities are assisted in implementing a harmonised approach, to allow comparability assessment and to develop an aligned overarching communication strategy.
Proposals shall also foresee the inclusion of a specific and budgeted work-package in view to cooperating closely with other projects funded under this topic and with the European Commission, in particular to align with the FOOD 2030 framing, for consistent communication and dissemination, monitoring and comparability of outcomes. Furthermore, proposals shall foresee cooperation with relevant projects in this domain under Horizon 2020 (e.g. with the projects funded under CE-SFS-24-2019) and other programmes.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU in the range of EUR 12 million would allow this specific challenge to address at least 10 cities. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts and number of cities.

In the framework of the objectives of FOOD 2030, as well as of the New Urban Agenda and the UN Sustainable Development Goals, in particular SDG 11 on “Sustainable Cities and Communities”, this topic is expected to support the development of sustainable, healthy and inclusive food systems policies in city-regions, where system thinking, institutional innovation and participatory planning are at the core.
In particular, the expected impact includes the following:
the creation of new and sound evidence for policy makers in relation to urban food systems in support of policy development;
the building up of political commitment and capacity for multi-objective coordinated strategies, roadmaps and actions between different government departments, jurisdictions and stakeholders that aim at delivering co-benefits relevant to FOOD 2030 priorities;
the creation of a wide network of pilot European cities of different sizes and geographical settings that will develop and implement food system policies and actions including living labs, act as demonstrators of good practice, and become ambassadors for the transferability of the food system model all over Europe and beyond;
the reconnection of citizens with food fostering behavioural change towards healthy sustainable diets and nutrition, responsible production and consumption;
increased food and nutrition security for urban and rural dwellers;
improved social inclusion and equity of all actors of the food systems;
the creation of innovation opportunities, jobs and growth relevant to city region livelihoods and economic development for all actors of the food systems.

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Marine litter is high on the scientific and political agendas and of major concern for European citizens. More than 80 percent of marine litter is plastic. It is estimated that by 2050, more plastic could be in the ocean than fish. It can be found on beaches (mostly produced locally), on the ocean surface, in animals and on the seafloor. Microplastics can get into the food chain, together with the integrated and adsorbed toxins. It is estimated that each year 5 to 13 million tonnes plastics reach the seas and oceans (worldwide), becoming eventually the main source of microplastics. In addition to possible health risks, the damage to marine ecosystems and the blue economy (tourism and other maritime sectors) due to plastic litter are enormous.
Therefore, urgent action is needed both for the prevention and for the removal of existing marine litter, notably plastics and microplastics. For this topic, a demonstration of the removal of marine litter and research is being proposed, highlighting how the environment is impacted by the removal, and the corresponding impacts in terms of ecosystem and economic recovery.
Scope:
The overall goal of this topic is the demonstration of approaches or technologies to improve marine spatial planning and conservation (or even restoration) of coastal ecosystems. More specifically, this topic is for the demonstration of technologies to clean the seafloor and the surface of nearshore waters, and possibly the water column, from historically accumulated plastics and micro-plastics as well as from other accumulated marine litter and the assessment of effectiveness and impact. Accompanying research will have to address impacts on coastal ecosystems’ food chains, biodiversity and functioning, fisheries, aquaculture, Marine Protected Areas, wild life and local economies (all of these) 6, 12, 18 and 24 months after the (start of the) cleaning. At the end of the project, the consortium is expected to identify a way forward and lay the foundations for upscaling with a view to a future potentially automated removal of historically accumulated marine litter (legacy), in particular at hot-spots of accumulated marine litter.
The inclusion of actions to reduce other pollutants and effects of stressors is an advantage.
Projects shall demonstrate the effectiveness of an (or several) automatic or remotely controlled wireless device(s) capable of collecting plastics and other marine litter of reasonable size (larger micro-litter and macro-litter up to a meter or so). The proposed solution must be able to work at the sea surface and on the seafloor/beach. The demonstration has to be for longer periods of time (several months on one site; several sites at the same time are acceptable). The marine litter must be sorted and reused (project must include demonstration of feeding of litter into reuse/recycling chains) in line with the circular economy and the plastics strategy[1] .
The environmental impact, notably on biota, has to be minimized and assessed.
The project must include demonstrations in different sites, including beaches, harbours and shallow seafloor.
This topic is in support of the European Strategy for Plastics in a Circular Economy. Selected projects under this topic as well as projects selected under other topics in H2020 supporting the Plastics Strategy are strongly encouraged to participate in joint activities as appropriate. These joint activities could take the form of clustering of projects, participation in workshops, common exploitation and dissemination etc. The projects should describe how they will be complementary with already existing relevant national activities or other multilateral activities funded by the EU or funded jointly by several Member States. The proposals are expected to demonstrate support to common coordination and dissemination activities. Therefore, the proposals should foresee a dedicated work package for this purpose and earmark appropriate resources. Further details of these coordination activities will be defined during the grant preparation phase with the Commission.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU in the range of EUR 6 million would allow this challenge to be addressed appropriately. This does not preclude the submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
Contributing to the ongoing implementation of EU Policies such as the EU Bioeconomy Strategy, the Circular Economy Strategy, the European Strategy for Plastics in a Circular Economy, the European Integrated Maritime Policy, the Marine Strategy Framework Directive and the UN Sustainable Development Goals, activities will:
In the short-term:
Support the implementation of the UN Nations Decade of Ocean Science for Sustainable Development, and the needs of the Marine Strategy Framework Directive.

Increase availability of efficient and environmentally sustainable technologies to remove existing marine litter.
Contribute to awareness rising of citizens about the importance of prevention to avoid environmental damage and high costs (for the community and the tax payer instead of the polluter).
Contribute to the sustainable management and protection of marine and coastal ecosystems to avoid significant adverse impacts (UN SDG 14).
In the medium-term:
Obtain no more damage from marine litter to the local blue-economy and marine ecosystems services.

Decoupling of plastics production from fossil feedstock is necessary. In addition to the recycled plastics waste, alternative feedstock such as biomass is part of a more resource-efficient, greenhouse gas emission (GHG) neutral solution. The shift towards biomass-sourced plastics will only make sense in the framework of a circular plastics economy where plastics reuse and recycling are maximised. Reuse and recycling of plastics, particularly for some applications such as packaging, remain very low. It has been estimated that globally, about 12 million tonnes of plastics waste per year leak out of the waste management systems and end up in the environment, in particular in the oceans, where it interferes with ecosystem processes and eventually enter the food-feed chain. As regards marine litter, while land-based sources are predominant as a result of land-sea interaction, sea-based sources such as shipping, fishing or aquaculture are also significant. As part of the mitigation efforts, biodegradable or compostable plastics for specific applications such as fishing gear could be a positive development if a clear sustainability framework for biodegradability conditions is provided.
Scope:
Activities shall focus on sustainability strategies and solutions for bio-based productsand support the Plastics Strategy[1]. They shall include innovative product design and business models facilitating efficient reuse and recycling strategies and solutions, including ensuring the safety of recycled materials when used for toys or packaging food stuffs. They shall address the technical and economic barriers to bio-based plastics recycling as regards established and/or alternative recycling options. The risk, impact and solutions to cross-contamination with conventional plastics waste streams or other contaminants shall also be addressed. Additionally, activities shall contribute to building a biodegradable plastics[2] sustainability framework by mapping and focusing on the applications where biodegradable and compostable solutions could support public policies. Work on the biodegradable sustainability framework could include pre-normative research including field tests on land and at sea. Lastly, in line with the requirements of responsible research and innovation, activities shall support the development of international fora and platforms that would facilitate systemic innovation and uptake of results by enabling different actors of the value chains, from industry to civil society and public authorities, to cooperate towards more circularity in the bio-plastics economy. Activities shall build on the results and ongoing developments of EU projects funded under Framework Programmes FP7 and Horizon 2020 as well as on available and on-going standardisation results and activities including work within CEN TC 411 or under ISO. The interdisciplinary and cross-sectorial nature of the proposal should also apply to training activities improving the professional skills and competencies and supporting the creation of new jobs in the blue economy and in the bioeconomy.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU in the range of EUR 9 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed properly. Nonetheless, this does not preclude the submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
Contributing to the implementation of the EU Bioeconomy Strategy, the EU Plastic Strategy, the EU Circular Economy action plan, the EU Marine Strategy Framework Directive, the EU Maritime Spatial Planning Directive, the Energy Union's vision for a low carbon, energy-efficient economy, the EU Blue Growth Strategy and the UN SDGs, activities shall:

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
The EU depends strongly on external sources for the supply of key fertilisers used in agriculture. Resource depletion and an increasing global demand for mineral fertilisers may, in the long term, lead to price tensions with an impact on food security. Mineral-based fertilisation also poses significant environmental problems, linked e.g. to the amounts of fossil energy needed to produce and transport these fertilisers. At the same time, large amounts of minerals are being dispersed in the environment through a large variety of organic waste streams, resulting in soil, water and air pollution. Agri-food specialisation has led to regional imbalances: whilst in some regions a nutrient overabundance is causing severe environmental impacts (e.g. nitrate pollution), other are experiencing nutrient deficits. These contrasting effects may also be observed between locations within the same region.
Several technologies are being developed to recover and re-use nutrients from organic by-products and waste streams, but many are insufficiently mature and the characteristics of end-products do not always match end-user preferences. It is expected that the EU ‘circular economy package’ will boost the emergence and commercialisation of such new fertilisers, hence it is important to understand their agronomic and environmental performance in order to establish adequate policies, guidelines and application rules.
Scope:
Proposals shall address inter-regional and intra-regional imbalances through effective nutrient recovery from by-products of the agri-food or forestry sectors, or from waste water and sewage sludge, and conversion into novel fertilisers.
Proposals should address only one of the following sub-topics:
A.[2018] Understanding properties and impacts of bio-based fertilisers (RIA)
The project shall generate a knowledge basis that could support policy decisions related to novel fertilisers based on organic resources[1]. On the basis of products that are currently available or under development, a comprehensive set of potential environmental impacts shall be identified and assessed across the fertiliser value chain[2], along with criteria related to their agronomic performance, safety and quality. Parameters and reference values shall be proposed as a basis for future policies related to new organic-based fertilisers. The project shall also propose reliable analytical measurement and testing methods for future compliance checks. An analysis of nutrient imbalances between regions in the EU shall be carried out, and the viability and sustainability of nutrient flows between regions through new organic-based fertilisers (including the understanding of logistic costs) shall be assessed.
B.[2019] Bio-based fertilisers from animal manure (IA)
Projects shall demonstrate processes for recovery of mineral nutrients and production of novel fertilisers from animal manure. Proposals shall perform a thorough analysis of the state of the art, and demonstrate that the activities proposed go beyond past or ongoing research, without overlaps. Technologies that are currently under development shall be further improved, and possibly integrated, to produce high quality end-products[3]. Proposals shall address end-product marketability, safety, sustainability including emissions of greenhouse gasses and pollutants, and compliance with relevant EU regulations[4]. Their suitability and acceptability under the organic farming regulatory framework shall also be analysed. An integrated assessment of the business model (economic, agronomic, social and environmental) shall be performed. The whole value chain shall be demonstrated to a near-commercial scale (TRL 6-7). Proposals shall fall under the concept of the 'multi-actor approach'[5] including relevant actors such as agri-food industries, technology providers, research centres, end-users (farmers and farmer associations), or public administration.
C.[2020] Bio-based fertilisers from by-products of the agri-food, fisheries, aquaculture or forestry sectors (IA)
Projects shall demonstrate processes for recovery of mineral nutrients and production of novel fertilisers from by-products of the agri-food, fisheries, aquaculture or forestry sectors, excluding animal manure, water and sewage sludge (covered in scopes B and D). Proposals should demonstrate that the activities proposed go beyond past or ongoing research, without overlaps. Technologies that are currently under development should be further improved, and possibly integrated, to produce high quality end-products[6]. Proposals shall address end product marketability, safety, sustainability including emissions of greenhouse gasses and pollutants, and compliance with relevant EU regulations. Their suitability and acceptability under the organic farming regulatory framework should also be analysed. An integrated assessment of the business model (economic, agronomic, social and environmental) shall be performed. The whole value chain shall be demonstrated to a near-commercial scale (TRL 6-7). Proposals shall fall under the concept of the 'multi-actor approach'[5], including relevant actors such as agri-food industries, technology providers, research centres, end-users (farmers and farmer associations), or public administration.
D.[2020] Bio-based fertilisers from waste water and sewage sludge (RIA)
Projects shall develop techniques for nutrients recovery from waste water streams such as urban and industrial waste water, sewage sludge from waste water treatment plants, brine from water desalination or demineralisation plants[8]. Building on related work under previous research framework programmes and other EU-funded programmes, projects should design and test techniques for nutrients recovery and subsequent mechanical, chemical or biological processes to upgrade recovered nutrients. The monitoring and removal or mitigation of contaminants affecting food safety, human and ecosystem health (e.g. pharmaceuticals in sewage sludge) in recovered nutrients should be key in the process design. A life-cycle assessment should be carried out in order to evaluate the environmental impacts of processes along the whole value chain, including waste/residues, and products’ environmental performances. Regulation issues should be part of the investigation. Involvement of governments at different levels as regards regulation issues, regional/local strategies and territorial development plans is an asset.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU in the range of EUR 6 million for sub-topic A and D and EUR 8 million for sub-topics B and C would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless this does not preclude the submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts. Proposals for sub-topics A, B and C should include a task to cluster with other projects financed under this topic, under topic SFS-39-2019 and - if possible - with other relevant projects in the field funded by Horizon 2020 (including under the BBI JU). For sub-topics B and C, participation of partners from CELAC countries[9] is encouraged.
Expected Impact:
Proposals are expected to provide the technologies needed to develop a new generation of commercial, sustainable and safe fertilisers based on organic by-products, and the scientific knowledge needed to frame their use. This will help to:
set up a coherent policy framework for the sustainable production and use of organic-based fertilisers (sub-topic A);
replace non-renewable mineral fertilisers, hence reducing external dependence and risks related to depletion (sub-topics A, B, C and D);
balance nutrient concentrations between or within regions, thus increasing resource efficiency (sub-topics A, B and C);
reduce the environmental impacts linked to the dispersion of nutrients present in waste flows, to the emissions of greenhouse gases, or to the production of fossil-based fertilisers (sub-topics A, B, C and D);
develop new business models creating value from agri-food, fisheries, aquaculture or forestry by-products (sub-topics B and C) and from water sector and the industrial sector subject to waste water treatment, including desalination or demineralisation plants (sub-topic D).
In the long term, this should contribute to a thriving, sustainable and circular bio-economy, the development of new business models that are synergic with other economic sectors, and therefore to the creation of wealth and quality jobs in rural areas.

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
To boost the development of a bio-based economy in Europe, there is a need for business models that can be replicated easily in a variety of locations and contexts, with relatively low levels of investment, risk and technical sophistication. A wider range of rural entrepreneurs needs to get involved in the emerging bio-based business sector, including farmers, forest owners, their associations, and small rural business. This will help to diversify and revitalise the economy and create quality jobs in rural areas. Local and regional authorities need to do more to support the bio-economy in their respective territories. They should therefore have a range of options to choose from and be able to select the approach that best suits local needs and assets. As a key part of a circular economy, the bioeconomy needs to close loops to make the most efficient possible use of biomass under market and logistical constraints, and to ensure the sustainability of business models.
Scope:
Based on an established agro-food system[1], proposals shall consider a variety of additional bio-based processes and end products that could be integrated into the system, and that are viable on a small scale (farm to rural community level). The TRL of the technologies considered can vary at the start. The project shall test and demonstrate the combination of these in a circular configuration. The integrated system shall achieve a TRL 6-7.
Proposals can target any combination of non-food bio-based outputs, but projects focussing mainly on bio-fuels or bio-energy are not eligible. The choice of feedstock sources shall avoid negative effects on food security[2]. Proposals shall focus on a single agro-food system that should be common in Europe and offer high replication potential, and can be combined with sustainable management of natural areas[3] and/or use of marginal lands. A complete assessment (economic, environmental and social) of the integrated system shall be carried out. The project shall include a business plan[4], and a set of policy options and recommendations.
Proposals shall fall under the concept of the 'multi-actor approach'[5], ensuring solid collaboration between relevant actors such as farmers or farmers associations, agro-food industry (including small businesses), technology providers, research centres or public authorities. Proposals should include a task to cluster with other projects financed under this topic, under topic CE-SFS-36-2020 and – if possible – with other relevant projects in the field that are funded by Horizon 2020 (including under the BBI JU).
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of up to EUR 10 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
Proposed activities will expand the range of business models available to entrepreneurs and local authorities by developing circular and sustainable business models with large potential for replication in areas with unexploited resources, at a relatively low cost, risk and with low levels of technical complexity. This will help to:
expand and diversify the sector by mobilising a wider range of players in the bio-based economy, including small businesses, farmers, forest owners and their associations;
develop regional and local bio-based models adapted to the wide variety of contexts found in the EU, including rural and remote areas and outermost regions;
ensure adequate recovery of nutrients and organic matter, and their reuse in agriculture.
In the longer term results consolidate a diversified, circular and climate-friendly bio-based sector that harnesses regional assets, provides quality jobs and opportunities in rural areas and revitalises rural economies.

","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Conversion of captured CO2, for example using hydrogen made from renewable energy, to produce fuels is not only a means to replace fossil fuels, but also a promising solution for seasonal energy storage. There are still relevant and significant scientific and technological challenges to be able to exploit the CO2 as a chemical and fuel feedstock in a systematic manner, the main challenge being that the chemical utilisation of CO2 is limited by its low energy content, and the conversion process is highly energy intensive.
Scope:
Development of energy-efficient and economically and environmentally viable CO2 conversion technologies for chemical energy storage or displacement of fossil fuels that allow for upscaling in the short to medium term. Projects have to substantiate the potential for the proposed CCU solution(s) as CO2 mitigation option through conducting an LCA in conformity with guidelines developed by the Commission or the relevant ISO standard. Proposals have to define ambitious but achievable targets for energy requirements of the conversion process (including catalytic conversion), production costs and product yields, that will be used to monitor project implementation.
Proposals are expected to bring technologies that have reached at least TRL 3-4 to TRL 5-6 (please see part G of the General Annexes). Technology development has to be accompanied by an assessment of the societal readiness towards the proposed innovations. Relevant end users and societal stakeholders will be identified in the proposal, and their concerns and needs will be analysed during the project using appropriate techniques and methods from the social sciences and humanities, in order to create awareness, gain feedback on societal impact and advancing society’s readiness for the proposed solutions.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU in the range of EUR 3 to 4 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
In line with the strategy for EU international cooperation in research and innovation (COM(2012)497), international cooperation is encouraged, in particular with relevant Mission Innovation[1] countries such as China[2].
Expected Impact:
New solutions for the conversion of captured CO2, either from power plants or from carbon-intensive industry, to useful products such as fuels or chemicals for energy storage (CCU) that will create new markets for innovative industrial sectors, diversify the economic base in carbon-intensive regions, as well as contribute to achieving a Circular Economy.

","04 September 2018","Specific Challenge:
Cities struggle in their transition to implement a full circular economy model incorporating regenerative practices. There is a clear need for cities to become circular in order to alter urban consumption patterns and value chains, and to stimulate innovation, business opportunities, and job creation in both established and newly created sectors. New, more flexible systemic urban planning instruments enabling the design and implementation of circular urban processes would make urban and peri-urban areas regenerative and facilitate their adaptation to emerging economic, social and environmental challenges.
Scope:
Actions should demonstrate how cities[1] can be transformed into centres of circular innovation and stimulate regenerative practices in both urban and peri-urban areas (including the surrounding industrial areas and commercial ports).
Actions should develop and implement innovative urban planning approaches and instruments (e.g. dynamic and semantic 3D real time flexible geospatial data and planning tools, innovative governance and legislation enabling new practices, design approaches, business models, etc.) to support and guide the transition towards circular and regenerative cities in terms of their built environment, public space, urban spatial use and programming. They should demonstrate innovative solutions for closing the loop of urban material and resource flows within the nexus of water, energy, food, air, ecosystem services, soil, biomass, waste/wastewater, recyclables and materials and for supporting an increase in the regenerative capacity of the city while limiting pollution of the environment, for example by reducing the emissions of air pollutants. At the same time, these solutions should ensure sound management of trade-offs and synergies among and across sectors. They should include ways of sustainably reusing and (mixed-use) reprogramming of existing buildings, open spaces and (infra)structures. The action should actively involve public authorities, societal stakeholders and community-based partners such as city-makers, urban (fab-) labs, urban planners, (urban) designers, cultural & creative organisations, and start-ups in close collaboration with the cities to find practical and durable solutions.
In addition actions should develop and implement innovative local governance structures and networks to enhance circular economy innovation in the urban fabric and help prioritise flexible implementation of urban space programming for circular initiatives. Actions should enable the continuous monitoring and optimisation of “urban metabolic” processes and rapid management interventions, where needed, deploying new indicators enabling easy assessment, comparison and sharing of best practice on the ground as well as digital solutions comprising networks of sensors, big data, geo-localisation, observational programmes such as Copernicus and GEOSS, satellite navigation and positioning services offered by EGNOS/Galileo, and citizens’ observatories.
Actions are expected to establish long-term sustainable data platforms securing open, consistent data on the impacts of the deployed approaches, and to ensure interoperability of relevant data infrastructures for effective communication, public consultation, and exchange of experiences.
An interdisciplinary approach, including the participation of applied natural sciences, social sciences and humanities disciplines (such as behavioural economics, gender studies, urban planning and governance) is considered crucial to properly address the complex challenges of this topic.
Proposals should pay attention to the special call conditions for this topic. In grants awarded under this topic, costs for construction and installation of “infrastructure-targeted” interventions shall not constitute more than 20% of the total eligible costs. Beneficiaries’ own resources and/or mobilisation and leverage of additional investments beyond Horizon 2020, whether private or public, should make up the remaining investment costs and should secure economic and financial sustainability for the execution of the project.
To enhance the impact and promote upscaling and replication of these solutions, actions should engage in substantial networking and training activities to disseminate their experience, knowledge and deployment practices to cities that are planning to design and implement similar solutions in a successive phase beyond the duration of the project. To enhance impact, cooperation and synergies with the activities undertaken within the Global Covenant of Mayors for Climate and Energy initiative, and in particular the regional component for Europe[2](supported by the EC) should be sought where appropriate.
Furthermore, actions should envisage resources for clustering with other ongoing and future projects on sustainable cities through nature-based solutions funded under the 'Smart and Sustainable Cities' call in part 17 of the 2016-2017 Work Programme as well as under the topics SC5-20-2019 and SC5-14-2019 of this Work Programme. They should also ensure that there will be no duplication with work undertaken by relevant projects funded under the topic 'CO-CREATION-02-2016 - User-driven innovation: value creation through design-enabled innovation'.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU in the range of EUR 10 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
The project results are expected to contribute to:
measurable reduction of materials, natural resource consumption and environmental footprint in urban and peri-urban areas;
measurable increase of the regenerative capacity of urban and peri-urban areas due to a measurable increase in material and natural resource creation in cities, as well as increased productivity through maximisation of (multi)-functional use and programming of urban spaces;
set of social behavioural, economic, environmental performance and geospatial indicators to monitor and assess the urban and peri-urban circularity and regenerative capacity;
local governance innovation in response to the needs and concerns of stakeholders and the affected public as well as boosted creativity and entrepreneurship related to circularity and regenerative processes;
the implementation of the EU Circular Economy Action Plan with a direct link to the urban fabric (built and public space), and the Habitat III New Urban Agenda's commitment to transition to a circular economy.

","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
In order to secure the sustainable access to primary and secondary raw materials, including metals, industrial minerals, construction raw materials, wood, and particularly Critical Raw Materials (CRMs) for the EU economy, there is a need to tackle a number of specific non-technological challenges at local, regional, national, EU and global levels.
Illegal shipments of waste, both within the EU and to non-EU countries, and poor recycling have adverse effects on human health and the environment, create unfair competition for law abiding operators and give rise to the loss of valuable resources in the case of poor or no treatment. However, port authorities and enforcement authorities have limited resources to control the ever increasing amount of material shipped and this without blocking normal traffic. In addition, at the moment there is no distinction in customs codes between “new goods” and “second hand goods” which implies that illegal waste shipments are often disguised as “second hand goods”.
Currently, at most only one third of waste wood is recycled, the rest being landfilled or incinerated and there are great differences between Member States in wood recycling performance. Increasing production costs combined with stagnating product prices in recent years have put pressure on the profit margins of the EU woodworking industries, mostly dominated by SMEs. There is a need for higher resource efficiency and increased use of recycled wood in wood processing that can provide measurable improvements in company profitability.
Requirements for responsible sourcing in the raw materials value chain have recently been strengthened in one aspect by the new EU Conflict Minerals legislation. However, the need for the industry to engage in responsible sourcing and responsible business conduct and to perform relevant due diligence goes beyond legislative obligations – it is rooted in the growing expectations of consumers, civil society, governments and procurement managers (buyers). While it is very difficult for individual operators to meet such expectations due to the limited availability of the necessary information, downstream industries increasingly require all operators in their supply chain to address risks by performing due diligence. Responsible sourcing of raw materials is becoming a new business reality; in the short term it may offer a competitive advantage to frontrunners and in the long term, it could become a necessary ""license to operate"" and, given the global character of today's supply chains, it is also a way to be integrated in global supply chains.
Scope:
All actions should contribute to building the EU knowledge base of primary and secondary raw materials (EC Raw Materials Information System – RMIS[1]).
In support of the EIP on Raw Materials actions should envisage clustering activities with other relevant selected projects for cross-projects co-operation, consultations and joint activities on cross-cutting issues and share of results as well as participating in joint meetings and communication events. To this end proposals should foresee a dedicated work package and/or task, and earmark the appropriate resources accordingly.
Actions should address only one of the following sub-topics[2]:
a) Voluntary scheme for certification of treatment facilities for key types of wastes (2018): Actions should develop and launch a voluntary scheme for certification – including verification – of treatment facilities for key types of waste/recyclates containing significant amounts of critical raw materials (e.g. electronic waste and/or waste batteries). The scheme should integrate measurable and verifiable minimum quality standards and a verification procedure based on traceability through the supply chain from collection to end-processing. Participation of relevant stakeholders – including waste holders, dealers, brokers and operators of treatment facilities – from the conception phase of the scheme should be ensured. Full compliance with applicable WTO rules and with the rules and principles of the Basel Convention should be ensured, and existing certification schemes for waste should be taken into account.
In line with the strategy for EU international cooperation in research and innovation (COM(2012)497), international cooperation is encouraged.
The Commission considers that for this sub-topic, proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of up to EUR 2 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
b) Resource efficiency in wood processing, recovery and recycling (2018): Actions should identify, assess and document existing practices in a representative set of EU Member States/Associated Countries and possibly third countries, and create a network to widely disseminate and transfer good practices covering both issues: resource-efficient wood processing and wood waste recycling. Resource-efficient wood processing in the woodworking sector should improve companies' operational performance and hence the EU sector's overall competitiveness. Quality-oriented and cost-efficient wood waste collection systems, sorting and recycling, and design solutions should facilitate increased wood recycling together with increased product quality and market acceptance of recovered wood in new products. Involvement of relevant stakeholders across value chains is necessary, including wood processing industries, research & innovation institutes, woodworking products end-users, municipalities and other parties dealing with wood waste collection, sorting and recycling. Actions should also assess trade-offs between wood waste use for material and energy. This assessment should be based on life cycle analysis and all sustainability pillars, and consider impacts on sustainable forest operations and ecosystems integrity (for all major EU forest regions) and impacts of intra-EU trade[3]. Proposals should include the participation of industrial SMEs, as far as possible.
The Commission considers that for this sub-topic, proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of up to EUR 3 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
c) Responsible sourcing of raw materials in global value chains (2019): Actions should create a global business and stakeholder platform for exchange of information and the promotion of responsible sourcing and responsible business conduct involving a network of key international experts and stakeholders. The aim is to engage governmental and corporate partners from the EU/Associated Countries and third countries in developing a globally acceptable concept of a responsible sourcing in minerals and metals value chains.
The platform should develop ideas for creating incentives for responsible sourcing in raw materials value chains, strengthen EU outreach to third countries to promote the concept in intergovernmental forums and to establish responsible sourcing in EU business practice. Interaction with other related existing platforms, networks and initiatives is encouraged. Actions should consider the relevant aspects related to environmental sustainability.
In line with the strategy for EU international cooperation in research and innovation (COM(2012)497), international cooperation is encouraged, particularly with partners from advanced countries using raw materials[2].
The Commission considers that for this sub-topic, proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of up to EUR 3 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
The project results are expected to contribute to:
sub-topic a)
achieving the objectives and the implementation of both the Raw Materials Initiative[5] and the EIP on Raw Materials, in particular in terms of strengthening the enforcement of the Waste Shipment Regulation and improving access to critical raw materials (CRMs);
increased recovery rates in the EU as regards key types of waste/recyclates containing significant amounts of CRMs;
in the longer term, reduced EU dependency on imports of CRMs;
creating added value and new jobs in metallurgy, equipment manufacturing and/or downstream industries;
improving the environmental (control of emissions, residues, effluents), health and safety performance of operations throughout the whole life cycle;
sub-topic b)
achieving the objectives and the implementation of the EU Forest Strategy[6], Circular Economy Action Plan and the EIP on Raw Materials on resource-efficient use of resources;
improving knowledge and conditions for efficient wood processing when compared to the state of the art, resulting in increased competitiveness of the EU woodworking industries;
increased wood waste recycling across the EU (including from furniture, construction and demolition, packaging, household) and increased acceptance in the use of secondary wood;
better informed decision-making at EU, national and local levels in the private and public sectors on wood recycling and resource efficiency; and improved knowledge of EU stakeholders about proposed solutions, including authorities involved in wood recycling;
in the medium and long term, creating added value and new jobs and increasing the overall competitiveness of the EU woodworking industries and related value-chains through an uptake of resource-, water- and energy-efficient solutions;
sub-topic c)
achieving the objectives of both the Raw Materials Initiative[5] and the EIP on Raw Materials in terms of the access and responsible sourcing of raw materials;
improved awareness of consumers/corporates and improved perception of responsible sourcing as a source of competitive advantage through more responsible sourcing and responsible business conduct initiatives with regards to raw materials;
increased visibility of responsible sourcing in global political agenda-setting and emergence of a globally accepted definition of responsible sourcing.

","14 November 2018
","04 September 2019","Specific Challenge:
There is a growing demand for water from various economic activities and increasing stress on natural water sources. To secure water for our society, there is therefore a need to make available alternative water resources of various qualities and which are appropriate for different functions and multiple users, and to better exploit water resources and all the valuable substances that could be obtained through the wastewater treatment and reuse process. However, innovations in this domain remain fragmented and/or only experimented at small scales; testing and deployment in operational environments and at scales suitable for encouraging wider uptake is still missing.
Scope:
Actions should demonstrate the feasibility of a 'water smart' economy and society in which all available water resources, including surface, groundwater, waste water, and process water, are managed in such a way as to avoid water scarcity and pollution, increase resilience to climate change, appropriately manage water-related risks, and ensure that all valuable substances that could be obtained from waste water treatment processes, or are embedded in used water streams, are recovered.
Actions should address only one of the following sub-topics:
a) Symbiosis between industry and water utilities: Actions should demonstrate resource-efficient solutions derived from the systemic exploitation of symbiotic inter-linkages between wastewater treatment in industry and by water utilities. These might address, for instance, the reuse of treated wastewater, the use of substances or energy derived from wastewater treatment, or might demonstrate the concept of dynamic allocation of the right quality of water for the right purpose, while ensuring health and safety. Innovative solutions do not need to be only technological, but may also encompass other types of innovation such as innovative governance and stakeholder engagement or business models in industrial environments.
b) Large scale applications with multiple water users at various relevant scales: Actions should test and demonstrate systemic innovation in real life, large scale operational environments. Actions should address multiple water users (urban, industrial, rural and agricultural) and various relevant scales (regional/national/international) for:
stimulating efficient and multiple use, recycling and reuse of water; recovery of energy and materials (such as nutrients, minerals, chemicals and metals) from water;
managing water demand and efficient allocation;
exploiting alternative water sources;
prevention of water pollution and degradation of the aquatic environment and soil; and
cost-effective and smart management of the water system and infrastructure.
As far as possible, the innovative solutions should include all of the above-mentioned activities. Actions should also consider: new marketing and financing concepts and strategies to maximise the multiple values of water and increase the attractiveness of the water sector for investors; new governance approaches and decision-making instruments for water managers; water systems vulnerability approaches and other sustainability assessments (e.g. footprint, Life Cycle Assessment).
The participation of social sciences and humanities, also addressing the gender dimension, is considered crucial to properly address the complex challenges of this topic, especially those related to human behaviour and attitudes towards water, the inter-linkages between policy and implementation, and acceptance of the solutions developed by both the public and other water users.
For both sub-topics, deployment of enabling digital solutions for the monitoring, control and optimisation of data and processes is also encouraged. Where appropriate, related regulatory and institutional barriers which prevent the wide application of developed innovative solutions should be addressed. Where technological innovation is concerned, TRL 5-7 should be achieved. To assure applicability and wide deployment of the innovative water technologies in different conditions (including different water resources, economic, social and regulatory settings) involvement of market take-up partners and/or end users from a wide range of different European regions is strongly encouraged, as well as SME participation.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 10 million and EUR 15 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
The project results are expected to contribute to:
significantly reduced use of water from freshwater sources;
improved recovery and use of resources (materials and water itself), including energy;
mobilisation of water-related investments and synergies with other funding instruments.
the creation of new business opportunities and increased competiveness of EU industries;
supporting, as appropriate, the implementation of EU water policies, the transition to a more circular economy at different scales and economic and social conditions[1], water security, water use efficiency, enhanced resilience to climate change and achievement of the relevant Sustainable Development Goals;
the implementation of the objectives of the EIP Water and, where appropriate, supporting the implementation and evaluation of technology verification schemes, including the EU Environmental Technology Verification Pilot (ETV) programme.

The increasing resources' constraints that EU is facing strongly condition its competitiveness and the quality of life of individuals. Important gains in resource efficiency can be made by replacing current linear economic models with circular models of production and consumption, which result, at the same time, in a substantial reduction of GHG emissions. While relying on industrial leadership, the success of circular economy models will depend on adopting a systemic approach to eco-innovation that encompasses value and supply chains in their entirety and engages all actors involved in such chains. A systemic approach entails foresight of the diverse impacts that transformative innovative solutions can have on the economy, environment and society at large. Side-effects of innovative practices can thus be addressed, e.g. change in energy policy due to a reduction of waste available for energy recovery. Bringing end-users closer to the design and production phases, and customising the production and delivery of goods and associated services can boost new consumption patterns that add greater value and reduce over-production, waste and other negative environmental impacts. The involvement of end-users in designing circular economic models that better respond to their needs can enable the development of value-added solutions and act as a driver for Europe's re-industrialisation.
Scope:
Proposals shall address one of the following issues:
a) Design for circular value and supply chains (2016): Through large scale demonstration projects, organisations, including from process and manufacturing industries and SMEs, whether dealing with biotic and/or abiotic resources, are expected to test and showcase circular economy solutions based on re-design of value and supply chains, taking into account products, production processes, and/or systems, as well as involving final users. Such solutions should entail the environmentally sustainable recovery, recycling and/or re-use of resources and energy flows, including by cross-sectorial symbiosis, within the overall chain from resources to marketed products.
The proposals should enable entrepreneurs, industries and researchers to collectively implement the innovative solutions at an appropriate scale, which goes beyond a single production plant. They should develop new forms of organisation and governance within and across value and supply chain(s), considering where appropriate collaboration between public and private sectors. The proposals should include an outline business plan which can be developed further in the course of the project.
Where relevant, projects are expected to contribute to the implementation of the SPIRE PPP Roadmap.
For the technological innovation components, TRL 5-7 are to be aimed for (as defined in the General Annexes of this Work Programme). The EU Environmental Technology Verification (ETV) pilot programme[1] could be used to verify the performance of innovative technologies at higher TRLs.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 7 million and EUR 10 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
b) Systemic services for the circular economy (2017): To demonstrate through large scale projects the economic and environmental feasibility of circular economic business models that underpin new services based on performance/functionality rather than ownership, and/or on mass customisation, including through supporting demand side measures. Proposals should adopt a systemic eco-innovative approach addressing all forms of innovation, combining technological, organisational, societal, cultural and behavioural innovation, and strengthening the participation of civil society. Such an approach can foster new forms of collaboration between end-users, producers and researchers. In particular proposals should consider ways of supporting co-creation by developing, experimenting and demonstrating new business models together with end-users, taking into consideration their needs, including gender dimension, thus enabling the development of value adding solutions. Business models that foster new services and consumption and production patterns will require support to end-users in the transition to the circular economy by raising awareness and knowledge sharing activities on circular economy models. The proposals should include an outline business plan which can be developed further in the course of the project.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 4 million and EUR 7 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
For both: Within the projects funded, additional or follow-up funding should be sought, be it private or public, so as to achieve a more effective implementation and deployment at larger scale and scope of the innovative solutions addressed. Additional funding sources could include relevant regional/national schemes under the European Structural and Investment Funds (ESIF), such as under the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF), or other relevant funds such as the Instrument for Pre-accession Assistance (IPA II). In the latter case, contacts could be established with the funds managing body during the duration of the projects. In case of relevance for the Research and Innovation Smart Specialisation Strategies, the project proposals could already indicate which interested regions/countries have been pre-identified. Please note, however, that reference to such additional or follow-up funding will not lead automatically to a higher score in the evaluation of the proposal.
Within the projects funded, possible regulatory barriers should also be addressed, as appropriate. In particular 'Innovation Deals' may be proposed. By 'Innovation Deal' a bottom-up approach to address regulatory bottlenecks to innovation is understood, that would take the form of voluntary agreements, with the European Commission and external stakeholders, with the aim of identifying and overcoming regulatory barriers and thus facilitating the market up-take of innovative solutions.
A life cycle thinking and assessment, in line with the recommendations and reference data from the European Platform on Life Cycle Assessment[2] when applicable, should be applied.
Expected Impact:
a) The testing and demonstration of circular value and supply chains, within cross sectorial, collaborative systemic approaches is expected to make measurable contributions in the medium term to:
substantially improving the efficient use of resources in Europe, leading to significant reduction of adverse environmental impacts, including on climate change, and to optimisation of production;
substantially reducing the generation of residual waste, by applying the principles of the waste hierarchy (as set in the Waste Framework Directive[3]), compared to current best practice;
creating new business opportunities for industry and SMEs in the EU, including in manufacturing, contributing to the exploitation of EU innovative solutions, and improving the competitiveness of European enterprises in the global market for eco-innovative solutions;
demonstrating the economic, social, and environmental sustainability of the proposed approaches and main elements that a business plan should include in order to realise them, including the assessment of possible positive and negative side-effects and risks, such as those associated with harmful substances potentially present in recycled materials;
providing evidence-based knowledge for enabling framework conditions (such as the regulatory or policy framework) that facilitate a broader transition to the circular economy in the EU.
b) The testing and demonstrating of circular economic business models and services, including logistics and ICT capabilities, based on performance/functionality enhancement, is expected to measurably contribute in the medium term to:
creating markets for new products/services (e.g. leasing or 'sharing' practices) which empower end-users in their choice for more sustainable consumption patterns, and require the implementation of innovative producer responsibility or other sectorial or cross-sectorial governance schemes;
enabling the development of new approaches for designing products/services that collectively consider end-users, brand owners, as well as entrepreneurs, and researchers, and deliver the needs of end-users;
reducing supply chain length, thus increasing resource efficiency and reducing adverse impacts on the environment, including on climate change;
facilitating the inclusion of resource or materials criteria in designing products/services (e.g. durability, reparability and recyclability), thus contributing to an increase in resource and energy efficiency, and reduced environmental impacts, in the whole life cycle of products;
creating new business opportunities for industry and SMEs in the EU, contributing to the exploitation of EU innovative solutions, and improving the competitiveness of European enterprises in the global market for eco-innovative solutions;
demonstrating the economic, social, cultural and environmental sustainability of the proposed approaches and main elements that a business plan should include in order to realise them, including the assessment of possible positive and negative side-effects and risks, such as those associated with harmful substances potentially present in recycled materials;
providing evidence-based knowledge regarding the enabling framework conditions (such as the regulatory or policy framework or cultural factors) that facilitate a broader transition to a circular economy in the EU;
implementing the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), in particular SDG 12 'Ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns', as well as the conclusions of the COP21 Paris Agreement[4].

Proposals shall address one of the following issues:
a) Design for circular value and supply chains (2016): Through large scale demonstration projects, organisations, including from process and manufacturing industries and SMEs, whether dealing with biotic and/or abiotic resources, are expected to test and showcase circular economy solutions based on re-design of value and supply chains, taking into account products, production processes, and/or systems, as well as involving final users. Such solutions should entail the environmentally sustainable recovery, recycling and/or re-use of resources and energy flows, including by cross-sectorial symbiosis, within the overall chain from resources to marketed products.
The proposals should enable entrepreneurs, industries and researchers to collectively implement the innovative solutions at an appropriate scale, which goes beyond a single production plant. They should develop new forms of organisation and governance within and across value and supply chain(s), considering where appropriate collaboration between public and private sectors. The proposals should include an outline business plan which can be developed further in the course of the project.
Where relevant, projects are expected to contribute to the implementation of the SPIRE PPP Roadmap.
For the technological innovation components, TRL 5-7 are to be aimed for (as defined in the General Annexes of this Work Programme). The EU Environmental Technology Verification (ETV) pilot programme[1] could be used to verify the performance of innovative technologies at higher TRLs.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 7 million and EUR 10 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
b) Systemic services for the circular economy (2017): To demonstrate through large scale projects the economic and environmental feasibility of circular economic business models that underpin new services based on performance/functionality rather than ownership, and/or on mass customisation, including through supporting demand side measures. Proposals should adopt a systemic eco-innovative approach addressing all forms of innovation, combining technological, organisational, societal, cultural and behavioural innovation, and strengthening the participation of civil society. Such an approach can foster new forms of collaboration between end-users, producers and researchers. In particular proposals should consider ways of supporting co-creation by developing, experimenting and demonstrating new business models together with end-users, taking into consideration their needs, including gender dimension, thus enabling the development of value adding solutions. Business models that foster new services and consumption and production patterns will require support to end-users in the transition to the circular economy by raising awareness and knowledge sharing activities on circular economy models. The proposals should include an outline business plan which can be developed further in the course of the project.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 4 million and EUR 7 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
For both: Within the projects funded, additional or follow-up funding should be sought, be it private or public, so as to achieve a more effective implementation and deployment at larger scale and scope of the innovative solutions addressed. Additional funding sources could include relevant regional/national schemes under the European Structural and Investment Funds (ESIF), such as under the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF), or other relevant funds such as the Instrument for Pre-accession Assistance (IPA II). In the latter case, contacts could be established with the funds managing body during the duration of the projects. In case of relevance for the Research and Innovation Smart Specialisation Strategies, the project proposals could already indicate which interested regions/countries have been pre-identified. Please note, however, that reference to such additional or follow-up funding will not lead automatically to a higher score in the evaluation of the proposal.
Within the projects funded, possible regulatory barriers should also be addressed, as appropriate. In particular 'Innovation Deals' may be proposed. By 'Innovation Deal' a bottom-up approach to address regulatory bottlenecks to innovation is understood, that would take the form of voluntary agreements, with the European Commission and external stakeholders, with the aim of identifying and overcoming regulatory barriers and thus facilitating the market up-take of innovative solutions.
A life cycle thinking and assessment, in line with the recommendations and reference data from the European Platform on Life Cycle Assessment[2] when applicable, should be applied.
Expected Impact:
a) The testing and demonstration of circular value and supply chains, within cross sectorial, collaborative systemic approaches is expected to make measurable contributions in the medium term to:
substantially improving the efficient use of resources in Europe, leading to significant reduction of adverse environmental impacts, including on climate change, and to optimisation of production;
substantially reducing the generation of residual waste, by applying the principles of the waste hierarchy (as set in the Waste Framework Directive[3]), compared to current best practice;
creating new business opportunities for industry and SMEs in the EU, including in manufacturing, contributing to the exploitation of EU innovative solutions, and improving the competitiveness of European enterprises in the global market for eco-innovative solutions;
demonstrating the economic, social, and environmental sustainability of the proposed approaches and main elements that a business plan should include in order to realise them, including the assessment of possible positive and negative side-effects and risks, such as those associated with harmful substances potentially present in recycled materials;
providing evidence-based knowledge for enabling framework conditions (such as the regulatory or policy framework) that facilitate a broader transition to the circular economy in the EU.
b) The testing and demonstrating of circular economic business models and services, including logistics and ICT capabilities, based on performance/functionality enhancement, is expected to measurably contribute in the medium term to:
creating markets for new products/services (e.g. leasing or 'sharing' practices) which empower end-users in their choice for more sustainable consumption patterns, and require the implementation of innovative producer responsibility or other sectorial or cross-sectorial governance schemes;
enabling the development of new approaches for designing products/services that collectively consider end-users, brand owners, as well as entrepreneurs, and researchers, and deliver the needs of end-users;
reducing supply chain length, thus increasing resource efficiency and reducing adverse impacts on the environment, including on climate change;
facilitating the inclusion of resource or materials criteria in designing products/services (e.g. durability, reparability and recyclability), thus contributing to an increase in resource and energy efficiency, and reduced environmental impacts, in the whole life cycle of products;
creating new business opportunities for industry and SMEs in the EU, contributing to the exploitation of EU innovative solutions, and improving the competitiveness of European enterprises in the global market for eco-innovative solutions;
demonstrating the economic, social, cultural and environmental sustainability of the proposed approaches and main elements that a business plan should include in order to realise them, including the assessment of possible positive and negative side-effects and risks, such as those associated with harmful substances potentially present in recycled materials;
providing evidence-based knowledge regarding the enabling framework conditions (such as the regulatory or policy framework or cultural factors) that facilitate a broader transition to a circular economy in the EU;
implementing the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), in particular SDG 12 'Ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns', as well as the conclusions of the COP21 Paris Agreement[4].

","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
The circular economy holds high potential to contribute to sustainable economic growth and resource efficiency. To capitalise on this potential, appropriate business models are required that can respond to the specific characteristics of the circular economy, in particular in terms of altering value chains, consumption patterns, producer-consumer relationships and financing needs. Furthermore, these business models need to address the issues of trust and traceability. This includes ensuring environmentally, economically and ethically secure sources of materials as well as ensuring that incentives are appropriately distributed throughout the entire supply chain.
Circular economy business models and improved knowledge thereof need to be developed and disseminated to enable entrepreneurs, industries, and business sectors to work together effectively and to make the transition towards the circular economy. In order to make this transition permanent and sustainable, it is of great importance to integrate public policy-making and business decision-making into the development and analysis of best practices, and their subsequent uptake and scaling-up of circular economy business models.
Scope:
Proposals should establish the baseline and facilitate better understanding of the relevant factors which stimulate or hinder successful implementation of circular economy business models. In addition, the underpinning economics leading to further development and future implementation of business models that facilitate the transition towards a circular economy, should be investigated together with the potential of these business models to achieve wider social sustainability benefits, including job creation potential, especially in SMEs. These activities should be based on the identification of drivers and barriers through existing initiatives, programmes, or concrete cases of already successfully applied circular economy business models or selected sectors which have high potential for a transition to the circular economy. All relevant actors and entire chains of production and use should be taken into account. The selected concrete cases or sectors should be sufficient in number to derive generic recommendations at EU level and relevant to support Europe's re-industrialisation, and the Commission’s initiatives in the field of Industry 2020, Internet of Things, the Digital Single Market and Resource Efficiency. Recommendations should be provided in support of policy making, and for future implementation or replication of developed circular economy business models.
Smart, data-driven ICT environments that can contribute to enabling a new generation of business models that maximise performance and added value to the customer, could be also considered, for example sharing, leasing, remanufacturing and new forms of cooperative or social enterprises.
The project activities should aim to attract interest from public and private organisations; the engagement of policy and decision makers should be envisaged; the involvement of scientific actors and business- and higher economic education schools is encouraged in the selection and analysis of cases. Projects should provide an effective mechanism to promote and pave the way for enabling education about and in support of and implementation of business models for the circular economy in a consistent and sustainable manner.
Proposals should consider a systemic approach in business models, applying economic, technological, social, financial, governance, Corporate Social Responsibility and regulatory innovation and embed a strong focus on design, interaction and distribution of value across all actors in a value chain and/or value network.
The activities should take into account and liaise with, where appropriate, other EU past and present projects and initiatives in the field such as the research and education programs of the relevant Knowledge and Innovation Communities (KICs) of the European Institute for Innovation & Technology (EIT) – namely the Climate-KIC, the EIT Raw Materials and the upcoming KIC on Added-value manufacturing (to be launched in 2016).
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU in the range EUR 3 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
The project results are expected to contribute to:
recognition by industry and policy makers of the role that business models can play in the circular economy;
establishing a practice of co-design and replication of new circular economy business models, linking business development and policy making, based on the trans-disciplinary research outcomes on drivers and barriers also in sectors not yet engaged in the circular economy;
better application and replication of applied research and innovation outcomes through enhanced exchange of information, experience, and best practice on circular economy business models and policy making in support thereof between policy makers, businesses, academics, business and higher economic education schools, practitioners, and regional development organisations;
enabling circular businesses to overcome barriers originating from dominant market structures of the linear economy, and reinforcing the shift in consumption, production and value chain operation with effective cooperation mechanisms;
Europe's sustainable transition towards a circular economy;
increased dissemination among relevant communities of circular economy-related best practices in business development, financial instruments, scaling up activities and policy making.

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Waste production, processing and disposal are increasing challenges for urban areas. In this context, local biorefineries can use waste from surrounding industries and municipalities in a symbiotic manner. Today, there are very few examples of facilities that can convert the biodegradable fraction of municipal solid waste and sewage sludge into anything other than compost and energy. Further innovations in urban waste management schemes could contribute to better collection and processing of waste for the production of higher value bio-based products, including for example bio-based chemicals and bio-plastics.
Scope:
Catalogue proven and emerging innovations in the collection, processing and use of organic urban waste and sewage sludge, and on that basis identify potential new value chains. Create and support a platform of regional, municipal and local stakeholders, including public authorities, civil society, and industry (the waste management industry, as well as industries that produce organic waste and those that may have an interest using such waste as a resource). Identify technological and regulatory barriers that hinder the use of more biodegradable waste as raw material for higher value bio-based products, and carry out targeted research that would help to address specific barriers. Such research could contribute to the generation of information required for the development of end-of-waste criteria for urban organic waste.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU in the range of EUR 3 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
To enable the creation of new value chains for higher value purposes other than just for compost or energy, proposals will have to show how to:
Contribute to new developments in strategy and policy at regional and local level for the innovative use of urban organic waste.
Boost investments in the local and regional economy supporting sustainable growth, development and employment;
Facilitate the exchange of information and sharing of experiences among local and regional bioeconomy stakeholders on the production of bio-based products from urban organic waste. In particular, provide inputs to tackle related regulatory gaps and obstacles.

","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Creativity, entrepreneurial skills, risk taking adaptability and innovation capacity, problem solving skills, skills related to effective teamwork and sharing information and knowledge, may all be key competitive advantages for Europeans, starting from young children. To make the best of this potential, it is essential that schools and educational institutions, as well as non-formal ways of learning, empower Europe’s young innovators with the skills they need from early on in life. Empowering the young through skills for innovation and entrepreneurship, including social entrepreneurship, is particularly important to building more inclusive societies giving opportunities to all, including young innovators from less privileged backgrounds or those with disabilities in order to address inequalities.
The challenge to be addressed by this topic is to improve learning and teaching in innovation-related skills for young boys and girls at the age of primary and secondary education through the design and piloting of new innovative ways of skills education, including technologies, processes and relations.
Scope:
New approaches for educating skills need to be developed, piloted and scaled up. There is a lack of sufficient collaboration with entrepreneurial stakeholders in teaching and students practice, and a lack of inter-generational learning. Young people need to be supported with tools, resources and an open environment encouraging experimentation and the development of joint projects including based on interdisciplinary approaches. Effective supporting schemes should guide young people into their entrepreneurial journey.
Building upon existing initiatives in Europe, the consortia (which shall include entrepreneurial partners, and may include partners from civil society and the social economy) shall develop new approaches and innovative models for skills education targeted at young people.
The involvement of young people in the activities of the consortium (not just as recipients of the outputs) is essential. This may include new inter-active methods and new pedagogical modules that will be easily accessible and part of an open platform, which will aim to reach out to thousands of schools and learning sites across Europe. The innovative schemes and new modules will enable the young, future innovators, to develop new capabilities and experimentation attitudes and turn their ideas into successful entrepreneurial and social projects[1].
Promising new models combining technologies with organisational change and building new participatory relations in learning processes - can be tested and adapted in different regions. The innovative models shall be piloted through the schools and/or other businesses and communities, providing young people with a practical set of creative and entrepreneurial skills that will open them up to a world of new possibilities and future jobs.
Within the scope of the action is to develop new models, to investigate and to test new mechanisms that the young generation is engaging in, for addressing societal challenges coupled with an entrepreneurial spirit as well as effective ways and mechanisms for collecting and promoting innovative ideas from the young people. Particular attention should be paid to gender issues.
The action should take into account and coordinate with, where appropriate, with other EU and national initiatives in the field, such as those supported in the context of Erasmus+ strategic partnerships and policy experimentation.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU in the order of EUR 2.5 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. This does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
The action will pave the way for innovating learning and teaching practices, so that innovation skills are part of a person's education, formal and informal, at schools and interacting communities as well as on-line. This will boost innovation and entrepreneurship capacity, bringing together many stakeholders including from education, traditional business, the social and service economy and volunteering schemes. It will thereby empower young innovators across Europe, provide for innovative business models and give them tools to engage in society and channel their energies to create opportunities for the future. In the long run the topic contributes to higher youth employment and to creating new markets and new jobs.
The knowledge generated as a result of the actions should be disseminated across Europe to benefit the largest numbers of young innovators.

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
With competitiveness being increasingly based on intangibles and a mix of products and services that respond to users' needs, applying design thinking, tools and methods can improve performance and efficiency in the commercial and public sector. Design-enabled innovation can be considered as a prominent example of ""user-driven"" innovation, where user involvement in the process is central, as in many cases innovation can better succeed through co-creation. User-centred design thinking and the application of design tools and methods, when applied to services, systems and organisations, enable structured service and business-model innovation, organisational innovation as well as other intangible forms of innovation. The focus is on applying design tools and methods, since this offers a systematic approach to conceive user-driven innovations.
The specific challenge to be addressed by this topic is that many public sector organisations and businesses, especially SMEs, miss out on the potential to utilise design as a source for improving efficiency and stimulating growth.
Scope:
The consortium should plan and run a European pilot including selecting and allocating funding primarily to the concept development phase of the selected projects. Aspects of inclusiveness and social objectives of addressing inequalities in citizens' access to the innovations should be taken into account. The pilot should build on national and European level actions on design, incorporating a robust selection process to ensure that projects selected are likely to be further developed and implemented beyond the concept phase. The emphasis should be on practical experimentation, piloting and demonstrating activities as well as concept testing and incubating to improve organisations' processes, services, products or business models in the private, public or third sectors. Drawing on the experience of the funded projects, the pilot will a) gather data and metrics concerning the impact of design-related policies and programmes in terms of user benefit and business impact, b) develop a transferable methodology to evaluate the effectiveness of design in the innovation process, c) develop a methodology on how actors in different sectors can better connect with design-enabled innovation to increase efficiency and competitiveness in their respective sectors as well as a common impact evaluation methodology and respective indicators, to be applied across sectors and scalable to organisational, regional, national and European level. The activities could also involve showcasing success stories and disseminating the accumulated knowledge, particularly illustrating the applicability and potential of design-enabled innovation for all sectors, be they public or private or commercial or non-commercial activities.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU in the order of EUR 4 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. This does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
This action allows for the provision of financial support to third parties in line with the conditions set out in Part K of the General Annexes to the Work Programme.
Expected Impact:
Robust and commonly accepted guidance on embedding design in value-creating networks and identification of barriers and enablers;
Creation of data, data sets and metrics to evaluate impact regardless of sector;
The methodology developed and the analysis will contribute to incorporating diverse user perspectives into design policies and practices and for their further development and implementation. The results, e.g. the impact evaluation methodology, should be applicable and give clear guidance particularly to SMEs and public administrations;
Development of new approaches and solutions which translate into new products, services and processes increasing public sector effectiveness and private sector competitiveness, and sustaining innovation capabilities and processes;
Producing assessment and simulation tools to verify results in the increase of efficiency and/or effectiveness through the use of design;
Mainstreaming design, making it an integral part of value creation and a self-sustaining element of innovation processes;

Recent conclusions of the Council of the European Union recognised cultural heritage as a ""resource for a sustainable Europe"" and highlighted that ""participatory governance of cultural heritage offers opportunities to foster democratic participation, sustainability and social cohesion and to face the social, political and demographic challenges"" in Europe.[1] The European Commission has also highlighted that the contribution of cultural heritage to economic growth and social cohesion is undervalued in spite of growing scientific evidence, and called for an integrated approach to cultural heritage for Europe.[2] It is recognised that cultural heritage is a shared resource for everyone and set the objective of continuing to develop more participative interpretation and governance models that are better suited to the contemporary European context, through greater involvement of the private sector and civil society. Europe's dense network of cultural institutions needs to adapt to changing societal, demographic and economic circumstances. Greater understanding is needed on how the different approaches to participatory governance work in this diverse sector including governance models, consideration of and access to different types of heritage, intergenerational equity etc. It is thus of paramount importance for urban and rural development, tourism, education, creative industries and cultural heritage professionals to understand how to integrate European tangible and intangible cultural heritage into sustainable development, hence the crucial role of social and inclusive innovation. This will also help to promote innovative ways in which to manage increasing flows of EU and non-EU tourists, which are currently largely limited to a number of urban destinations only (""theme park Europe"").
Scope:
a) Research and Innovation Actions
Research under this topic will critically assess the current state of cultural institutions and investigate new ways to develop the role of European culture ministries, cultural institutions and their networks as cultural service providers and hubs of social innovation. It should take into account recent international, European and national research results and best practices. It should have wide European geographic coverage and stakeholder involvement from citizens and cultural institutions that enables innovative research, case studies, pilot actions and smooth uptake of research results. The research should investigate innovative ways in which cultural institutions can engage with younger and more mature audiences, with minority, migrant or socially disadvantaged groups and include them in their governance - and how local communities organise themselves in order to co-create a better use of the local heritage. It should look into the challenges faced by cultural institutions with regard to the necessity to balance needs for managing material collections and opening culture and cultural heritage to new audiences. Research should also investigate the issue of how to combine traditional cultural services with innovative new cultural or social services like adult or lifelong learning, career support, access to and assistance to digital services and e-administrations flexible work arrangement. The gender dimension of these issues should be also considered. The role and potential of enhanced European and international cooperation and networking of culture ministries, cultural departments of local governments and cultural institutions (from traveling artefacts and exhibits to joint curatorial work and other types of sharing resources, expertise and best practices) should also be addressed. The proposed research will draw on comparative perspectives.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU in the order of EUR 2.5 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. This does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
b) Coordination and Support Action[3]
A social platform will bring together relevant heritage stakeholders’ representatives from research communities, heritage practitioners from public or private cultural institutions (heritage sites, libraries, archives, museums, and other public or private collections) and organisations (NGOs, associations), as well as policy-makers at European, national, regional or local levels. For improving the excellence of European heritage management and related policy making the platform should also harness the potential of networking among the growing number of European cultural heritage and cultural studies departments at higher education and research institutions.
Based on a focussed, critical mapping of existing research and practice, the objective of the social platform is to develop an understanding of the challenges and opportunities for research and innovation in the participatory preservation, (re)use and management of cultural heritage. The platform should pay particular attention to the sustainability and employment dimensions of new approaches to cultural heritage, taking into account the issues of data collection and measurement. The platform will map and share European and extra-European best practices, identify emerging new European heritage communities, evaluate bottlenecks and opportunities in the financial and legal environment and create new European networks around the participative preservation, (re)use and management of cultural heritage.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU in the order of EUR 1.5 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. This does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
The actions will form the basis for new institutional strategies to engage new audiences and communities and to combine culture, informal culture and cultural heritage demonstration and preservation with innovative ways of cultural transmission and creative re-use. The findings will help culture ministries, cultural institutions and other relevant actors to reinvent and modernise their policies and their roles as centres of culture, cultural heritage, information, learning and gathering. Results will give guidance on how to promote European culture and further democratise access to it in a way that enables mutual and intercultural understanding. In addition to new academic results, the activities will also provide analytical tools or toolkits, description of best practices and policy recommendations that can facilitate the direct uptake of research and other insights by stakeholders.

","13 September 2017","Specific Challenge:
Cultural diversity is one of Europe's most valuable assets and European educational and cultural systems need to cater for diversity and enable all citizens to build the skills and competences needed for effective inter-cultural dialogue and mutual understanding. The challenge is about understanding how young people make sense of Europe and its differing cultures. The influences on young people are wide ranging including formal education, family and cultural background and media. The aim is to gain a greater understanding of cultural literacy itself as a non-normative concept covering relevant culture-related knowledge, skills and competences and how young people in particular acquire it.
Scope:
The research to address this challenge should focus on one or two dimensions that have to be comprehensively addressed. The research may also cover other issues relevant for addressing the specific challenge.
1) Promoting cultural literacy through formal education
Research under this topic should address concepts of cultural literacy by performing a comparative analysis of cultural literacy of young Europeans of diverse origins and backgrounds as well as their inter-cultural competencies. It should address the role of formal education regarding knowledge, skills and competences needed for effective inter-cultural dialogue and mutual understanding as well as for becoming informed and responsible users and producers of the European cultural heritage and culture. It should study whether ""European culture"" as a possible common set of cultural and conceptual models is emerging for young generations. It should pay particular attention to early childhood (pre-primary), primary and secondary education, due to their importance in building cognitive, emotional and civic bases and study also how cultural literacy developed in formal education influences actual attitudes and behaviours of young people.
2) The role of non-formal and informal education and others factors in the development of cultural literacy
Based on a comparative analysis of cultural literacy of young Europeans of diverse origins and backgrounds as well as of their ""inter-cultural"" competencies, research should investigate the role and impact of informal education in the broadest sense, by family, gender, communities of origin, peer-groups or society at large on the development of cultural literacy. Representations of culture and the role of the Internet, social and digital media in the development of cultural knowledge and skills should equally be investigated, as many ideas related to issues of cultural diversity, popular culture, ethnic groups, minorities, discrimination and segregation are conveyed by such media. Research should identify successful actions that have already proven to have improved cultural literacy and awareness in order to provide recommendations on best practices and make suggestions on how informal forms of education can contribute to enhancing the level of cultural literacy among the young.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU in the order of EUR 5 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. This does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
Research under this topic will contribute to better understanding and enhancing cultural literacy for the young generations, which will lead to greater appreciation of diversity. It will moreover contribute to reinforcing demand for sustainable and creative uses of European cultural heritage. The research will involve policy-makers, stakeholders and educational practitioners for the development and uptake of teaching material and tools both for formal and informal education. This will also include testing innovative practices for enhancing cultural and inter-cultural competencies in their real-life context making reference also to the fight against stereotypes.

","Research and Innovation action
","04 October 2016
","13 September 2017","Specific Challenge:
Religious beliefs and affiliation to religious groups and communities were historically the cornerstones of the functioning of societal relations in Europe. Acknowledging the rich tradition of the co-existence of diverse religions in Europe, the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union enshrines the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion. Despite this strong commitment to the freedom of religion in Europe, religious tensions still exist in many European societies, and have sometimes been exacerbated by the instrumentalisation of religion for political ends by extremists. It is therefore indispensable to understand better the new landscape of religions, secularism and spirituality in Europe and analyse both the roots of radicalisation and religious intolerance and peaceful coexistence and dialogue in Europe in order to support the values and practices of peaceful co-existence and rationality. Contextualising religious co-existence from a historical perspective can contribute to the promotion of a European public and cultural space and to enhancing mutual dialogue and understanding.
Scope:
Using a broad historical and geographical perspective, the proposed comparative and multidisciplinary research will examine various types and elements of co-existence of diverse religious and non-religious communities in Europe today and in the future. It should deepen knowledge about the relations, cooperation, tensions within and among these diverse communities or social groups. The gender dimension of these issues should be also considered. This research will further survey the position and role of religiosity, non-religiosity or other philosophical convictions in today’s European society as well as their role for today’s, especially young, Europeans. It will assess the development of various forms of spirituality as a potential combination/compromise between secularism and religion in modern and post-modern democracies. It will broaden the European comparative perspective of the historical roots of today's religious tolerance and intolerance by also taking into account the historical and present experiences of those countries and territories that joined the EU after the fall of the Iron Curtain.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU in the order of EUR 2.5 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. This does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
By providing a historical and comparative perspective, research will enable European citizens to better grasp the conditions needed for religious and non-religious coexistence in Europe. It will be translated into innovative dissemination tools in order to be used for education purposes of any type (e.g. formal, informal) and discipline (history, political science, civic education) and in proposals for appropriate changes in national educational systems. The conclusions will also inform policy recommendations targeted at policy- and opinion-makers of different levels in preparing future strategies of cooperation with religious communities as well as in coping with anti-religious animosity. Research outcomes will also reach out to the broadest range of media.

The number of space-related Business Incubation Centres (BICs) supporting space-related businesses is growing in Europe, led by national and ESA technology transfer initiatives. There is a need to continue to inspire entrepreneurs to turn space-related business ideas into commercial endeavours and to promote opportunities for new and existing start-ups coming from space and non-space sectors.
Scope:
BICs, as part of their standard offer, routinely offer commercial/high-growth business support to high-tech start-ups. BICs supporting space-related companies should be supported in order to give entrepreneurs comprehensive space-specific commercial and technical assistance to help them start-up businesses that apply space technology to non-space industrial, scientific and commercial fields, and vice-versa. This activity will not support the establishment of additional BICs, but should assist entrepreneurs and other innovation agents overcoming financial, administrative and networking barriers to innovation. In particular, it should contribute to access public funding opportunities, such as the SME instrument of the European Union, as well as potentially other funding opportunities from Member States, ESA and regional authorities. The take up of applications developed in the context of Galileo, EGNOS and Copernicus is encouraged. This action should be complementary to the ESA BICs (that already offer space-specific support) and the European Enterprise Network (EEN) approach, and should encompass other incubation centres that support space-related companies, particularly those exploiting the applications of space data and services.
The Commission considers that one proposal requesting a contribution from the EU in the range of EUR 2.0 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.

","04 October 2016
","13 September 2017","Specific Challenge:
Discourses on the legitimacy of the EU, and especially its democratic deficit, have been a perennial issue for many years but have become significantly more urgent and pressing in times of crisis and austerity. At both ends of the political spectrum, claims about the illegitimacy of current EU governance and regulation have found broader resonance, expressed both in public manifestations of discontent combined with claims for alternative forms of legitimacy and in electoral successes of radical right and radical left parties across Europe. In this context, questions of justice, fairness and European solidarity have equally been raised. The concept of justice is inherently connected with the rule of law and entails a right to justification. Fundamental rights are also key in this regard. The European Stability Mechanism and the Fiscal Compact have been regarded by some as emblematic challenges not only to the rule of law but also to democratic governance. What is more, especially in the light of some recent election results in EU Member States, it seems as if not only the legitimacy of certain policies and institutions have been questioned, but also fundamental issues concerning the locus and exercise of popular sovereignty have been placed on the agenda. The specific challenge is to take the cues from such developments and ensuing contestations over sovereignty and legitimacy in order to reappraise discourses about democratic legitimacy on the one hand, and the rule of law and justice as increasingly thorny issues for the European public space on the other.
Scope:
The research to address this challenge should focus on one or two dimensions that have to be comprehensively addressed taking into account the global context. The research may also cover other issues relevant for addressing the specific challenge.
1) Sovereignty and democracy
In light of the increasing number and growing popularity of alternative discourses about EU legitimacy and the locus of sovereignty, research should re-examine what is meant by sovereignty considering its wider context. Common democratic deficit arguments, in particular in relation to a possible decline of democratic control and participation in Europe, should be examined. This requires inter alia a historical comparative investigation of the sovereign and democratic powers of Member State parliaments and governments, not least in the light of a possible de-legalisation of the (Economic and) Monetary Union. It is of specific importance to clarify questions related to sovereignty and the ultimate source of authority in contemporary EU governance: who does, can and should possess this authority and how is it legitimately exercised at EU level. Research will also assess comparatively new patterns concerning the usage, transformations and popular understandings of various arguments about European legitimacy and sovereignty in public political discourse and in civil society and the conditions under which they do or not resonate among European citizens. It should also revisit the inter-institutional relations in the EU with specific attention to the position of the European Parliament through a thorough analysis of its practices in the legislative process and its functioning. In particular research must normatively assess the constitutional implications of the European Stability Mechanism and the Fiscal Compact for Parliament on the one hand, and the assertion of the Parliament to install the winning party's candidate as Commission President after the 2014 European Parliament elections on the other. Contributions from disciplines beyond law and political science are particularly welcome.
2) Legitimacy through the rule of law, delivery of justice and fundamental rights
Research should reappraise the significance of the rule of law and discourses on justice with regard to the legitimacy of the EU in times of crisis. Of particular importance in this regard is the jurisprudence of both the European Court of Justice and Member States' courts in upholding the rule of law. Research should ascertain whether and to what extent calls for simplification and better laws have any impact on the regulatory activities of EU legislators and the European agencies. The increased importance of the Charter of Fundamental Rights in the wake of the Lisbon Treaty and the nomination of a First Vice President of the Commission with responsibility for Fundamental Rights ought to be considered. The role of mutual recognition, also in relation to the recognition and judgements of other Member States, needs to be explored in this regard. The evolution as well as the strengths and weaknesses of judicial cooperation among Member States should also be examined, whereby it should be considered whether existing justice and home affaires agencies need to be strengthened, and if so how, and/or whether new tools ought to be instituted. Research should critically assess whether and how there is any risk of undermining the rule of law and/or of justificatory discourses by recent and contemporary fiscal governance.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU in the order of EUR 5 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. This does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
Research will inspire and inform future debates on the locus and exercise of sovereignty at EU level and the democratic credentials and deficits of the EU in particular with regard to the new fiscal governance instruments outside the Treaties. Research is also envisaged to feed into future debates on the constitutional arrangements of the EU taking due account electoral developments which appear to pose challenges to those arrangements. Research will deepen the understanding of the significance of the rule of law in general and justification discourses in particular, both at national and supranational level and inform whether and how they can contribute to fostering legitimacy of the EU and to creating a new narrative for Europe.

","04 October 2016
","13 September 2017","Specific Challenge:
The European integration project was conceived as an antidote to a troubled past, especially during the first half of the 20th century. In fact, its very raison d'être was to overcome this burdensome heritage and to avoid once and for all future wars and authoritarian regimes. This was true not only in relation to and in the aftermath of WWII and the Holocaust, but also with regard to the Southern and Eastern enlargement rounds, which were inter alia motivated by embracing European countries that had left behind the yoke of authoritarian and/or totalitarianism - right wing and communist regimes respectively.
In times of crisis, this original telos of European integration is often lost from sight, even though it seems particularly opportune to bring it back into focus when reconsidering the fundamentals of integration in order to overcome the crisis. This integration is not limited to the expansion of the union, migration and global conflicts mean the narrative of troubled pasts in the context of Europe is continually evolving. At both a national and European level we have to look at how we accommodate co-existing narratives on the past. Historical discourses can contribute to cultural dialogue, mutual understanding and enhanced inter-comprehension between European states, nations, communities, minority and migrant groups and individuals. However, they might also be used to deepen perceived divisions and legitimate radicalisation or exclusion. Commemorating and teaching the past as well as preserving and cultivating the memory of troubled pasts are important in this regard. A critical engagement with negative heritage may also facilitate the construction of more value-oriented identities. More knowledge is needed on whether and how such discourses occur in various European countries. The specific challenge is to explore how uncomfortable histories are reflected and reappraised especially with a view to enhancing mutual understanding (and reconciliation when relevant) among Europeans.
Scope:
Research should comparatively explore evidence and narratives of critical reflection and engagement with troubled pasts across Europe. Research will examine phenomena such as commemorations, apology, reconciliation and reparations and will identify major gaps or divergences in historical discourses and representations which might make it difficult to understand and overcome past conflicts or troubled historical legacies. The research to address this challenge should in particular focus on the following key dimensions. It is expected to either comprehensively address one of these dimensions or to combine them. The research may also cover other issues relevant for addressing the specific challenge.
1) Formal education, curricula and teaching practice
Research will survey and compare school curricula in a good range of relevant states with a view to identifying patterns and trends in presenting and interpreting difficult periods of history in a European perspective. It will also analyse whether, and at which stages of formal education, how, and with which intensity, openness and criticism troubled and uncomfortable historical heritage resulting from inter alia wars, conflicts, oppressions, genocides and dictatorships are covered in curricula by educational institutions at the levels of primary and secondary education and in cultural institutions providing services to education. The comparative approach could contribute to exploring differences between historical imageries of neighbouring countries, state majorities and minorities or communities considered as autochthonic or immigrant. Research will not focus solely on history teaching, as historical interpretations might be conveyed by many other disciplines from geography (e.g. implanting symbolic historical geographies) to sciences through arts and especially literature. Research should pay particular attention to primary and secondary education, because of their overwhelming importance in transmitting historical interpretations, bearing in mind that vulnerable or disadvantaged groups may be less represented in higher levels of formal education. Apart from the curriculum, research should also assess the actual practice of teaching such topics, and determine whether there is any discrepancy between the curriculum and its implementation with regard to covering troubled heritage. Crucially, research should develop criteria and indicators to measure how discursive, reflective and critical teaching is and assess teaching practices according to these criteria. Furthermore, it should be explored how these educational efforts, to the extent they exist, influence and impact upon national self-understanding and identity as well on perceptions of European integration.
2) Civil society, informal education and political discourses
Research under this strand should investigate how troubled periods of history are related to informal forms of education. Of particular importance is to survey and investigate comparatively how discourses in civil society and the media, including social and digital media, are informed by such legacies, and how in turn civil society and the media conduct such discourses. Research needs to unearth how national narratives are influenced by difficult pasts and how civil society, politics and the media constructed discourses, and which factors and acts such as commemorations, apology, reconciliations, reparations but also non-action informed both the construction and the evolution of such narratives. The gender dimension of these discourses and their transmission should be also considered. Interconnections between and disparities of national and European historical narratives and symbolical geographies equally ought to be studied. Of interest are also discourses in the profession of historians in the post-war/post-authoritarian period and how they might have evolved over time. Also artistic appropriations of memory in relation to troubled pasts and their receptions by the media and wider public should be explored. In addition to this, research should investigate whether and how such discourses and narratives have impacted upon Member States governments' and citizens' attitudes to European integration and EU membership, both before and after accession to the EU.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU in the order of EUR 2.5 million for each dimension would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. This does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
A deeper knowledge base - on the significance of memory, interpretations and teaching (or silencing) periods of troubled pasts for the construction of historical narratives in contemporary Europe - will inspire and inform specific initiatives. These include appropriate changes in national educational curricula – and innovative educational material on how to critically and constructively reflect and act upon troubled historical heritage and facilitate the development of more nuanced and reflective approaches to interwoven local, regional, national and European histories. Research will also deepen the knowledge base on the significance and impacts of commemoration and cultural representation as well as public discourses on these for civil societies. This will help European policy makers and citizens to re-connect if and where necessary with the raison d'être of European integration.

Culture is the most cherished and valued shared European asset of EU citizens according to surveys. Europe has been associated with and represented by iconic artistic and literary works since Antiquity. From the ancient Greek myth of Europa to Tolstoy's depiction of Napoleonic Europe in ""War and Peace"" and to Beethoven's 9th Symphony passing by medieval sacred arts or iconic European films, the list of artistic and literary expressions that represent Europe for many Europeans or non-Europeans is open-ended. Even without an official consensus about a repertory of these artistic and literary representations of Europe, they form the backbone of a European cultural identity and cultural heritage for many Europeans and for visitors coming to Europe for admiring its unique cultural heritage. However, the creation of cultural heritage is a never ending process. Today's culture is tomorrow's cultural heritage in the making. In this perspective, the specific challenge of the topic is to critically investigate - with the help of social sciences and humanities - the evolving representations of Europe in contemporary artistic and creative expressions in the light of changing societal, historical and cultural contexts.
Scope:
Research under this topic will examine various contemporary artistic and creative practices such as literature, cinema, music and dance, in order to identify and assess their representations of Europe, European identity and Europeanisation. It should have a comparative approach and a wide European geographic coverage. Research should clearly distinguish between positive and negative depictions of Europe and the European Union, and investigate the reasons for such representations. The definition and selection of the artistic, literary and creative manifestations representing Europe should cover various European regions, including post-2004 EU Member States, and potentially from neighbouring countries. Research should consider the role of curation, language, translation and digitalisation in terms of accessing these representations. It should consider implications for perspectives on European culture and cultural heritage and the possibilities to channel research results into formal and informal education in Europe through innovative learning material adapted to contemporary media and art consumption patterns. The early involvement of networks of cultural and/or education institutions should contribute to the efficient uptake of research results.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU in the order of EUR 2.5 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. This does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
Research will result in better knowledge of cultural Europeanisation in the making and in new, innovative tools and material for formal and informal education. The results and their dissemination will contribute to the renewal of cultural narratives of Europe that speak to Europeans of different languages, cultures, religions and origins beyond national borders. It will contribute to enhanced cultural inter-comprehension among Europeans. Research outputs and dissemination means will be adapted to contemporary art and literature consumption patterns in Europe.

Specific challenge:
There is a need to better understand how society as a whole might be affected by risks of accidents, natural disaster or terrorist attack on sensitive sites/areas (involving potentially hazardous substances), in order to enable effective protection measures to be developed. In this respect, the breadth of impacts from Seveso type sites/areas has to be investigated, considering multi-sectoral (inter-)dependencies (notably transport, energy, communications, water). This implies developing knowledge on multiple types of sectors and socio-economic conditions around Seveso type sites/areas that might be affected by accidents, taking into account the type of sites/areas, CBRNE substances of concern, the vulnerability of various sectors and their dependencies/interactions and of the population, risk evaluation based on advanced decision making techniques and scenarios mimicking different levels of severity of impacts.
Scope:
Research should include analysis of risks and strength/vulnerabilities, identification of alternatives resources and focus on the development and testing of qualitative methods that involve identifying links between sectors (multi-sectoral dependencies: systems and connection nodes definition and modeling) and evaluating how impacts from a Seveso typeaccident might affect them (cascades effects). Quantitative impact assessment tools should also be developed to evaluate socio-economic impacts of such accident. Small-scale demonstration activities focusing on SMEs should be considered.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between €3m and €5m would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately (similar to the Seventh Framework Programme Capability Projects described in the general introduction). Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected impact:
- better preparedness to Seveso type site/area related accidents via improved protection measures (including people training and education);
- more effective assessment and decision-making related to the potential severity of a CBRNE accident, in particular regarding ways to decrease the cost of this kind of crisis and develop adequate protection measures in the light of established policy goals:
- better risk assessment to evaluate different sectors, regions or populations for comparing them in terms of relative vulnerability to help set priorities that can guide the allocation of protecting measures financing appropriately;
- enhanced understanding by policy-makers and other stakeholders on how multiple sectors, community, region or nation could be affected in total by an accident from a Seveso site/area, and what the total impact might be (material, human, economic).
The action is expected to proactively target the needs and requirements of public bodies and industry.

Specific challenge:
Culture is the characteristics of a particular group of people, defined by everything from a set of values, history, literature, language, religion to cuisine, social habits or music and arts. Preparedness, response to disasters and after-crisis recovery is always influenced by cultural background of individuals and the society they live in. 
To this end, cultural factors play also an important role in determining the way people respond to stress, engage in the crisis management and accept disaster relief in an emergency situation. At the same time lack of cultural understanding, sensitivity and competencies can hamper and even harm the professional response to disaster as it is crucial to understand the cultural background of disaster victims.
 Scope:
Proposals in this field may focus on the following issues:
Which cultural factors, important insights, specific communication styles for a given cultural group should be taken into consideration during disaster situations in urban areas?
How to anticipate and identify solutions to cultural problems that may arise in the event of an emergency?
Proposers are encouraged to analyse how emotional, psychological and social needs, as well as communal strengths and coping skills that arise in disasters can affect the way certain urban communities prepare, respond, engage in restauration and recover from disaster. The gender dimension needs to be fully taken into account.
The proposal should aim at providing an analysis of existing links between disaster and culture, in particular in urban areas taking into account past and on-going EU research.
 Expected impact:

Specific Challenge:
Critical Infrastructures are crucial assets for the functioning of a society and an economy. Consequently, they can be the target of several threats, in particular terrorist threats.
In this framework, the risk of an insider threat coming from personnel and third party individuals, who have inside knowledge about the infrastructure security practices and/or have access rights to certain key components, data and computer, is particularly high for Critical Infrastructures.
An insider threat particularly difficult to be timely identified is the one brought along by personnel who have undergone a violent radicalisation process and, as a consequence of that, intend to affect the normal functioning of the infrastructure or, even, to sabotage it.
In order to prevent the latter, it is important to deepen the current knowledge about the main constituents of the violent radicalisation processes to timely detect them and to prevent resulting insider threats to materialize.
Scope:
Proposals in this area should specifically aim at strengthening the focus on determining and analysing the main constituent factors of a violent radicalisation process (including family and social environment, psychological factors, religion and ideology, the internet and social media, socio-economic and political factors) as well as on the conditions that can lead a person from ideas to violent action. The proposed actions should take into consideration past and on-going EU research in this field and include, to the extent possible, real life examples of individuals that underwent a violent radicalisation process.
The feasibility of the development and of the application of new equipment and systems to support the security practitioners should also be considered by the proposal.
The proposal and the usable results should take into account fundamental rights protection, comparative studies of international laws, ethical and societal impacts, with particular consideration for EU anti-terrorism and Critical Infrastructure Protection (CIP) policies.
Proposals addressing this topic may involve the use of classified background information (EU or national) or the production of security sensitive results. As such, certain project deliverables may require security classification. The final decision on the classification of projects is subject to the security evaluation.
Expected impact:
The output of this proposal should be directly applicable to support national and local security practitioners to strengthen the protection of national and European Critical Infrastructures from the insider threats brought by violent radicals.
In particular, the results of the proposed action are expected to contribute to an early detection of violent radicals by shedding light on the violent radicalisation processes and paths and, overall, by raising the awareness of the security practitioners about the possible early indicators that can allow a timely detection of insider threats brought to critical infrastructures by violent radicalised individuals.
The action is expected to proactively target the needs and requirements of users, such as national and local law enforcement agencies.

Specific challenge:
The manner in which emergency calls are being made today is changing and the change of pace has legal ramifications for our citizens. Society is using internet-based tools for every day activities but, for instance, making an emergency call using Voice over IP is not possible. Smartphone penetration is growing rapidly and whilst society benefits from this digital world, the future of how we make emergency calls is not so clear. In this context, there is a need to identify the main requirements of emergency services (the demand side) on the basis of existing research information and to identify research gaps. There is also a need to improve the security of citizens, including those with disabilities or special needs, by creating the environment and infrastructure to allow technology and solution providers (the supply side), in particular SMEs, to test their Internet Protocol-based 112 emergency communication end-to-end against such requirements with each other and with the emergency services.
Scope:
The proposal should contribute to the development of a testing regime for Next Generation 112 products (simultaneous use of voice, data, video and text communications using 112 over the internet) in a controlled-environment. It should also build a validation-focused programme/framework  using existing standards and protocols, with consideration of e.g. call location and routing, video calling to assist people with disabilities, security, integration of social media channels Next Generation eCall, messaging and early warning systemsetc. The proposal should gather European technology providers, emergency services organisations, research and development laboratories, telecommunication network providers, Voice Over IP providers, and software providers to build on the expertise in a collaborative fashion.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between €2m and €5m would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately (similar to the Seventh Framework Programme Capability Projects described in the general introduction). Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected impact:
A greater efficiency from emergency service organisations will have obvious societal benefits for all citizens, with a direct positive impact for those citizens with disabilities. This proposal shall contribute to the implementation of a common standard of emergency call services throughout Europe, ensuring, that the future media for daily communication can also be used for emergency calling. It shall facilitate the interoperability of the many involved technologies and services and their vendors and providers.
The action is expected to proactively target the needs and requirements of public bodies and law enforcement.
The outcome of the proposal is expected to lead to development up to Technology Readiness Levels (TRL) 7; please see part G of the General Annexes.

Over the past decade, we have seen that cyber attacks have become increasingly sophisticated, stealthy, targeted and multi-faceted which may leverage zero-day exploits and highly creative interdisciplinary attack methods.
Detecting and responding to such attacks by a highly motivated, skilled and well-funded attacker has however been proven highly challenging.
As our society is becoming increasingly dependent on (critical) cyber infrastructure, new technologies are needed to increase our detection and response capabilities.
Scope:
Research and Innovation Actions –Situational Awareness
The focus of the proposals should be on the development of novel approaches for providing organisations the appropriate situational awareness in relation to cyber security threats allowing them to detect and quickly and effectively respond to sophisticated cyber-attacks.
The solution may leverage techniques such as anomaly detection, visualisation tools, big data analysis, threat analysis, deep-packet inspection, protocol analysis, etc as well as interdisciplinary research to counter threat actors and their methods.
The proposals should also consider the need to collect necessary forensic information from attackers that can be used as evidence in court.
Proposals should assess and address the impact to fundamental rights, data protection and privacy in particular, in the design and development of their solutions.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU between EUR 2 and 3 million would allow these areas to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
The outcome of the proposals is expected to lead to development up to Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 3 to 5; please see part G of the General Annexes.
Innovation Actions – Simulation Environments, Training
Proposals should develop innovative simulation environments and training materials in order to adequately prepare those tasked with defending high-risk organisations to counter advanced cyber-attacks.
The simulation environments should take into consideration the following challenges:
Tools for creating realistic cyber environments that fit the training objectives and tools for producing both benign and malicious system events that fit the training scenario;
Real-time student performance assessment, dynamic configuration and adaptation of exercise scope and difficulty;
Exercise monitoring and evaluation of its state, being able to control the progress of the exercise, detect inconsistencies and hard-to-solve situations, etc;
Definition and creation of new scenarios and cyber threats in a cost and time-effective manner, and that better achieve the pedagogical objectives for a wide variety of student profiles;
In the context of cyber security attacks, proposals may also consider scenario building and simulation training to prepare organisations' response and decision making processes in relation obligations stemming from applicable legal frameworks or in the wider context of managing crises and emergency situations.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU between EUR 4 and 5 million would allow these areas to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.

The use of modern telecommunications and on-line services involve users' personal information.. For example, using search engines exposes the query terms used, which can be both sensitive and identifying, as illustrated by the exposure of search terms; social networking services expect users to reveal their social connections, messages and preferences, that could lead to direct privacy violation if exposed. Browsing the web also leaves traces of where users have gone, their interests, and their actions - meta-data that can be used to profile individuals.
The implementation the draft General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR - currently in the law-making process) presents both technological as well as organisational challenges for organisations which have to implement novelties such as the right to data portability, the right to be forgotten, data protection impact assessments and the various implementations of the principle of accountability.
Many services on the Internet depend on the availability of secure digital identities which play a crucial role in safeguarding the data and privacy of citizens as well as protecting them and other actors such as private companies or public services form various online threats. At the same time, many European countries already have or are in the process of developing an electronic identity (eID) scheme. Most of these projects are built to be at a very high security level, which makes them very suitable for diverse eGovernment processes. But in turn they may lack usability for commercial applications.
Scope:
Innovation Actions: Proposals may cover one of the strands identified below.
Privacy-enhancing Technologies (PET)
Novel designs and tools to provide users with the functionality they require without exposing any more information than necessary, and without losing control over their data, to any third parties. PET should be available in a broad spectrum of products and services, with usable, friendly and accessible safeguards options. PET should be developed having also cost effective solutions.
Comprehensive and consistent Privacy Risks Management Framework should be available, in order to allow people to understand their privacy exposure (i.e. helping people to understand what happens to their data when they go online, use social networks etc).
Open source and externally auditable solutions are encouraged in order to maximise uptake and increase the trustworthiness of proposed solutions.
General Data Protection Regulation in practice
Tools and methods to assist organisations to implement the GDPR taking into account the final provisions of GDPR and guidance from relevant authorities (Data Protection Authorities, Art 29 WP or its successor).
Proposals may also address the need to provide support (procedures, tools) for entities to understand how to operate without requiring unnecessary information (so as to promote privacy respecting practices), in particular when the issue is mainly related to the fact that organizations (businesses, service providers, and government agencies) often require too much information from their target customer/user.
Secure digital identities
With a view to reducing identity fraud while protecting the privacy of citizens, proposals should develop innovative, secure and privacy enhancing digital identity platforms beyond national eID systems.
Activities may leverage existing European electronic identification and authentication platforms with clearly defined interfaces based on the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).
Proposals may:
Leverage evidence-based identities (using adequate correlation of multiple soft proofs of identity, as opposed to the usage of a central register);
Provide a function for so called “qualified anonymity”, which means, that the online service does not have any information about the user but a pseudonym. The real identity of the user can only be revealed under specific conditions such as at the request of legal authorities;
Consider cost-effective and user-friendly verification methods for mobile identity documents.
For all strands, proposals should identify and address the societal and ethical dimensions of the strand they choose to cover taking into consideration the possibly divergent perspectives of pertinent stakeholders.
Proposals have to address the specific needs of the end-user, private and public security end users alike. Proposals are encouraged to include public security end-users and/or private end users.

Specific challenge:
New digital technologies are all around us but their impact on society is often difficult to assess, let alone predict. The rapid development and expansion of the digital ecosystem confronts society with numerous challenges to ensure trust and confidence of citizens in and the legitimacy of highly complex, dynamic and hyper-connected systems.
As recognized in the EU Cybersecurity Strategy the same norms, principles and values that the EU upholds offline, should also apply online. The challenge is to define what is needed to ensure a flourishing information society which offers safety and security and at the same time respects Europe's fundamental values and rights.
It is therefore essential to ensure that new and innovative cybersecuirty technologies are designed to incorporate European values and fundamental rights, which include autonomy, equality, privacy, combined with fairness and accountability and ensure the 'right' level of control individuals can exercise over their actions and the technology they utilize. Often, these values might be in competition with one another.
In this context, it is also crucial to understand the role of the public and the private sector concerning the acceptance and acceptability of digital technologies in a networked environment in order to allow citizens to make informed and responsible choices regarding innovative products and services leading to a strong European market for innovative and effective cybersecurity technology.
Proposals are encouraged to engage with public security end-users and/or private end users.
Scope:
The coordination and support activity should facilitate community building and deepen understanding involving relevant stakeholders from civil society, research, industry and public bodies in order to develop a comprehensive knowledge for the EU of the challenges and opportunities for value-sensitive ICT innovation in a trustworthy digital society.
In particular, work in this topic should focus on:
Developing ways to determine the relation between the perceived risks and benefits of new technologies in the field of digital security and their associated acceptability and acceptance;
Defining mechanisms to determine how our fundamental values and rights can be taken into account in the development process of new technologies to ensure that they are applied when used in innovative services and products;
Proposing rules and guidance on how these new technologies will safeguard these values and rights;
Identifying existing best practices on cybersecurity norms and rules accommodating European values and rights;
Drafting standards and guidelines for industry and the public sector to enable consumers to exert a high level of control over devices and services as well as to ensure accountability with respect to the acceptable usage of new digital technologies; and
Identifying the key factors for promoting a secure and innovative ecosystem through fostering the creation of secure technologies in line with European values.
Addressing the specific needs of the end-user, private and public security end user alike.
Expected impact:
Better understanding of the mechanisms that lead to the acceptance of risks associated with new digital services in a networked environment and of the ways how acceptability of new services can be maintained;
Providing better understanding of the links between risk perception of societies and cyber security;
Deeper insight into how networked ICT, autonomous system and devices as well as services influence the perception of citizens with respect to security and their values of for instance freedom and autonomy;
New approaches for users to exercise control over their data and maintain the desired autonomy of their actions in the digital domain while instigating innovative business models for value-sensitive ICT products and services;
Recommendations for regulatory measures necessary for a responsible and sustainable development and use of cyber technology; and
Establishment of a broad and durable constituency, which supports the uptake of results and further work beyond the lifetime of the project.

The transfer to industrial companies of the Do It Yourself (DIY), fablabs, micro-factories and makers approaches can pioneer ways towards engineering solutions throughout the whole value chain. These innovative methods can lead to new processes, machines and products with new functionalities and shorter time to market.
Industry is not yet widely using such innovative approaches to engage consumers and respond to societal needs, also taking into account the individual preferences of women and men. Collaborative production liaising companies, especially SMEs, with these new approaches can however create Open Innovation networks that can unroll a wide range of entirely new business opportunities for the benefit of consumers.
Scope:
Proposals should particularly cover consumer-goods sectors and couple design, creativity and knowledge with a customer-driven production. The co-creation of products in both ends of the value chain represents customer involvement in the production. In particular, proposals should cover at least three out of the following areas:
Novel approaches to capitalise on the knowledge and ideas of design and engineering coming from different and even new actors;
Design of new strategies based on creative and agile methodologies for analysis;
Development of knowledge, technologies and tools to share and analyse relevant data and demands from users as well as to fully enable collaborative engineering in the production network, allowing all actors to propose innovative solutions;
Development of open source product data exchange and standard representations of products and processes that ensure the compatibility of modelling and simulation with different process information systems;
Development of new Manufacturing Demonstration Facilities (MDFs), where companies will test new technologies in cooperation with fablabs and makers in order to develop real industrial products and where training is offered.
Proposals also need to take into account Social Science and Humanities (SSH) aspects regarding creativity.
Proposals submitted under this topic should include actions designed to facilitate cooperation with other projects; to enhance user involvement; and to ensure the accessibility and reusability of data produced in the course of the project.
Activities should start at TRL 4 and achieve TRL 6 at the end of the project.

This topic will support the implementation of the Blueprint beyond Additive Manufacturing within several areas from the Factories of the Future priorities.
Scope:
Identify shortages and mismatches in technical and non-technical skills, knowledge and competences in Advanced Manufacturing (including digital capabilities);
Map the most relevant existing national initiatives upskilling the existing workforce in order to develop an EU wide strategy;
Put in place activities related to lifelong learning and granting of qualification for personnel in industrial settings. Develop real case scenarios providing efficient methodologies that can be applied in a variety of industrial areas;
Innovative and hands-on approaches, including Social Sciences and Humanities (SSH) elements, in upskilling of the existing workforce and attracting more women to the field, through training activities (including training of trainers) and knowledge management with direct involvement of senior employees. On-site, modular and e-learning education should be offered free of charge for re-use;
Exchange of information between industry, trade unions, educational centres, national employment agencies at European scale.
Proposals are also encouraged to seek synergies with national initiatives funded under the European Social Fund, projects from the Skills Alliances and, where relevant, other future initiatives launched at European level.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU between EUR 1 and 2 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
Real and measurable steps towards the reduction of identified skill gaps leading to the upskilling of the existing workforce in Europe and, as a consequence, increased innovation performance in the industry concerned;
At least 15 new job profiles per industrial area analysed, leading to a longer work life for jobholders;
Close and continuous engagement between relevant industry, trade union, academia, educational centres (including vocational schools) across Europe to stimulate networks in the European Research Area as a whole.

","31 October 2017
","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Human-Robot Collaboration (HRC) on the factory floor has a high potential economic impact for European industry.
Past research to implement HRC in an industrial setting concentrated largely on safety of humans, allowing workers and robots to share working space without fences. Most of the developments started from existing industrial robotic arms, augmenting it with technologies to make it safe for humans to interact with the robot. This has already led to production environments with safe interaction between humans and robots. However genuine collaboration between humans and robots require more holistic solutions encompassing smart mechatronic systems designed to improve the quality of the job performed and to increase flexible production. Such systems have not yet been demonstrated for manufacturing purposes.
In order to move from a structured factory floor where robots work behind closed fences to an open environment with smart mechatronic systems and humans collaborating closely, interdisciplinary research in the fields of robotics, cognitive sciences and psychology is required, also taking into account regulatory aspects. More attention has to be paid to develop novel inherently-safe robotic concepts where collaboration with humans is taken up already in the design phase. In order for effective HRC to be taken up by industry, beyond safety aspects, including ergonomics, adaptability, liability issues, inclusiveness of vulnerable workers, acceptability and feedback from users need to be considered in a holistic way.
Scope:
Proposals need to extend the current state of the art of individual HRC to work environments where robots and workers function as members of the same team throughout the factory.
Proposals should cover two of the following three areas:
Integration in industrial production environments of novel human-centred designed smart mechatronic systems such as for example soft robotics for high payloads;
Implementation of novel artificial intelligence technologies capable of massive information processing and reacting in real-time to enable new levels of autonomy, navigation, cognitive perception and manipulation for robots to collaborate with humans in the process;
Development of methods for robotic hazard assessment and risk management to clarify trade-offs between productivity and safety for mixed human-robot smart devices environments.
Proposals need also to take into account Social Sciences and Humanities (SSH) elements regarding human-related barriers for the uptake of smart mechatronic systems including robot technology in industrial environments such as ergonomics, user experience, comfort, trust, feeling of safety and liability in modern production facilities, taking into account age and gender aspects.
Proposals submitted under this topic should include actions designed to facilitate cooperation with other projects; to enhance user involvement; and to ensure the accessibility and reusability of data produced in the course of the project.
Activities should start at TRL 4 and achieve TRL 6 at the end of the project.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU between EUR 6 and 8 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
Demonstrating the potential to bring back production to Europe;
15% increase in OECD Job Quality Index through work environment and safety improvement;
20% reduction in production reconfiguration time and cost.
Relevant indicators and metrics, with baseline values, should be clearly stated in the proposal.

","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Governance is being transformed by new approaches to delivering public services which allow for the involvement of citizens and various other actors. The challenge is to critically assess and support as needed this transformation based on an open collaboration and innovation platform supported by ICT ('government as a platform') and on an open environment and ecosystem with clear frameworks and guidelines for modular services quality ('government as a service') in accordance with the EU eGovernment Action Plan 2016-2020 [1] and the European Interoperability Framework Implementation Strategy[2].In addition, how can public-private partnerships, big data and algorithms also reduce 1) the legitimacy of public services, and 2) potential bias in how these services are offered when informed by algorithms and big data.
In particular, to deliver better (and ethical) public services, public administrations need to regroup resources together under common infrastructures at the European level that serve the needs of various actors and enable the participation of all relevant communities including elderly people, people with disabilities and migrants. Mobile apps providing access to public services are likely to become the norm to facilitate the interaction and engagement of citizens with public administrations. In addition, to ensure a cost efficient provision of inclusive digital services, there is a pressing need to identify gaps in accessibility solutions, to identify related good and bad practices, and to promote training, awareness raising and capacity building.
Scope:
In a context of open government and digital democracy, the role of the government is changing due to its use of ICT and to the increasing pervasiveness of ICT across all parts of society. In addition to being a manager of societal assets, government is becoming a provider of tools, opportunities, guidance and incentives for co-creation as well as a guarantor of public values over the longer term.
a) Coordination and Support Action (2018) [3]
For a cost efficient provision of inclusive digital services, the proposed action will:
1. identify gaps in the current accessibility solutions and establish related best practices,
2. promote training, awareness raising, and capacity building.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 1 and 2 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
b) Research and Innovation action (2019)
Proposals should develop and demonstrate the potential for sharing common services with different actors (public and private and third sectors) to achieve efficiency and effectiveness in these collaborations. The proposals should also evaluate the role and responsibility of the public authorities and of the other actors delivering public goods and services in the new governance model and the related partnerships, including in terms of the challenges of ensuring secure access and use. Evidence of the benefits of the full implementation of the once-only and digital-by-default principles and user centricity and the transformative impact of new technologies such as blockchain should also be taken into account.
Proposals should also lead to the development of business plans that would ensure the long-term sustainability of the new governance model. They should engage multi-disciplinary and multi-sectoral teams to explore the complexity of this challenge and to identify the necessary changes as well as the legal, cultural and managerial risks and barriers to its implementation.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 3 and 4 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
For 2019 proposals shall include a minimum of six relevant national administrations (or legal entities designated to act on their behalf) in at least six different EU Member States or Associated Countries. The Commission expects to finance only one proposal under this action in 2019.
c) Research and Innovation action (2020)
Proposals should analyse, develop and demonstrate the potential for sharing common services with different actors (public and private and third sectors) to achieve efficiency and effectiveness in these collaborations, in particular leveraging mobile communications and Apps. The proposals should also evaluate the role, legitimacy and responsibility of the public authorities and of the other actors delivering public goods and services in the new governance model and the related partnerships, including in terms of ensuring secure mobile single sign-on for cross border access and use of services. Evidence of the benefits of the full implementation of the once-only and digital-by-default principles and user centricity and the transformative impact of new technologies should also be taken into account.

The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 3 and 4 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
Solutions for opening up and connecting public administration data and services will have a measurable impact for both businesses and citizens, leading to efficiency gains. The actions will provide for all the elements required to facilitate the migration of public administrations towards forward-looking models, in particular mobile ones, for the co-delivery of public services.
The actions will provide evidence of how the open government approach may reinforce trust in public institutions, which is strongly associated with citizens’ satisfaction from full deployment of inclusive digital government. The actions will also contribute to establishing a culture of co-creation and co-delivery, transparency, accountability and trustworthiness as well as of continuous consultation promoting overall digital accessibility.
In addition, to support the implementation of the Web Accessibility Directive, enhanced cooperation on digital accessibility between various stakeholders will result in scalable and more affordable accessibility solutions. Overall, the actions will contribute to the widespread recognition of the need for and benefits of an inclusive Digital Single Market.

Given the complexity of our societies, public authorities need innovative means and tools that can enable them to develop better evidence-based policies. The development of such policies needs to involve local actors such as citizens and businesses, in order to better inform policy-making while ensuring higher levels of acceptance for policies and of trust in the authorities. Data analytics and usage of cloud infrastructure to gain access to shared data can help improve policy making at all levels, national but also local. Moreover, engaging citizens and local actors in the generation of data or in the analysis of 'big data' and its ethical issues can assist local governance.
Scope:
The availability of open and big data, in particular as facilitated by high-performance computing (HPC) capabilities offered by the European Cloud Initiative [1], would provide an infrastructure with data and analytical power for the public administration.

The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 3 and 4 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
Solutions for opening up and connecting public administration data and services will have a measurable impact for both businesses and citizens, leading to efficiency gains. The actions will provide for all the elements required to facilitate the migration of public administrations towards forward-looking models, in particular mobile ones, for the co-delivery of public services.
The actions will provide evidence of how the open government approach may reinforce trust in public institutions, which is strongly associated with citizens’ satisfaction from full deployment of inclusive digital government. The actions will also contribute to establishing a culture of co-creation and co-delivery, transparency, accountability and trustworthiness as well as of continuous consultation promoting overall digital accessibility.
In addition, to support the implementation of the Web Accessibility Directive, enhanced cooperation on digital accessibility between various stakeholders will result in scalable and more affordable accessibility solutions. Overall, the actions will contribute to the widespread recognition of the need for and benefits of an inclusive Digital Single Market.

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
The consequences of digitisation and of the implementation of the Digital Single Market on cultural diversity, on access to culture and on the creation of cultural value need to be better monitored and understood, also through joint efforts by researchers, practitioners and policy-makers. Beyond the issue of portability of cultural content, coping strategies related to legislation on intellectual property rights (IPR) and copyright at European and national levels are at the heart of current creative practices and business opportunities in the cultural and creative sectors and, as such, deserve in-depth scrutiny. Innovative solutions for measuring the impact of digitisation and of the digital market on culture are also needed. In addition, an important knowledge gap exists when it comes to the adaptive or alternative strategies of different cultural institutions and of various creative and artistic communities.
Scope:
Proposals should assess the impact of digitisation on access to European cultural goods and services. Proposals should also consider whether increasing digitisation of cultural works may have contributed towards the democratisation of cultural creativity and influenced the formation of social identities in the EU, and whether IPR and copyright may have helped or hindered this process. They should provide a comparative cross-national mapping of differences in the governance and implementation of processes for IPR and copyright harmonisation and for the improvement of digital access to culture. With the aim to provide contextualised new evidence, proposals should deploy participatory research approaches targeted to specific creative and cultural sectors, interest groups, and creative and artistic communities and networks. They should also develop innovative solutions to address practices and bottlenecks jeopardising IPR and copyright protection on the one hand and erecting barriers for creative practices or culture-based business or employment opportunities on the other hand. Copyright and IPR protection and pricing policies should be assessed with a view to maximising access and stimulating creativity, creative (re)use and production. Proposals should evaluate the importance of the Digital Single Market for the for-profit, non-profit and mixed cultural and creative activities in Europe.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU in the order of EUR 3 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
By providing qualitative and quantitative analysis and by proposing solutions, business models and policy recommendations, the action will contribute to a better understanding of regulation and fairer accessibility of digitised cultural goods and services. It will also advise on appropriate levels of harmonisation of copyright and IPR, thereby contributing to the development and deepening of the Digital Single Market.

One of Europe’s strengths in manufacturing is its abundance of SME equipment manufacturers with the capability to offer world-class products of highest quality and precision. A further strength is the large number of actors having off-the-shelf prototypes ready for experimentation and for market uptake. To increase their visibility towards global users of equipment and to further support digitisation of manufacturing, industrial online platforms needs to be developed and set up for use on the market.
Scope:
(a) design and build the digital platform that brings together suppliers and users in a transparent and efficient way; and (b) populate it with adequate product information. This will constitute a set of pilot implementations intended to sell ‘plug and produce’ industrial equipment and services to customers globally. The platform should therefore facilitate B2B transactions and host associated services in the form of digital product models allowing users to simulate (e.g. digitally test) the capabilities of the equipment on offer and its compliance to standards. This will ultimately boost product quality, transparency and usability based on Return on Experience The digital platform should enable all of the following:
Transparency of product features, capabilities, resource use, associated add-on services and price;
Customer feedback, real-time use feedback (anonymised as needed) and associated options;
Scalability with respect to technological development and manufacturing application domains;
Information about standards and regulatory compliance (e.g. the facilitation of re- and de-manufacturing) as well as security requirements.
Social Sciences and Humanities (SSH) elements should cover issues such as business model/ownership economics and adequate administration. Work should cover in particular user interface aspects to encourage active customer feedback.
Activities under (b) include the incorporation of suppliers or users of the equipment pilots and/or developers of additional applications and services where appropriate. Beneficiaries may provide support to third parties as described in part K of the General Annexes of the Work Programme. The support to third parties can only be provided in the form of lump sums. The respective options of Article 15.1 and Article 15.3 of the Model Grant Agreement will be applied.
Each consortium will define the selection process of the third parties for which financial support will be granted. The typical amount per party shall be in the order of EUR 50 000 to 100 000, as these parties are responsible for achieving the objective of activities under (b).[1] Around one third of the EU funding requested by the proposal shall be allocated to the purpose of financial support to third parties.[2]
Proposals submitted under this topic should include actions designed to facilitate cooperation with other projects; to enhance user involvement; and to ensure the accessibility and reusability of data produced in the course of the project.
Activities should start at TRL 5 and achieve TRL 7 at the end of the project.
This topic is part of the lump sum funding pilot scheme[3]. Funding for grants awarded under this topic will take the form of a fixed lump sum of EUR 7.5 million.
Expected Impact:
Deliver a B2B online platform covering at least one key industrial equipment domain and mobilising actors across Europe;
Demonstrate the full capability of the platform in one dedicated industrial domain, including associated product services (e.g. digital models enabling functional simulation) and including the services from all third parties selected in line with the conditions set out in Part K of the General Annex;
Showcase the platform’s scalability capability (towards all relevant industrial domains) via a reference architecture;

The World Health Organization estimates that about 80% of premature heart disease cases, strokes, type 2 diabetes and 40% of cancers could be avoided if the major risk factors for non-communicable diseases, such as unhealthy diets, were eliminated[1]. Whereas a one-size-fits-all approach may fail, personalized nutrition can empower consumers to adhere to a long-lasting, healthy, pleasurable, nutritional and sustainable diet when tailored to individual parameters such as: the physical and psychological characteristics (health status, phenotype, genotype, microbiome configuration), the needs and preferences, behaviour, lifestyle, and budget; alongside to general economic factors (e.g. market prices) and socio-cultural aspects. Personalised nutrition can be used for different target groups from healthy people to patients such as malnourished people, vulnerable groups, people with allergies or non-communicable diseases, including cancer. Specific dietary and behavioural advice and/or support should be based on robust scientific evidence and knowledge from nutritional, medical, biological and social sciences and the humanities. Tackling this challenge requires a combined inter- and transdisciplinary approach engaging academics, policy makers, civil society, relevant industry and market actors.
Scope:
Proposals shall deliver innovative solutions for personalized nutrition advice and/or support that will help consumers to achieve their optimal health and well-being and to adopt long-term healthy and sustainable diets. These concepts/tools/products/services shall focus on the consumer benefit and integrate all relevant factors such as health indicators, nutritional requirements, food composition, lifestyle, preferences, environment (i.e. cultural and socio-economic), etc. Moreover, proposals shall address all levels of personalization: from food choice in the shop, to customised production and delivery, to specific advice/warning systems (e.g. new, smart digital/ICT applications). Besides activities such as prototyping, testing, demonstrating, piloting and large-scale products validation in a near to operational environment, proposals may include limited research activities. Assessment and deepening the understanding of the drivers of food choice, the food environment, incentives and other relevant aspects influencing the motivation and behavioural change needed to sustain long term healthy and sustainable diets are essential. Proposals shall also develop and/or validate innovative approaches/methods/technologies for dietary assessment (e.g. measure dietary intake). Proposals shall build on existing knowledge and make use of relevant research infrastructures. To ensure the success of the developed actions, consumer engagement and acceptance, gender differences in patterns of nutrition and ethical issues, particularly on the use of personal data, should be taken into account. When applicable, proposals should address requirements from relevant EU regulatory frameworks, including pre-market approval.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of the order of EUR 7 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
In the framework of SDG no 1, 2, 3, 9, 12 and 15, the EU's Bioeconomy Strategy 2012, and the FOOD 2030 Staff Working Document[2], proposals should explain how activities included contribute to:

The increasing occurrence of disasters such as floods, earthquakes, fires, and pollution can sometimes cause irreversible damage to cultural heritage sites and historical documents, or destroy entire areas together with the documents and monuments therein. Europe's cultural heritage sites and many more historical documents, monuments and historic buildings across the Member States are in danger. Apart from losing our heritage, the culture and creative sectors, and related industries such as tourism and hospitality rely heavily on the appeal and conservation of cultural heritage sites, documents and monuments. Digital technology can help preserve the knowledge of threatened heritage artefacts, museums, monuments, documents and sites and make them accessible for citizens across Europe and for future generations. In addition, online access to high quality holistically documented digital replicas (including storytelling) of artefacts, sites, documents and monuments may increase the appeal and promotion of a place, city or Member State, thus supporting the local tourism and hospitality industries.
Scope:
Proposals under this action should set up a ""Competence Centre"" aiming at the preservation and conservation of European Cultural Heritage using new state-of-the-art ICT technologies. The Competence Centre should map past and ongoing research, collect, analyse and promote best practices from Europe and beyond, and become a major point of European reference for transnational and interdisciplinary networking in the preservation of Cultural Heritage.
The Competence Centre should support cultural institutions to benefit from the opportunities brought by new ICT technologies by sharing best practices on technical, legal, and online publishing requirements, etc. as well as increasing cooperation in the sector, with a special attention to 3D technologies and corresponding standards.
The Competence Centre should also act as a facilitator for access to finance and mapping possibilities as well as an ambassador for massive digitisation of endangered European Cultural Heritage. The Competence Centre should also pave the way for future European research on cultural heritage that would need a holistic research agenda and an inclusive interdisciplinary approach, bringing together multidisciplinary expertise such as historians, archaeologists, architect, geographers, civil engineering, chemical engineering and conservation scientists, craftsmanship, social and human sciences.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of around 3 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. The duration should be around 3 years. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts. The sustainability of this competence centre should be foresee and set in place during the duration of the project.
Expected Impact:
The Competence Centre should increase the quality of preservation initiatives undertaken by Cultural Heritage institutions. It should also demonstrate how it will contribute to an increase in the number of and quality of digitised monuments and documents. This would allow a better use and re-use of new digital assets. The Competence Centre should also strengthen the coordination between all players in the Cultural Heritage domain and upscale the competences of the potential users.

Education, in particular at school level, has to keep the pace with the digital transformation of our society. While some schools have a culture of well-developed ICT strategies and pursue very innovative practices, they often work in isolation and there is a growing digital gap between schools that are advanced and those who are not leveraging the advantages of ICT-based pedagogies. The greatest challenge is to mainstream digital innovation in education that contributes to improve educational performance and school climate, reaching the less advanced schools and teachers. To accelerate the digital transformation of schools in Europe, there is a need for sharing, discussing, spreading and adopting innovative practices, supporting a whole-school approach and promoting a model of school mentoring. This requires implanting and fostering a broader culture of innovation and leveraging networks and hubs of innovation to help disseminate and widely diffuse best practice involving ICT. Accelerating digital transformation in education and delivering high-quality digital education to all students requires bridging this gap and accelerating change by diffusing innovative ICT-based educational practices across schools and stimulating bottom-up diffusion of innovation through school-to-school peer-learning.
Scope:
the action will build, coordinate and seek to expand an inclusive pan-European network of schools where schools (school leaders and teachers) interested in pedagogical uses of ICT can build their know-how by learning from their more advanced peers through demonstrations of best pedagogically sound practice. The action will in particular focus on mainstreaming the innovation process, which leads to positive results, using a policy-connected approach by involving policy-makers at regional and national level. The action will also include bottom-up, regional grassroots actions that support the situated take up of ICT and ICT-based practices between schools with various levels of technological proficiency, particularly within countries where mainstreaming of innovative use of ICT in schools is still at a relatively low level and paying attention to contexts where such patterns of cooperation are not yet prevalent. The action will particularly: 1) collect and document evidence of cases where whole-school peer-learning methodologies have been successfully used in the Member States, and the associated ones, with a view to further scaling-up, and also compare them with less successful cases 2) build on and involve the existing networks, ‘multiplier’ structures and regional hubs to mainstream change; 3) set up collaboration between more advanced and less advanced schools and support the exchange or practice with instructional design, paying attention to their specific educational contexts; 4) leverage an EU-level awareness-raising platform or infrastructure to promote the idea and models of mentoring scheme; actions may propose using existing platforms to save resources for other activities 5) explore which incentives and rewards for advanced schools make it attractive for them to participate as mentors in school clusters to mainstream their innovative practices 6) will support the development of whole-school approaches to ICT deployment and the mainstreaming of innovative practice involving ICT in schools across Europe 7) provide a strategy and a plan how to achieve greatest impact possibly by involving institutional actors such as Ministries of Education and disseminate the model of mentoring among schools.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU in the order of EUR 1 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
The proposals should provide meaningful and ambitious indicators on how the whole requested range of impacts will be measured, including the improvements resulting from the digital innovation actions, as well as the number of countries and schools to be reached.
A significant number of schools connected and supported by the network to exchange best practices and develop a whole-school approach involving all levels of school governance to implementing ICT and a significant number of policy-makers and educational stakeholders provided with actionable guidance on how to successfully mainstream a culture of innovation across European schools

(2018):
Digitisation still focuses mainly on capturing the visual appearance of objects, collections or sites. It is also often centralised and static, with an expert performing digitisation and archiving and with digitised cultural resources rarely updated and consolidated. With heritage being both tangible and intangible, the challenge is to design solutions for generating a comprehensive picture of the studied assets, capturing and re-creating not only visual and structural information, but also stories and experiences together with their cultural, historical and social context and their evolution over time.
(2020):
In cultural heritage institutions, the quantity of digital content is growing exponentially, together with the potential of new digital technology performance. This large amount of data presents an increasing challenge of management to curators. Work in this area should enable heritage institutions scholars and practioners to fully use the potential of digital technologies for managing, studying, conserving, restoring, making accessible, interlinking, disseminating and preserving their collections.
On the other hand, the technological advancement presents opportunities, namely with regard to digitisation. So far, digitisation focused mainly on capturing the visual appearance of individual objects, collections or sites. There is a real need to establish a comprehensive picture of the studied assets, capturing and re-creating not only visual and structural information, but also stories and experiences (stored in language data), together with their cultural and socio-historical context, as well as their evolution over time. In addition, the current approach to digitisation is often localised and static: single experts perform the digitisation and the archiving; the digitised cultural tangible (artefacts, historical sites) and intangible resources (stories, experiences, written memory of the society) are rarely consolidated and interlinked, preventing deeper exploitation of the resources through wider searchability via other domains, networks or languages.
Scope:
a. Innovation Action (2018):
Proposals under this action should address the curation and preservation of digital assets. They should provide new technologies and methods that enable, among others, richer experiences, storytelling and the linking of physically separated objects and sites, and tangible and intangible heritage. It should pay attention to the emergence of more dynamic and personalised digital resources which pose new issues in terms of curation and preservation.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 4 and 5 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
b. Research and Innovation Action (2020):
Departing from the current paradigm of localised and static archiving, the scope is to develop one or more of the following new technologies and methods:
In order to develop the concept of active digital resources, sound and comprehensive documentation management tools are needed that continuously consolidate digital assets. This will be achieved through capturing over time, results stemming from a variety of digitisation methods connected to active sensor networks or to semantic web technologies. This will allow for analysis and semantic evaluation of digital assets and resources of cultural heritage.
Consolidation takes also into account the relevance of historical sources (e.g. monuments and documents) and resources (e.g. studies on how language transmits our cultural memory of events) and that a resource evolves over time through cultural impact, research and curation (e.g. studies on how culture shaped a specific collection or how historical events shaped spaces). The continuous consolidation should support the collaboration of multiple actors (IT and SSH) providing both sample data and knowledge to the collaborative framework.
Time and space are core aspects of the history of cultural heritage collections. In addition to the audio-visual appearance, digitisation will include the related cultural, historical, social evolution and events. It will need to develop the accessibility of the semantic content of the resources. Through connecting the tangible and intangible, stories will emerge as a means to enhance our understanding of cultural heritage.

Expected Impact:
(2018):
New technologies and methods will help to present cultural heritage in a comprehensive and attractive way, thereby supporting the promotion and understanding of Europe’s cultural heritage. Proposals will also demonstrate how improved preservation of objects, collections and sites will enhance cultural history and cultural tourism. The economic, social, research and cultural impact for content-owning creative industries and cultural institutions will include gains from use and re-use of digital assets. Proposals will also show how they will enhance re-use of digital assets.
(2020):
The proposals should demonstrate how the new technologies, methods and data formats would help to present cultural and historic remains and memories in a comprehensive and attractive though scientifically based way, supporting the promotion of Europe’s cultural heritage. Proposals should also show how the preservation and analysis of the tangible and intangible resources of our cultural heritage would enhance our understanding of cultural history. They should also deliver solutions to the problem that language change hampers static ways of retrieving the information from historic data collections. The economic impact for the creative industries and the scientific impact for cultural institutions who own content will include gains from use and re-use of digital assets.
The main area of expected impact will be in the better promotion of Europe’s cultural heritage, such as through presenting cultural and historic remains and memories (in a comprehensive and attractive way using new technologies, methods and data formats, including solutions to the problem of language when retrieving information from historic data collections. Curating digital assets will also offer the opportunity to preserve study and disseminate the memory of cultural heritage that underwent dispersal or destroyed. The preservation and analysis of the tangible and intangible resources of our cultural heritage will enhance our understanding of cultural history, and bring economic impact for creative industries and for cultural institutions owning content, such as from the use and re-use of digital assets.

","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Museums and cultural organisations have been hit by the COVID-19 crisis, some of them significantly, by the loss in revenues. At the same time, the crisis has speeded up the digital transformation of the sector[1]. Digital technologies become central to almost every aspect of the work of museums to meet the new realities. On the one hand, digital means can offer solutions in relation to museums’ functions, from the collection of artefacts to their conservation and study, and from the interpretation and exhibition of museum collections to marketing and to managing online and onsite visitors. On the other hand, there is a huge potential for innovation and experimentation using advanced technologies and for collaboration between the cultural, creative and technology sectors, in an inclusive way. Investing in digital technologies is essential for museums to innovate and to adapt to new circumstances.
Scope:
The proposed action will provide the opportunity for museums to work with creative and technology partners, as well as with each other, through small, experimental projects, to apply digital technologies to a selected area of work or activities, in an innovative way. The project will support museums, for example and not exclusively, to develop solutions that enhance their digital presence, or innovate their day-to-day functions and processes, experiment with 3D digitization and AR/VR applications for visitors, tap in the creative potential of technology to offer transformative experiences for audiences, or test new business models for their post-crisis recovery.
The action will be implemented through a number of individual projects in selected museums, representing good geographical balance across Europe. The action is targeted in particular to small and medium sized museums. Participating museums can choose to experiment in any application area they wish, but variation in the application areas across participating museums is encouraged.
The action will lead to a collaborative project structure for museums and cultural organisations in Europe, where the outcomes and the detailed documentation of the implemented individual projects will be shared through a cloud-based collaboration and innovation space, to serve as examples of reference, best practice and source of know-how for the museum sector.
The action will work together with existing initiatives that support the digital transformation of the cultural heritage sector, such as Europeana, the European digital platform for cultural heritage, and the European Competence Centre for the preservation and conservation of Monuments and Sites.
The action may also investigate the potential of further development and expansion under the Horizon Europe programme, by evaluating the challenges and opportunities of scaling up.
Proposals are expected to use financial support to third parties (FSTP) to support museums for the experimental projects, in line with the conditions set out in Part K of the General Annexes, duly justified as a means to achieving the overall objectives. The consortium will define criteria for a fair and objective process for selecting museums. At least 60% of the budget is expected to be dedicated to FSTP and the maximum amount of FSTP, distributed through a grant, is EUR 30.000 per third party for the entire action duration but smaller amounts may also be justified.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU in the order of EUR 1 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
The action will promote collaboration and innovation in cultural organisations, primarily in the museum sector, at European level. It will offer the opportunity for museums, especially smaller and medium ones, to make the most of digital technologies and services to innovate their digital processes and digital presence, acquire and share know-how through collaboration, experimentation and shared practices, and potentially develop solutions contributing to their financial recovery. Participating museums are expected to develop skills and expertise through their dedicated project, while a shared collaboration and innovation space with good practices, examples of reference and common knowledge will foster capacity building and innovation in the museum sector in a wider and more inclusive way.

Specific Challenge: Around a quarter of the existing building stock in Europe was built prior to the middle of the last century.  Many such buildings,often valued for their cultural, architectural and historic significance not only reflect the unique character and identity of European cities but include essential infrastructure for housing, public buildings etc.  A significant number of these historic buildings continue to use conventional inefficient fossil-fuel based energy systems typically associated with high energy costs and with greater than average CO2 emissions and cost of refurbishment.
The need to save costs increasingly leads to tighter rationing or shutdown of heating or cooling systems, further worsening conditions for conservation of the buildings, for artworks or collections as well as for living conditions. 
Furthermore, changes in building-se and higher indoor comfort expectations than in the past is driving up demand for energy, a particular challenge when buildings of historic value are used or converted for residential, educational, retail, office or other purposes.
Due to the need to preserve authenticity and integrity, many recently developed solutions in the field of renovation are not compatible with or adequately adapted for use in historic buildings. This is particularly the case for listed or protected buildings.
It is also difficult to fully assess and model reliably the energy performance of the many different types of historic buildings across Europe or to assess the effect of energy efficiency measures or more sustainable solutions.
The scope for improved energy-efficiency of historic buildings is significant if addressed by holistic[1], and deep[2] renovation schemes that integrate innovative technologies, adapted standards and methodologies which consider the district dimension and stakeholder involvement.
Energy strategies and solutions for historic buildings have been identified as one of the priority areas in the roadmap of the EeB PPP.
Scope:
Project proposals should focus on the development of innovative and affordable building renovation solutions for historic buildings that can deliver significant[3] improvements in energy performance while ensuring indoor comfort requirements, non-invasive, reversible solutions.
The emphasis should be on eco-innovation and sustainability by integrating cost-effective technologies for energy efficiency and renewable energy solutions.
Projects may address specific aspects such as innovative energy and environmental assessment methodologies (based on life-cycle and including specific non-monetary aspects in the cost/benefit and return on investment analysis), tools for planning and implementing the  renovation of historic buildings, monitoring and control technologies and systems, non-invasive and non-destructive methods of surveying and diagnosis together with appropriate standards and information management for building maintenance.
Projects should clearly demonstrate the effectiveness of the technologies, methodologies, systems or tools developed and to prove the replication potential of the proposed solutions with, where appropriate, the use of case studies.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 3 and 5 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
This topic will be implemented under the PPP on Energy-efficient Buildings. The activities are expected to be implemented at TRL 4-6 (please see part G of the General Annexes).
Expected Impact: Optimised design and implementation of renovation projects for historic buildings and for listed and protected buildings in particular, delivering significant improvements in energy performance at both building and district level through more tailored solutions. Provision of effective guidelines and contribution to standardisation activities in this field. Reduced fragmentation in this sector through increased collaboration and cooperation and fostering of a more interdisciplinary approach and support to the implementation of the roadmap of the EeB PPP.

Deadline date","Scope:
Specific challenge: The large contribution expected from the building sector to the 2020 energy objectives is a challenge for the construction industry which needs to be ready to deliver renovations offering high energy performance and new, nearly zero-energy buildings using innovative technologies. Many craftsmen and building workers need up-skilling. Existing qualification schemes, accreditation structures and training incentives are not covering enough energy efficiency and renewable energy issues and are sometimes insufficiently attractive to building workers and employers (especially from SMEs). There is also a need to train architects, engineers, building managers and other building professionals. By promoting 'energy literacy', including integrated design and good operational management practices, these professions can help in closing the gap between energy performance at design stage and operational performance.
Scope:Regarding craftsmen and other on-site workers, including apprentices, proposals should build on the results of the recent BUILD UP Skills initiative, be in line with the European Qualification Framework (EQF), and focus on upgrading or establishing large-scale qualification and training schemes in order to increase the number of skilled building workers. They should be based on the national training roadmaps established in BUILD UP Skills. They may also address coordination and accompanying measures (e.g. voluntary certification schemes, accreditation, mutual recognition, incentives to encourage the participation of craftsmen and to attract women to the construction sector).
Regarding other practitioners, proposals should focus on improving the qualification and skills of middle and senior level building professionals. ICT-based training may be used, building on results from the EU ICT programme.
For financial support to trainees, proposals should link to other sources of funding such as the European Social Fund, including the Youth Guarantee Scheme.
Proposals should as much as possible foster better cooperation between disciplines and link to approved qualifications which are in turn based on industry standards.
Organisational and financial mechanisms should be established to sustain training activities for at least 3 years after the projects’ end.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 1 and 1.5 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
For all proposals, at least three legal entities must participate in the action; each of the three legal entities shall be established in a different eligible country; and all three legal entities shall be independent of each other. However, proposals focusing on upgrading or establishing large-scale qualification and training schemes for craftsmen and other on-site workers, in the continuation of the BUILD UP Skills initiative, may be submitted by one legal entity.
Expected impact: Reduced skills mismatch and increased managerial capacity to support innovation and sustainable energy use in buildings through new leadership and work practices. Improved participation, qualifications and skills for a pool of talented women in the construction sector.
Every million Euro of EU support is expected to increase the skills of at least 2000 craftsmen[1], or 500 construction sector managers[2], resulting in energy savings and/or renewable energy production of at least 25 GWh per year and increasing the employability of the building workforce. In addition projects should explain how they will result in increased investments in innovative sustainable energy technologies.

Deadline date","Scope:
Specific challenge: The Energy Performance of Buildings Directive and the Energy Efficiency Directive contain provisions to increase renovation rates, especially for public buildings. However non-technological barriers hamper the implementation of these provisions and also prevent other market actors in the residential and private sectors from following the example that the public sector is expected to set.
The heterogeneity of the construction industry, the large number of companies and the relative lack of quality standards and inspection protocols and guidelines limit the number and impact of large-scale energy efficiency investments and the effective integration of renewable energies. Many buildings are not commissioned and/or operated properly and energy performance certificates have not yet gained full public acceptance. The pressure to build or renovate towards nearly zero-energy buildings means that the building sector needs to significantly upgrade its working practices.
In addition there is a need to develop a marketplace for deep renovation[1] packages. Currently, there is limited articulated demand from building owners for significant energy performance improvements in existing buildings. Supply side, demand side and public authorities need to cooperate and find solutions that drive compelling offers for building owners, and lift as many barriers as possible simultaneously.
Scope: Proposals should focus on removing market barriers. They should focus on coherent interventions across issues and across actors to drive structural improvement in market conditions (i.e. those able to significantly influence buildings energy use in different sectors including building owners/operators, public authorities, construction and maintenance industry, housing associations, developers, financiers, etc.). All building types may be covered; however the main focus should be on existing buildings, in particular the most inefficient ones, as they represent the largest savings potential. Proposals should create synergies by incorporating at least one of the following three elements:
Driving product and process innovation in the construction sector to improve product offerings by creating an early market.
Development, testing and/or implementation of regulations; property valuation techniques; decision-making tools for renovation strategies; quality standards; and/or inspection and monitoring mechanisms to bridge the gap between expected and actual energy performance.
Enabling conditions to finance deep renovation of buildings (including through process and organisation innovation).
Optional additional activities may include:
Support for the implementation of the recast Energy Performance of Buildings Directive in Member States by promoting dialogue and exchange of best practices; complementing activities of the EPBD Concerted Action[2].
Support to the implementation of the Energy Efficiency Directive as regards its provisions on 'long-term strategies for mobilising investment in the renovation of the national stock of residential and commercial buildings' (Article 4) and the renovation of central government buildings' (Article 5); complementing activities of the EED Concerted Action[3]. Proposals should not replace activities that are under the responsibility of Member States but add European value to these activities (e.g. exchange of knowledge and experience between organisations from different countries).
         Methods to increase the share of on-site and nearby-generated renewable energy in order to achieve nearly zero-energy buildings performance levels (or better).
 The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 1.5 and 2 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected impact: proposals triggering the renovation of existing buildings towards high energy performance, or raising quality and compliance, should result in savings of at least 25 GWh/year per million EUR of EU support. Impacts should also be measured in terms of investment made by stakeholders in sustainable energy; better implementation of energy-efficiency policies; and number of policy makers or building owners/operators influenced.
Type of action: Coordination and Support Actions
[1] Deep (or major) renovation means the renovation of a building where: (a) the total cost of the renovation relating to the building envelope or the technical building systems is higher than 25 % of the value of the building, excluding the value of the land upon which the building is situated; or  (b) more than 25 % of the surface of the building envelope undergoes renovation (Energy Performance of Buildings Directive)
