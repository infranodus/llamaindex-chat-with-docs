","Coordination and support action

","single-stage
Deadline date","Scope:
Specific challenge: The Energy Performance of Buildings Directive and the Energy Efficiency Directive contain provisions to increase renovation rates, especially for public buildings. However non-technological barriers hamper the implementation of these provisions and also prevent other market actors in the residential and private sectors from following the example that the public sector is expected to set.
The heterogeneity of the construction industry, the large number of companies and the relative lack of quality standards and inspection protocols and guidelines limit the number and impact of large-scale energy efficiency investments and the effective integration of renewable energies. Many buildings are not commissioned and/or operated properly and energy performance certificates have not yet gained full public acceptance. The pressure to build or renovate towards nearly zero-energy buildings means that the building sector needs to significantly upgrade its working practices.
In addition there is a need to develop a marketplace for deep renovation[1] packages. Currently, there is limited articulated demand from building owners for significant energy performance improvements in existing buildings. Supply side, demand side and public authorities need to cooperate and find solutions that drive compelling offers for building owners, and simultaneously lift as many barriers as possible.
Scope: Proposals should focus on removing market barriers. They should focus on coherent interventions across issues and across actors to drive structural improvement in market conditions (i.e. those able to significantly influence buildings energy use in different sectors including building owners/operators, public authorities, construction and maintenance industry, housing associations, developers, financiers, etc.). All building types may be covered; however the main focus should be on existing buildings, in particular the most inefficient ones, as they represent the largest savings potential. Proposals should create synergies by incorporating at least one of the following three elements:
Driving product and process innovation in the construction sector to improve product offerings by creating an early market.
Development, testing and/or implementation of regulations; property valuation techniques; decision-making tools for renovation strategies; quality standards; and/or inspection and monitoring mechanisms to bridge the gap between expected and actual energy performance.
Enabling conditions to finance deep renovation of buildings (including through process and organisation innovation).
Optional additional activities may include:
Support for the implementation of the recast Energy Performance of Buildings Directive in Member States by promoting dialogue and exchange of best practices; complementing activities of the EPBD Concerted Action[2].
Support to the implementation of the Energy Efficiency Directive as regards its provisions on 'long-term strategies for mobilising investment in the renovation of the national stock of residential and commercial buildings' (Article 4) and the renovation of central government buildings' (Article 5); complementing activities of the EED Concerted Action[3]. Proposals should not replace activities that are under the responsibility of Member States but add European value to these activities (e.g. exchange of knowledge and experience between organisations from different countries).
Methods to increase the share of on-site and nearby-generated renewable energy in order to achieve nearly zero-energy buildings performance levels (or better).
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 1.5 and 2 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected impact: proposals triggering the renovation of existing buildings towards high energy performance, or raising quality and compliance, should result in savings of at least 25 GWh/year per million EUR of EU support. Impacts should also be measured in terms of investment made by stakeholders in sustainable energy; better implementation of energy-efficiency policies; and number of policy makers or building owners/operators influenced.

","single-stage
Deadline date","Scope:
Specific challenge: While public authorities have an important role to play to develop energy efficiency policies and plans, the latter require the full involvement of private stakeholders and the civil society for their effective implementation. However there is a general lack of capacity and coordination among those stakeholders to guarantee their full involvement and to effectively convert policies and plans into concrete actions.
Scope: Proposals should target specific actors among a wide spectrum of stakeholders (utilities, industry, financing institutions, non-governmental organisations, consumer associations, interest groups, trade unions, etc). They should provide large-scale capacity building or engagement activities to those specific groups playing a key role in the definition and/or implementation of sustainable energy policies and measures initiated by public authorities. Proposals should demonstrate a strong European added value and put in place mechanisms ensuring the continuation of the activities beyond the project duration.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 1 and 1.5 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected impact:Each projectmust prove to influence hundreds of stakeholders playing a key role in the definition and successful implementation of national, regional or local policies. As a result the number of final consumers impacted should be measured in thousands of people.

Specific challenge:residential use of energy is responsible for 28% of EU energy consumption[1]. The barriers to consumer energy saving have been known for more than 30 years[2] but are still present, in particular split incentives (e.g. tenants vs. landlords), lack of information, high initial investment in energy-efficient equipment and habits of energy users. Likewise, while awareness of the existence of renewable energies has improved considerably in the last years, there is still a lack of understanding of how to use them in practice.
Scope:Projectproposals should focus on changing the behaviour of consumers in their everyday life (e.g. at home, at work, at school), using market segmentation and focussing on 'action', the last step of the AIDA (Awareness – Interest – Desire – Action) framework. Equipment responsible for main energy consumption (e.g. heating and cooling, lighting, domestic appliances, and consumer electronics)[3], as well as products from the small scale renewable energy market, should be addressed in priority. Educational activities or tools (such as comparative ones) may be necessary, e.g. to help consumers read and understand their energy bills or labels; to help them take advantage of ICT devices and tools to monitor and analyse their energy use; to increase trust in individual smart meters or energy audits; or to help them participate in community renewable energy projects (e.g. RES consumer cooperatives, community-owned projects, etc.). Actions should take gender issues into account when relevant and involve manufacturers, retailers and consumer associations when these can play a decisive role. The use of social innovations and innovative technologies (e.g. smart meters/appliances/ICT) should be considered when it brings added value, especially when addressing the younger generation. More fundamental activities aimed at a better understanding of consumers' and other stakeholders' perception, motivation and behaviour are part of the scope (e.g. understanding of product labels and building certificates, difference in patterns of consumption for women and men) provided their results can directly lead to improvements in the effectiveness of consumer-driven initiatives.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 1 and 1.5 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected impact:Bigger market share of the most energy-efficient products (from the highest energy class) and/or of high quality renewable energy products. For example, each million € of EU support in energy efficiency actions is expected to deliver annual energy savings of around 10% for at least 5,000 households[4] (around 8 GWh/year of savings[5]). In any case proposals should demonstrate significant impacts in terms of number of people changing their behaviour and taking informed investment decisions.

Deadline date","Scope:
Specific challenge: Sub-optimal levels of investment in sustainable energy (in particular energy efficiency) are linked to a lack of trust of investors and financiers in the financial viability of sustainable energy measures, a lack of capacity in the public and private sectors to structure their projects, split incentives (e.g. rental buildings), and a lack of large-scale successful flagship projects. New bank capital requirements[1] have decreased banks´ lending capacity and willingness to invest in the sustainable energy sector, which is still deemed by many to be risky
The financial sector needs to be convinced to develop new financing products and practices that can respond to the constraints of the market.
Scope: Project proposals and activities should foster dialogue with and between financial market actors, standardisation and valuation entities, industry, public authorities, consumers and property owners. They should lead to development of new business models and financial products, ensuring synergies of public and private finance.
Proposals focusing on the development of frameworks for standardisation and benchmarking of investments, such as labelling and standardisation of sustainable energy investments / portfolios, or valuation techniques integrating the 'green value' of buildings. Proposals integrated in a broader approach such as socially responsible investment or 'green buildings' should focus on the energy component.
Proposals targeting public institutional investors (e.g. public or semi-public pension schemes) in order to increase the share of their funds invested in sustainable energy, or to develop specific funds or investment products.
Proposals aiming to create EU and national sustainable energy financing platforms to organise dialogue with the relevant stakeholders and (among others) develop roadmaps, propose improvements in the legal frameworks and develop template documents and contracts leading to a better understanding of the market. Proposals must include a clear action plan to communicate across Europe towards potential replicators. The mechanism for knowledge sharing between countries will be established by the Commission services.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 0.5 and 2 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
For all proposals, at least three legal entities must participate in the action; each of the three legal entities shall be established in a different eligible country; and all three legal entities shall be independent of each other. However, proposals aiming to create national sustainable energy financing platforms may be submitted by one entity.
Expected impact: Proposals should lead to reduced uncertainty as regards investments into sustainable energy in terms of increased investors' confidence and trust. Further, relevant projects should deliver innovative (and relevant) asset valuation methodologies agreed by the market and/or standardised descriptions of sustainable energy investments or measures/contracts and/or labelling schemes or harmonised frameworks for sustainable energy investments and/or National strategies for financing sustainable energy investments.

","single-stage
Deadline date","Scope:
Specific challenge: Between 2000 and 2010, energy efficiency in industry has on average improved by 1.3% per year[1]. However by using existing cost-effective energy solutions, the industry sector could further reduce its consumption by at least 13%[2], thus gaining in competitiveness and save nearly 40 Mtoe a year. Obtaining larger savings in industry can also be achieved by introducing new affordable intelligent energy solutions that secures more uptime in production chains.
Scope: Activities should focus on removing market barriers, in particular the lack of expertise and information on energy management. Proposals should primarily address the uptake of cross-cutting innovative technologies, such as energy efficient electric motor driven systems and steam/hot water generation, because these represent 75% of the potential savings in industry[3]. They should also consider total-site energy management schemes and system optimization methodologies to identify saving potentials, monitor progress, and design energy recovery and energy storage solutions. Proposals should put in place mechanisms to secure funding for energy efficiency investments and facilitate the continuation of the activities beyond the project lifetime. The use of renewable energies and waste heat recovery should be encouraged where it is cost-effective. Energy-intensive industries should be prioritised as they account for 70% of industrial energy use. Processes (e.g. drying) which represent a relatively high share of energy consumption in industry should also be considered where appropriate.
The following areas or their combination are also eligible for funding:
Industrial systems efficiency benchmarking: Devise methods and tools including ICT to compare and benchmark the energy performance of industrial systems and processes, and develop guidelines for tailored measures, in particular in energy-intensive industries. Such methods and tools should be based on existing standards where applicable.
Development of sector-specific technology pathways towards 2050 to target the most energy-intensive industrial sectors
Energy management in SMEs and industry: Improve the availability of skilled energy auditors and energy managers and the diffusion of energy management systems and best practices. Develop instruments to ensure the availability of updated, comprehensive and usable information on energy efficiency for industries. Address the issue of access to finance for the actual implementation of energy efficiency upgrades.
Human and organizational challenges: Analysis of motivations, behaviour, perception, and barriers for the involved actors (from decision makers to employees) in the sector, and knowledge about organizational factors influencing energy efficiency.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 1.5 and 2 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected impact: for capacity building projects, every million Euro of EU support is expected to increase the skills of hundreds of people working in the sector, resulting in savings of at least 25 GWh per year. All proposals should demonstrate a significant impact in terms of improved competitiveness; larger investments made by stakeholders in sustainable energy; primary energy savings; better implementation of energy-efficiency policies; number of policy makers influenced; number of people with increased skills; and/or number of people changing their behaviour.

Deadline date","Scope:
Specific challenge: Buyers of energy-related products can foster innovation by specifying energy performance levels that are higher than the best levels available on the market. The larger the group of buyers, the higher is the potential market and therefore the greater is the interest of manufacturers to meet more ambitious product specifications and to deliver new more energy efficient products. This market-transformation tool, commonly referred to as 'technology procurement', has been applied successfully to a few products such as copiers, electric motors and cold appliances but it could be applied to many more energy-related products if more buyers knew how to use it.
Scope: Actions whereby groups of buyers are established and together set higher-than-available performance levels which manufacturers of sustainable energy productsare called to meet through product innovation. Products should represent a large potential for meeting the EU energy policy targets and have the potential for a large market demand.  Buyer groups should be large and influential and/or composed of market leaders. Technical specifications should be ambitious but achievable without large investments in research and development and without distorting competition between manufacturers of products with the same level of energy performance. It is important that the technology procurement process is associated with communication activities to encourage manufacturers to participate and to make their results more visible.
Proposals addressing the procurement of products that already exist on the market should be submitted under topic EE8.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 1.5 and 2 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact: New energy-using or -producing products with at least 25% better performance than best available products. Improved competitiveness of manufacturers. Creation of influential buyer groups able to transform the appliances market.

","single-stage
Deadline date","Scope:
Specific challenge: Sub-optimal levels of investment in sustainable energy (in particular energy efficiency) are linked to a lack of trust of investors and financiers in the financial viability of sustainable energy measures, a lack of capacity in the public and private sectors to structure their projects, split incentives (e.g. rental buildings), and a lack of large-scale successful flagship projects. New bank capital requirements[1] have decreased banks´ lending capacity and willingness to invest in the sustainable energy sector, which is still deemed by many to be risky
The financial sector needs to be convinced to develop new financing products and practices that can respond to the constraints of the market.
Scope: Project proposals and activities should foster dialogue with and between financial market actors, standardisation and valuation entities, industry, public authorities, consumers and property owners. They should lead to development of new business models and financial products, ensuring synergies of public and private finance.
Proposals focusing on the development of frameworks for standardisation and benchmarking of investments, such as labelling and standardisation of sustainable energy investments / portfolios, or valuation techniques integrating the 'green value' of buildings. Proposals integrated in a broader approach such as socially responsible investment or 'green buildings' should focus on the energy component.
Proposals targeting public institutional investors (e.g. public or semi-public pension schemes) in order to increase the share of their funds invested in sustainable energy, or to develop specific funds or investment products.
Proposals aiming to create EU and national sustainable energy financing platforms to organise dialogue with the relevant stakeholders and (among others) develop roadmaps, propose improvements in the legal frameworks and develop template documents and contracts leading to a better understanding of the market. Proposals must include a clear action plan to communicate across Europe towards potential replicators. The mechanism for knowledge sharing between countries will be established by the Commission services.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 0.5 and 2 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
For all proposals, at least three legal entities must participate in the action; each of the three legal entities shall be established in a different eligible country; and all three legal entities shall be independent of each other. However, proposals aiming to create national sustainable energy financing platforms may be submitted by one entity.
Expected impact: Proposals should lead to reduced uncertainty as regards investments into sustainable energy in terms of increased investors' confidence and trust. Further, relevant projects should deliver innovative (and relevant) asset valuation methodologies agreed by the market and/or standardised descriptions of sustainable energy investments or measures/contracts and/or labelling schemes or harmonised frameworks for sustainable energy investments and/or National strategies for financing sustainable energy investments.

","Research and Innovation action
","24 September 2014
","single-stage
Deadline date","Scope:
Specific challenge: There is yet considerable potential and room for development in the use of virtual research environments. The objective is to address this challenge by supporting capacity building in interdisciplinary research communities to empower researchers through development and deployment of service-driven digital research environments, services and tools tailored to their specific needs. These virtual research environments (VRE) should integrate resources across all layers of the e-infrastructure (networking, computing, data, software, user interfaces), should foster cross-disciplinary data interoperability and should provide functions allowing data citation and promoting data sharing and trust.
Scope: Each VRE should abstract from the underlying e-infrastructures using standardised building blocks and workflows, well documented interfaces, in particular regarding APIs, and interoperable components. Over time VREs will be composed of generic services delivered by e-infrastructures and domain specific services co-developed and co-operated by researchers, technology and e-infrastructure providers, and possibly commercial vendors.
The VRE proposals should clearly identify and build on requirements from real use cases, e.g. for integration of heterogeneous data from multiple sources and value-added services for computing, modelling, simulation, and data exploration, mining and visualisation, taking due account of privacy aspects. They should re-use tools and services from existing infrastructures and projects at national and/or European level as appropriate.
Where data are concerned, projects will define the semantics, ontologies, the 'what' metadata, as well as the best computing models and levels of abstraction (e.g. by means of open web services) to process the rich semantics at machine level (the so called 'how' metadata), as to ensure interoperability. They may also support proof of concept, prototyping and deployment of advanced data services and environments, and access to top-of-the-range connectivity and computing.
VREs may target any area of science and technology, especially interdisciplinary ones, including ICT, mathematics, web science and social sciences and humanities. Focusing on the ICT infrastructures needed for addressing the Societal Challenges is especially encouraged. Proposals should indicate the number of researchers they target as potential users.
This topic is complementary with topic INFRADEV-4-2014/2015, as VREs integrate data, network and computing resources for interdisciplinary research communities, whereas INFRADEV-4-2014/2015 addresses interoperability of services and common solutions for cluster of ESFRI and other research infrastructure initiatives in thematic areas.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 2 and 8 million would allow this topic to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected impact:  VREs are expected to result in more effective collaboration between researchers and higher efficiency and creativity in research as well as in higher productivity of researchers thanks to reliable and easy access to discovery, access and re-use of data. They will  accelerate innovation in research via an integrated access to potentially unlimited digital research resources, tools and services across disciplines and user communities and enable researchers to process structured and qualitative data in virtual and/or ubiquitous workspaces. They will contribute to increased take-up of collaborative research and data sharing by new disciplines, research communities and institutions.

","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
The global food supply chain is facing a complex set of challenges.
On the demand side, the situation is characterised by an increasing world population, by an increasing standard of living (especially in the emerging countries) creating demand for a more varied, high-quality diet requiring additional food production. As a result the UN has predicted that food demand will rise by around 70 % by 2050 ( 1 - Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations (FAO). 2009. Global agriculture towards 2050. ). At the same time, the fast expansion of the bioenergy sector further accentuates the demand for by-products derived from the food production process.
On the supply side, global climate change will aggravate pressures on food production and food supply. In addition, a number of food production systems in the world are unsustainable. Without change, the global food system will continue to degrade the environment and compromise the world's capacity to produce food in the future.
These problems in particular have to be seen in connection with consumers' attitudes, concerns and behaviours, as production is driven by consumers and markets. During the last two decades the complexity of food consumption has increased dramatically. Consumers demand affordable, diversified, high quality and convenient food products responding to their tastes and needs. Concerns regarding various issues, ranging from food safety and environmental protection to ethical considerations, such as fair trading practices or animal welfare, are continuously increasing and result in growing demands by consumer groups for political action. Finally, food consumption habits (including food wastage) can have strong impacts on consumer health and well-being, as well as on primary production and on the environment.
Horizon 2020 addresses this complexity and defines the challenges relating to this sector: ""The challenge is to secure supplies of safe and high quality food and bio-based products and to ensure sustainable management of biological resources, contributing to both rural and coastal development and to competitiveness of the European biobased industries, while preserving terrestrial and marine eco-systems, reducing fossil-dependency, mitigating and adapting to climate change and promoting zero-waste and resource efficiency.""
Expected Impact:
RELEVANCE AND IMPACT
A KIC on a sustainable supply chain will help meeting Horizon 2020 priorities, namely those defined in the context of the societal challenge ""Food security, sustainable agriculture and forestry, marine and maritime and inland water research and the bio-economy"".
This thematic field is in addition highly relevant in terms of economic and societal impact. Questions of food safety and security have a bearing on nearly all sectors of our economy and society, and very often call for regulatory action.
The food industry is the largest manufacturing sector in Europe and plays an essential role in Europe's wider economic development. Despite its relevant role, the competitiveness of the European food and drink industry is being challenged. Over the last decade, Europe's share of the global market has declined from 25 % to 21 % in the face of competition from emerging economies, such as China, India and Brazil. Increasingly unable to compete on cost alone, the European food industry needs to be able to add value by creating healthier, more sustainable and resource-efficient products if it is to reverse this decline.
Action is needed to ensure a climate resilient and sustainable global food system while meeting the increasing food demand within the constraints of available land and declining fish stocks, protecting the natural environment and safeguarding human health.
A KIC in this area will focus on the food supply chain. This focus lends itself particularly well to the holistic approach of a KIC. It comprises resource input in the very beginning of the chain (fertilisers, etc.), food production, processing, packaging and distribution; and it ends with the consumers which might be a specific priority of a KIC (reduction of food waste, healthy nutrition, etc.). The objective is to ensure a more efficient and effective food supply chain system, while improving the sustainability and traceability in all parts of this chain.
Addressing the food supply chain via a KIC will thus give the possibility to address not only some of the major economic and societal relevant challenges Europe is facing, but also to mobilise investment and long-term commitment from the business sector – namely, in the deployment of new and innovative technologies, processes and knowledge to increase sustainable food production, processing, packaging and distribution, to reduce waste and promote better nutrition. Through its integrative approach, a KIC in this area will be able to influence the industry approach to focus more on consumer-driven innovation, thereby benefiting consumer health and quality of life. This will go along with the potential of new business models and market strategies that focus on consumers' needs and trends and build upon enhanced awareness of the food chain, which can have potential to get innovations and technological possibilities in line with consumer interests and thus create new business opportunities.
A KIC in this area will be very important to overcome the high level of fragmentation of the whole food supply chain. It will blend a critical mass of excellent research, innovation, education and training stakeholders along the whole chain. All elements of the chain (primary sector, food production, food processors, retailers, food service channels and – not least – the consumer) are inextricably linked to each other for the conception of future innovations. A KIC will provide the necessary systemic and transdiciplinary approach to tackle these issues.
The major added value of a KIC in this area will be its role in addressing the current shortage of skills and human resources. Currently, probably as many as half of the European food and beverage manufacturing industries are facing a shortage in scientific and skilled personnel. This is a barrier to innovation in this sector. By integrating education with the other sectors of the knowledge triangle, a KIC will address this issue. It will at the same time offer the opportunity to stimulate new educated entrepreneurial people, capable of developing new innovative technologies and business. This focus on entrepreneurship would be particularly relevant in the food sector, which is characterised by a high number of SMEs.
The major risks associated to the success of a KIC under this theme are mainly related to the necessary accompanying innovation framework conditions, which KICs are not directly addressing. For increasing sustainability throughout the food supply chain, some changes in regulation may be needed in order, for example, to internalise food production costs. Therefore, the KICs need to liaise with ongoing Union and national innovation and policy activities on these matters (see next section).

SYNERGIES AND COMPLEMENTARITIES WITH EXISTING INITIATIVES
The Union is fully engaged in this field. A KIC would contribute to address Horizon 2020 societal challenge ""Food security, sustainable agriculture and forestry, marine and maritime and inland water research and the bio-economy"". It would, in particular, co-operate with the proposed European Innovation Partnership (EIP) ""Agricultural Productivity and Sustainability"". Whilst the latter will put emphasis on building bridges between cutting-edge research and practical innovation, a KIC would in particular create complementarity in educating key actors, such as entrepreneurs and consumers. Coordination is also needed, with the Joint Programming Initiative ""Agriculture, Food Security and Climate Change"", which will pool national research efforts to integrate adaptation, mitigation and food security in the agriculture, forestry and land use sectors.
The European Maritime and Fisheries Fund will promote environmental and social sustainability of fisheries and aquaculture, thus highlighting the need for technical developments coupled with new entrepreneurial skills in these fields, in line with the evolution of consumers' behaviour, providing possibilities for synergies. Likewise, coordination will also be possible with the recently launched JPI ""Healthy Food for a Healthy Life"" and ""Connecting Climate Research in Europe"", and with European Technology Platforms in relating areas (in particular, the Food for Life Platform) or numerous projects under the Seventh Framework Programme. Similarly, it would build on eco-innovation market replication projects, under the CIP (Competitiveness and Innovation Programme), where food and drink has been one of the priority areas. Such experience will continue with Horizon 2020 namely in the context of the Climate action, environment, resource efficiency and raw materials societal challenge.
A KIC in this area would be complementary to these activities since it would focus on transdisciplinary activities within the knowledge triangle with a strong focus on innovative products and services and entrepreneurial education as well as on consumer issues.
CONCLUSION
A KIC which focuses on the food supply chain is most suited to address the challenges outlined above. It also meets the criteria put forward for the selection of KIC themes:
— It addresses a major economic and societal relevant challenge (the need to ensure a resilient and sustainable food system while meeting the increasing food demand within the constraints of available land, protecting the natural environment and safeguarding human health), and contributes to the delivery of the Europe 2020 agenda and its objectives on climate and energy, employment, innovation and education.
— This KIC focus is aligned with priorities defined in Horizon 2020 and complementary with other Union activities in the food sector, in particular with the EIP ""Agricultural Productivity and Sustainability"".
— It is able to mobilise investment and long-term commitment from the businesses sector and offers possibilities for various emerging products and services – namely, in the deployment of new and innovative technologies, processes and knowledge to increase sustainable food production, processing, packaging and distribution, to reduce waste and promote better nutrition and a healthier population.
— It creates sustainable and systemic impact, measured in terms of new educated entrepreneurial people, new technologies and new business. It will foster new technological developments and more efficient and sustainable production systems.
— It aims at overcoming the high level of fragmentation of the whole food supply chain; favouring traceability; and will bring together a critical mass of excellent research, innovation, education and training stakeholders along the whole chain.
— It thus requires transdisciplinary work involving different areas of knowledge, such as agronomy, ecology, biology, chemistry, nutrition, and socio-economy.
— It will address the European paradox, since it will find new innovative approaches to ensure a more sustainable and efficient supply chain and to improve food security."

","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
One of the major challenges defined in the European Innovation Agenda and which also has to be addressed within the framework of Horizon 2020, is the competitiveness of Union Member States on the global market. One of the sectors where the problem is particularly urgent is manufacturing.
Manufacturing in European countries is under considerable strain: increased competition from other developed economies, low cost production in developing countries, and scarcity of raw materials are putting pressure on the European manufacturing companies. Parallel to this, there are further factors driving change in the manufacturing sector: new market and societal needs, rapid advances in science and technology, environmental and sustainability requirements.
One possible answer to address these challenges is the development of a ""high value (or added-value) manufacturing"" industry. This concept defines an integrated system including the whole cycle of production, distribution and end-of- life treatment of goods and products/services applying a customer/user driven innovation system. Rather than competing primarily on cost, added value manufacturers deliver value by delivering product/service innovation, establishing process excellence, achieving high brand recognition and/or contributing to a sustainable society.
The manufacturing sector is of considerable economic, social and environmental significance. In 2010 the manufacturing sector accounted for 15,4 % of the Union's GDP and over 33 million jobs. This figure increases to 37 % if power generation, construction, and associated business services are included. At the same time, manufacturing also contributed to about 25 % of the waste, 23 % of greenhouse gases and 26 % of NOx generated in Europe.
Bearing this in mind, it is quite clear that the overall objectives in the field of manufacturing must be increased competitiveness of Europe within the global market as well as the development of more sustainable and environment- friendly manufacturing processes.
Expected Impact:
RELEVANCE AND IMPACT
A KIC on added-value manufacturing will help meeting Horizon 2020 priorities in terms of advanced manufacturing and processing, and its specific objective of ""transforming today's industrial forms of production towards more knowledge intensive, sustainable, low-emission, trans-sectoral manufacturing and processing technologies, to realise innovative products, processes and services"".
It will be able to mobilise investment and long-term commitment from the business sector, and to expand and create new markets. It could have in particular a function in supporting the actions defined in the Strategic Research Agenda of the European Technology Platform (ETP) ""Manufuture"":
— Eco-design
— Development of added-value products and services;
— Development of new business models;
— Development of advanced manufacturing engineering processes;
— New emerging manufacturing sciences and technologies;
— Transformation of existing research and education infrastructures to support world-class manufacturing.
Whilst supporting the development of new products, services, business models and manufacturing processes, emphasis should be put on sustainability and eco-innovation, with the reduction of resource and energy inefficiencies, maximising positive environmental impacts, but also contributing to strengthening positive economic and social impacts. Concretely, such clean approach will imply energy and material efficient processes and machinery, the use of renewable power sources, and/or the employment of smart energy management, leading thus to significant reductions of waste and emissions. By contributing to the development and deployment of more sustainable, resource-efficient and competitive manufacturing, a KIC would be able to trigger industry and consumers behavioural change and to create systemic impact.
A KIC on added-value manufacturing could also have a very important role and impact at regional level: Fostering the creation of interconnected regional clusters with local transfers and collaboration, developing competences in high- end manufacturing technologies, and developing excellence in manufacturing technologies would be the key missions of a KIC at regional level. In this connection, specific attention could be given to those regions more affected by declining manufacturing capacity as well as to SMEs.
One of the major challenges for reaching the above aims is the availability of a highly qualified workforce which is sufficient in quality as well as in numbers. A KIC would therefore have a very important role to play in re-shaping the education landscape in this field. By creating closer links between skills demanders and education providers, a KIC would promote joint post-graduate degrees, post-graduate professional training and industrial ""real-life"" courses.
Capacity-building will be also a central element of a KIC in added-value manufacturing. This concerns not only the supply of high qualified work force, but also the possibility of establishing the KIC as a forum for interaction and promotion of cross-disciplinary skills and competences, particularly for the combination of multiple key enabling technologies as proposed by the High-Level Group on Key Enabling Technologies (KETs) (http://ec.europa.eu/enterprise/sectors/ict/files/kets/hlg_report_final_en.pdf).
A KIC on this area will have the potential to bring together different actors and stakeholders in this very transdisciplinary sector, including key upstream and downstream parts of the value chain. This includes processing industries (e.g. steel or chemicals) which are immediately linked with the value chain for added-value manufacturing.

SYNERGIES AND COMPLEMENTARITIES WITH EXISTING INITIATIVES
A KIC as described above would be complementary to a number of other Union initiatives, as well as at the level of Member States and industry associations.
In addition to the already mentioned ETP ""Manufuture"", it could also establish links with the ETPs on Smart Systems Integration and the Joint Technology Initiative (JTI) on Embedded Computing Systems. The Public Private Partnership (PPP) on Factories of the Future and others potentially to be launched under Horizon 2020 within this thematic area as well as a number of Framework Programmes (FP) projects would also be natural co-operation partners. The KIC would take into account the research priorities and action plans defined in the framework of the ETPs and the research work carried out so far by the JTI, PPP and FP projects in this area.
Similarly, it would build on eco-innovation market replication projects, under the Competitiveness and Innovation Programme (CIP), where experience in the area of more sustainable manufacturing has been developed. Such experience will continue with Horizon 2020 namely in the context of the Climate action, environment, resource efficiency and raw materials societal challenges. Synergies may also be considered with the Environmental Technologies Verification (ETV) pilot programme, which aims at promoting high value environmental technologies by providing a third-party validation of their performance.
An added-value manufacturing KIC could be also a connection point for synergy effects with the European Technology Research Council, which the High-Level Group on Key Enabling Technologies recommends for promoting excellence in technological research and innovation.
A KIC in this area would be complementary to these activities since it would focus on transdisciplinary activities within the knowledge triangle with a strong focus on entrepreneurial education.
CONCLUSION
A KIC which focuses on the integration of all stakeholders concerned with manufacturing and which puts a strong focus on re-shaping the education agenda in this field would be well-suited to address the challenges outlined above. It also meets the criteria put forward for the selection of KIC themes in the SIA:
— It addresses a major economic and societal relevant challenge Europe is facing (to increase the competitiveness of the Member States on the global market and contribute to the development of a more sustainable and environmentally-friendly manufacturing process), and contributes to the delivery of the Europe 2020 agenda of smart and sustainable growth.
— This KIC focus is aligned with the priorities defined in Horizon 2020 and complementary with other Union activities in the area.
— It can build on a solid industrial sector which will be attracted by a KIC.
— It offers possibilities for various emerging products, services and business models, and – above all – it will be well- suited to address the urgent need for qualified people in this sector.
— It takes a systemic approach and thus requires transdisciplinary work and the development of new education across the boundaries of disciplines.
— It will bring together a critical mass of excellent research, innovation, education and training stakeholders along the value chain, which would otherwise not unite.
— It will address the European paradox, since it will capitalise on the Union's strong research base and find new innovative approaches to ensure a more competitive, sustainable and resource-efficient manufacturing sector."

Specific challenge: In order to create a world-class pan-European infrastructure, and to provide state-of-the-art services and access to this infrastructure to users, independently of location, the HPC resources in Europe need to be further pooled, integrated and rationalised.
This topic contributes to the implementation of the EU strategy on High Performance Computing (HPC), in particular by providing access to the best supercomputing facilities and services for both industry and academia, and complements the activities of the Public-Private Partnership (PPP) in HPC in order to implement the HPC strategy.
Scope: Proposals should address the following activities:
(1) Provide a seamless and efficient Tier-0 service to users Europe-wide based on promoting research excellence and innovation; this includes peer-review procedures for the allocation of computing time; transparent billing; and specific services adapted to the needs of users, including ESFRI projects, Horizon 2020 projects/programmes, large institutional users or industry. Tier-0 are those services provided at pan-European level with machines devoted to the pan-European infrastructure for a significant fraction of cycles (to be agreed with the Commission) and having a minimum performance level to be periodically defined by the consortium
(2) Carry out activities (training, service prototyping, software development etc.) that build on national HPC capabilities (Tier-1) and are necessary to support Tier-0 services or a functional European HPC ecosystem;
(3) Ensure openness to new user communities and new applications; promote industrial take-up of HPC services in particular by SMEs;
(4) Implement inclusive and equitable governance and a flexible business model to ensure long term financial sustainability; the business model should allow financial or in-kind contributions by research projects/programmes, institutions, industry and regions or countries; based on an auditable cost model for the operation of HPC Centres providing European services with different financing sources;
(5) Develop and maintain the strategy for the deployment of a rich HPC environment of world-class systems with different machine architectures - evolving towards exascale - including the implementation roadmap at EU and national level, taking into account financial aspects, best practices for reduction of operating and energy costs, and the specifications and technical requirements for a varied set of Tier-0 systems ensuring a broad coverage of user needs;
(6) Working in synergy with:
- the Centres of Excellence (see topic EINFRA-5-2015 – CoEs for computing applications);
-  the European Technology Platform for HPC; the pan-European HPC infrastructure will consult its users in order to provide technical specifications to guide research activities for future exascale prototypes and systems;
(7) Design and execute training and skills development programmes tailored to the needs of research in academia and industry and relevant public services  in order to stay at the forefront of scientific breakthroughs, as well as introduction of scientific computing and HPC in academic curricula;
(8) Develop an international cooperation policy and associated activities.
The infrastructure should provide core and basic services in coordination with other e-infrastructure providers to promote interoperability and a seamless user experience, in accordance with topic EINFRA-7-2014. Interworking with other computing infrastructures such as clouds and grids should be ensured.
Expected impact:  
         Improved services and procedures for all users to access the infrastructure and the common services, and improved allocation schemes to ensure openness to new user communities and applications;
         Increased amount of computing cycles available to researchers at European level through user-friendly and efficient procedures, helping Europe to stay at the forefront of scientific breakthroughs and innovation;
         Increased number of industrial organisations (in particular SMEs), EU projects and institutional users benefiting from access to services including training in HPC;
         Increased investment in HPC infrastructure in Europe (national, regional and EU);
         Long term financial sustainability through flexible business models and inclusive governance;

(2) Deployment and promotion of a pan-European identity federation for researchers, educators and students, in compliance with existing identity inter-federation efforts (including Eduroam and Edugain). The action will involve (research and education) institutions in EU Member States, existing identity federations, e-infrastructure providers and libraries. It should aim to overcome technical, organisational and legal obstacles for the implementation of an integrated and interoperable authentication and authorisation infrastructure (AAI) and to lower barriers for entry of organisations not already participating in identity federations, e.g. by providing scalable policy negotiation mechanisms, as well as legal guidance notably in data protection. It should also encourage the use of security token translation services to enable interoperability of different AAIs, as well as accounting services for enabling interoperability and aggregation in recording the usage of resources securely and reliably, including for the highly distributed heterogeneous infrastructures envisaged for global research data.  Guest identities and alternative methods of identification (e.g. social media identities) are encouraged e.g. in order to allow public access at large. Assessment of penetration of existing identity federations at national level and development of training activities for data professionals on issues related to AAI enabled collaboration and data sharing (data privacy, intellectual property, cultural barriers, etc.) should be foreseen.
Expected impact:
          The interoperability of e-infrastructure services is improved, therefore access to resources and collaboration between scientists are facilitated;
         Duplication of efforts for developing services common to many e-infrastructures is reduced;
         Extensive use of Digital Identifiers opens new prospects for advanced services for science and education and for encouraging openness and building trust;
         The federation of identities allows a European-wide single sign-on service enabling researchers to collaborate within secure and trusted virtual research environments where scientific resources and content can be accessed, used, stored and shared.
         The deployment of the AAI should facilitate sharing of information resources at pan-European level.
         Expansion of the coverage of national identity federations for network, services and applications; all research institutions are able to participate in identity federations even with low level of technical or organisational preparedness.

","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
The pressures currently placed on the Common European Asylum System (CEAS) by the ongoing crises in Syria, Iraq, Central and East Africa, and elsewhere are unlikely to fade away in the near future. The large scale and partially uncontrolled arrival of migrants, notably asylum seekers, in 2015 has put a strain on both European and Member States' asylum systems. It has exposed significant structural weaknesses and shortcomings in both the design and implementation of European asylum and migration policy. The current system places disproportionate responsibility on certain Member States which in fact encourages uncontrolled and irregular migration. In the future a system is needed which provides orderly and safe pathways for third country nationals in need of international protection. The specific challenge of this research action is to reassess the CEAS with a view to making any necessary recommendations. The overriding key question is to explore to what extent harmonisation of the CEAS is necessary, desirable, achievable and sustainable.
Scope:
Research is needed to comprehensively assess the weaknesses and shortcomings of the CEAS in general and of the Dublin arrangements in particular. Research will clearly differentiate between deficiencies in the legal design of the system and in its implementation. Comparative research will also investigate differences the asylum laws and policies of Member States, including their implementation under stress. In particular, research will investigate, including empirically, how much and what kind of harmonisation is required, sustainable and acceptable, and possibly outline scenarios. The relation between asylum systems and Schengen must be duly taken into consideration. Research should also study the different national political contexts as well as discourses on migration, asylum and borders. Projects will explore the causes and nature of Member States' positions on burden sharing and responsibility, especially in relation to relocation schemes.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU in the order of EUR 2 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. This does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
Findings from this research action will provide insights into the implementation and effectiveness of CEAS[1]. The research will present alternative scenarios for policy reform (e.g. differing in the extent of harmonisation and convergence) and will pronounce on what the appropriate level of harmonisation of the CEAS should be. This will equip policymakers with a range of options to respond to constantly changing circumstances.

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
In its ""Strategic Agenda for the Union in Times of Change"" for the period 2014 to 2019, the European Council identified the need to ""maximize the EU's clout"" in global affairs, notably by ""ensuring consistency between Member States' and EU foreign policy goals and by improving coordination and coherence between the main fields of EU external action, such as trade (…) development and economic policies"".[1] One area which definitely promises maximised EU clout in global affairs is trade. Given the European Union's significant weight as the world's largest trading block, its external trade policies can be a major source of a reinforced European role as a global actor if they are strategically deployed and contribute to a broader, coherent foreign policy approach. EU trade policy has to find the right balance between promoting the EU's economic interests while also taking into account broader EU policy objectives (e.g. promotion of human rights, sustainability, interlinking climate and energy policy objectives, etc.). Such a balance is difficult to achieve and the EU has sometimes been criticised either for letting its economic interests prevail or for being naïve over conditionality in the international trade battles. Coherence between the EU's and Member States' trade policy should be ensured, as well as coherence between trade and other (external) policies. To reap the strategic potential of EU external trade policy, its current functioning, as well as its intended and unintended consequences, need to be fully understood from a multidisciplinary perspective, and forward-looking perspectives have to be developed on how to make it more effective.
Scope:
Research under this topic should take stock of the European Union's and its Member States' bilateral and multilateral trade strategies and policies, comparing various regional and country-specific trade policy approaches and assessing the coherence and consistency of their objectives, strategies and instruments. Bilateral trade relations with key economic players such as the United States and China, but also developing countries from various continents should form part of such comparisons, alongside the Union's multilateral engagement in relevant international institutions, such as the World Trade Organization and its related negotiation processes and the G-20 summit as a major global economic forum. This analysis should in particular comprise detailed scrutiny of the coherence and consistency between the EU's trade policies and those of its Member States.
The results of these stock-taking should lay the foundation for an investigation of the coherence and consistency of trade policies with other EU external policies such as economic (e.g. security of energy supply, green growth), developmental (e.g. trade-related policy coherence for development), environmental (e.g. climate change mitigation, biodiversity), social and labour (e.g. international labour standards, cooperation on decent work) and human rights policies. Research should ultimately evaluate whether and how EU external trade policies can and do serve wider foreign policy objectives, identify the institutional, organisational and behavioural drivers of and obstacles to a coherent and effective strategic use of EU trade policy, and formulate propositions on how to combine trade and other external policies into a comprehensive European foreign policy. A comparative perspective, contrasting the EU's approach with the strategic use of trade policy by other major global players, could be envisaged.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting an EU contribution in the order of EUR 2.5 million would allow this specific topic to be addressed appropriately. This does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
Research under this topic will lead to a set of novel insights into the evolving EU and Member States' bi- and multilateral trade strategies and their inter-linkages with other external policies, their coherence and effectiveness. Placing trade at its centre, it will revisit and innovate the debate on coherence and consistency in EU foreign policy so as to provide an understanding of whether and how trade can be utilized strategically in the context of broader EU foreign policy agendas and in support of its foreign and economic policy objectives. Based on these policy-relevant insights, it will formulate recommendations on the institutional, organisational and behavioural adaptations needed to reinforce the EU's clout in global affairs via enhanced coherence of its foreign policy.

","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
In-spite of its undisputable importance as a region located at a strategic crossroad to the Far East, as a rich reservoir of natural resources and as an area of traditional trade relations with Europe, Central Asia has been rather neglected by the major global players in the post-Soviet era. Only in more recent years, the political and economic developments in the five countries of the region - Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan - have received more attention. Challenges related to weak governments, abuse of power and corruption, divided societies, border disputes and ethnic tensions have led to increasing political and religious militancy and the creation of extremist groups which potentially represent non-negligible suppliers of forces to the radical political and religious movements in the neighbouring countries. Today's relevance of Central Asia in general and to the trade, security and development strategies of the European Union[1] and other world powers in particular is, however, not reflected in the level of attention which the region is given from a scientific, social sciences and humanities point of view. Not only are Central Asian Studies less of a priority for European research centres, but European researchers in this field are also not sufficiently coordinated and their work is not adequately linked to policymaking.
Scope:
Taking into account the need for a more intensive and properly coordinated research in the field of Central Asian Studies and the need for closer links to EU policy making, a network of European researchers will be created which, in cooperation with researchers from Central Asian countries, will:
through mapping the current state of affairs in the field of Central Asian Studies in Europe and European Studies in Central Asia, recommend relevant new forms and priorities for future EU scientific cooperation in social sciences and the humanities with the region;
through mapping the current state of political, economic, trade, cultural and any other relations between the EU and its Member States with Central Asian countries as well as between Central Asian countries and countries in the rest of Asia, and analysing results of the existing measures and tools supporting them, recommend future priorities for European policy making. These recommendations should be prepared in close cooperation with any other relevant European and Central Asian stakeholders (e.g. local, regional and state authorities, not-for-profit sectors, representatives of businesses, etc.);
prepare an awareness-raising dissemination and communication strategy for the promotion of Central Asia and its role for Europe, which could be used by a variety of stakeholders (e.g. education, media, EU public sphere in general).
Any consortium submitting a proposal to this call should ensure a balanced representation of partners from countries in Central Asia.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU in the order of EUR 1.5 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. This does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
The coordination and support measures of this action will contribute to improving the ties of the EU with the region and countries of Central Asia in all socio-economic, political, security as well as cultural and scientific areas. Its findings will primarily be focused on the formulation of short- and long-term priorities for EU policies towards the region, as well as on proposing methods for their achievement. They will be further used for education and media purposes and thus contribute to raising awareness among EU citizens of today’s reality of the countries of Central Asia and of their importance for Europe. By creating a network of European researchers in the field of Central Asian Studies and by proposing new forms of cooperation with counterparts in Central Asia, the action will reinforce mutual research ties between the EU and Central Asian countries and establish a robust basis for their sustained collaboration.

","Research and Innovation action
","04 October 2016
","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
The importance of innovation and socio-economic aspects in sustainable urbanisation has been recognised by the EU and China in their Joint Declaration on the EU-China Partnership on Urbanisation signed in 2012, as well as in the conclusions of the EU-China Innovation Cooperation Dialogue of 2013. This topic therefore covers two specific challenges:
a) In China and elsewhere, the management of an exceptionally rapid urban growth poses considerable challenges to policy-makers and city planners. In such a delicate context, physical city planning cannot be considered in isolation from governance aspects, related for instance to land use and resources for city financing but also to the environmental human and cultural dimensions of cities. Urban infrastructures and public services also call for a balanced and integrated planning so as to minimise or avoid the negative socio-economic, human and environmental impacts on city-dwellers, migrants, and seniors. Cities are also viewed as engines of growth and innovation, often attracting large shares of R&D investments and an innovative service sector.
b) The challenge is to bring together a wide-ranging partnership of stakeholders in Europe and China to create an innovation platform for developing and piloting innovative solutions in sustainable urbanisation that rely on advanced knowledge and technologies, taking into account and adding value to the manifold on-going activities on various aspects of urbanisation. The platform should build on the activities carried out on an intergovernmental level (JPI Urban Europe) and via the EU-funded projects in support of joint funding initiatives (ERA-Net Smart Urban Futures, ERA-Net Smart Cities and Communities) and seek to use events and networks created by projects in support of the policy dialogue.
Scope:
a) Cultural and socio-economic aspects of urban issues in China (Research and Innovation Action)
(2017) The development of cities in China is taking place at impressive pace and has affected millions of citizens. Many aspects of city planning and development, such as infrastructures, regulatory regimes, taxation, health, education and culture, have therefore a bearing on the framework conditions within which innovation occurs and which shape living conditions of residents. Joint European-Chinese research taking into consideration these essential elements of city development could contribute to an improved reciprocal knowledge on urbanisation processes between the EU and China. Through the joint format, research will benefit from access to data and expertise from both EU and China, with a view to proposing new models of sustainable urban development adapted to local socio-economic, cultural and political specificities. [1]
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU in the order of EUR 2.5 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. This does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
b) EU-China innovation platform on sustainable urbanisation (Coordination and Support Action) [2]
(2016) Proposals shall establish a platform bringing together policy makers, national authorities, industry, academia and other stakeholders in EU and China in sectors important for sustainable urbanisation. The platform should develop joint strategies, be the 'nursery' of joint projects and a broker of science-industry partnerships between Europe and China. It should mobilise key urbanisation related initiatives such as the European Innovation Partnership on Smart Cities and Communities and the Joint Programming Initiative on Urban Europe. Proposals shall develop, as core element, a joint EU-China strategic R&I agenda on sustainable urbanisation, in consultation with relevant stakeholders (national, regional and municipal public authorities, industry, academia, financiers, city networks etc.). The agenda should contain collaborative research projects and large scale demonstration projects, including joint activities that may be financed partly through coordinated EU-China Calls for proposals. It should allow for seamless integration with initiatives financed by EU Member States and Associated Countries, regional governments in China, or by industry. Framework conditions for cooperative innovation should be addressed as necessary. Finally, the platform should promote linkages between sustainable urbanisation demonstration projects in European and Chinese cities, including by running a competition that will lead to the selection of a small number of demonstration sites in China and in Europe, including also suggesting the network infrastructures (energy, transport, ICT, water, waste management, compact urban development, municipal finances etc.) that would need to be put in place in these sites and possible financing means, as well as designing demonstration projects with conditions that encourage co-investment by Chinese and EU partners in intelligent solutions for sustainable urbanisation, building as much as possible on existing initiatives.
As such, the platform is expected to contribute to creating the conditions for large scale science-industry cooperation on sustainable urbanisation that can address the challenges China and Europe face in this area. The platform should be open for participation by all stakeholders that can make a contribution to its objectives. On the European side, this should result in broad involvement across Member States and Associated Countries.
A maximum of one proposal will be supported. The Commission considers that a proposal requesting an EU contribution of EUR 1.5 million for a duration of 3 years would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. This does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Due to the specific challenge of this topic, in addition to the minimum number of participants as set out in the Rules of Participation, proposals shall include at least one participant from China. Under this topic, legal entities established in China are eligible for funding from the Union.
Expected Impact:
This topic is expected to provide in-depth insights on EU-China cultural and socio-economic aspects on urbanisation highlighting the common challenges and possible solutions that may apply in both EU and China. Specific impacts are expected in the field of city planning, policy making, regulatory regime, governance and public services. Negative externalities (e.g. environment and public health) should be particularly addressed and exchange of best practices for citizen's well-being should be encouraged. The Coordination action is expected to increase stakeholder awareness, exchanges and synergies between Chinese and European industrial, academic and public players engaged in sustainable urbanisation research, innovation and application. Improved complementarity and coordination between different sustainable urbanisation funding programmes supported by the EU, the EU Member States and China should be achieved. The CSA should ensure a better match between the supply of innovative technological solutions and the needs of city planners and managers in charge of organising services linked to sustainable urbanisation. It is also expected to increase the capacity of industrial actors to develop and provide more effective solutions for the needs of sustainable urbanisation, and of city planners and managers to make informed choices on innovative technologies.

To create a network of centres in the world's most dynamic and innovative countries and regions that will connect and support European researchers and entrepreneurs globally, in order to strengthen the position of Europe as a world leader in science, technology and innovation.
Scope:
To establish new centres, or networks of centres, building where possible on existing European science, technology and innovation structures located in international partner countries and regions in order to ensure economies of scale while avoiding unnecessary duplication. These centres/networks will engage in activities such as:
Networking services including partnering events, workshops, boot camps, venture capital pitching events, best practice exchange, visits and tours etc.;
Advice and support to European academic as well as industrial/private sector actors on how to internationalise by engaging in research and innovation in the international partner country/region; this may be based on studies, analysis and monitoring work, including on local conditions in the country/region, e.g. on local innovation and market framework conditions, on links between business needs, the labour market and training/education etc.;
Advocacy towards international partner countries/regions in favour of open and responsible research and innovation;
Providing work space, infrastructure and secondment opportunities to private and public European organisations that want to be represented in the partner country in an economic way while enjoying the synergies of co-location with other representatives of European organisations;
Design and piloting of public/private funding mechanisms aiming at increasing alternative methods of finance of the Centres/Networks based on a demand driven set of services;
Promotion, awareness raising and training activities, e.g. on European science, technology and innovation strengths and actors, on cooperation opportunities, on the international dimension of Horizon 2020, on opportunities offered by national programmes etc.
Proposed work shall seek to establish the centres/networks and ensure their initial operational phase. Establishment shall take place in accordance with a business model that shall aim to finance, in the medium term (at the latest by the end of the grant), part of the activities of the centre/network through service contracts with private and public clients. The services offered should be open on equal terms to all EU Member States and Associated Countries and their organisations.
Each proposal shall target one country and region that is an established or emerging science, technology or innovation leader; proposals addressing all or part of Brazil, China and the USA are strongly encouraged without excluding other countries with similar characteristics.
Consortia shall ensure adequate involvement of European stakeholders from existing structures or representations in the addressed partner countries/regions. Proposals should build on previous work of bilateral and regional international cooperation projects where appropriate.
A maximum of one proposal will be supported per international partner country or region. The Commission considers that proposals requesting an EU contribution of around EUR 3 million for a duration of 3-4 years would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Under this topic, legal entities established in the target country/region are eligible for funding from the Union.
Expected Impact:
Reinforced cooperation between European research and innovation organisations and researchers and those of the Union's international partners;
Higher visibility and prestige for European research and innovation and its actors in international partner countries/regions;
Stronger presence of European organisations in the science and innovation environment of the partner country/region;

Specific challenge:
Space systems produce information which often cannot be acquired in any other way. Specifically, the Copernicus data, including the Contributing Missions (current and future), are expected to provide improved data quality, coverage and revisit times, and increase the value of Earth Observation data for scientific work and future emerging applications. Equally, space data obtained for specific purposes can subsequently reveal novel scientific insights which were not specifically intended or expected at the time of space sensor launch. Explorer missions, e.g. at ESA, generate new remote sensing opportunities. In order to fuel this cycle of discovery, and further enhance scientific, operational and commercial exploitation of collected space data related to Earth (now or in the near future), new upstream data products and analysis methods suitable for subsequent integration into applications (such as for instance conducted in the calls of the Horizon 2020 societal challenges, or service product lines) should be generated. In this context space data (i.e. remotely-sensed data as well as in-space located measurements, gravity data, magnetic data, GNSS signals) could be relevant to a wide variety of Earth-related topics (relevant to earth environment, atmosphere, agriculture, land use, risk, emergency management, security, cultural heritage and archaeology etc.), thereby widening the data scope beyond conventional EO images.
Scope:
New and hitherto immature uses of Earth-relevant space-based data (also taking into account specific satellite sensor acquisition modes) should be investigated to enable integration or assimilation into scientific investigations related to Earth system sciences, or forecasting models at regional or wider geographical extent. Attention should be given to space based data covering geographic areas sensitively affecting the earth system, as is the case for instance for the Arctic and Antarctic regions. When considering inclusion of space based data, consideration should also be given to the near real-time access opportunities offered by state of the art and next generation space/satellite communications capabilities.
It is expected that proposals address also how the insights proposed to be obtained from space based data can be validated, e.g. in combination with ground based observations, or in-flight collected data, with appropriate attention also being given to calibration of space data. Research into specification of the uncertainties associated with the derived results should also be included. To enhance the use of intermediate and final products, due attention is also to be given to standardisation of data, best practices, dissemination mechanisms and reference frames. Furthermore, to enable integration into operational services such as Copernicus requires highly automated processes with minimum manual intervention to be developed.
Preference shall be given to the usage of data from space-borne European instruments. In case such European data exists, the primary use of non-European data shall be justified by the applicant. Proposers may thus find it helpful to consult information on availability of Copernicus Sentinel Data, access to Copernicus Contributing Mission data, at the Commission’s web http://ec.europa.eu/enterprise/policies/space/research
The Commission considers that projects requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 2 and 3 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected impact:
Proposals are expected to prepare the ground for further innovative exploitation of European space data in scientific activities and/or future and emerging applications.
Proposals are expected to have a significant impact in stimulating wide and further exploitation of the used data, be it in scientific or commercial use, or operational services. The application potential of these new data products and concepts will have to be demonstrated through selected examples and demonstration cases. The results shall be actively disseminated in the relevant scientific publications, as well as towards potential user communities as appropriate. For operational exploitation, the needs of the user community are expected to have been validated in order to ensure a positive impact. The research may deliver as well input for drawing up user requirements for enhanced processing tools or future observation instruments.
An important impact is also the applicability of the results for further systematic research usage, either in the context of the societal challenges addressed by Horizon 2020 calls, or research conducted in domains not covered in the scope of other Horizon 2020 funding areas.

","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
The Asia-Pacific is a large and diverse region, encompassing industrialised countries, emerging economies and developing countries. Perhaps due to this diversity, and save a few specific cases, the European Union has lacked a strategic approach towards the region, despite strong economic interests and heightened security concerns in the area. Several EU Member States have adopted an active bilateral approach towards key partners, but the European Union has mostly failed to speak with one voice in relevant fora. Nowadays the multiple and complex challenges shared by the two regions, ranging from climate change and sustainable development to conventional and non-conventional security challenges, are opening up new opportunities for the EU to become more involved in the region beyond economic cooperation although differences remain in areas like human rights or democratic governance. In order to re-think its role and strategy for the Asia-Pacific, and to fully tap the potential for action at European level, the European Union needs to be supported by sound research showing the concrete implications of further engaging with and in the region in a number of sectorial and geographic areas.
Scope:
The research to address this challenge should in particular focus on the following key dimensions. It is expected to either comprehensively address one of these dimensions or to combine them. The research may also cover other issues relevant for addressing the specific challenge.
1) Regional integration in South-East Asia and its consequences for Europe
South-East Asia has seen, since 1967, the most ambitious project of regional integration outside of Europe, pursued through the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). It has followed a different integration path to Europe, based on dialogue and non-interference rather than convergence and law. The region has an immense social, cultural and economic potential, but it still faces the challenge of developing a regional identity with both an internal dimension (how to nourish a sense of belonging) and an external dimension (how to engage with foreign powers, such as China, India, the United States, Japan and the EU). The process of nation-building in the ten ASEAN countries and other non-ASEAN countries is incomplete or nascent. It is also confronted with widespread poverty, disruptive migration flows, inter-ethnic conflicts and even territorial disputes. For the EU to engage effectively in South-East Asia and manage the variety of countries and cultures present in the region, it is necessary to understand what ‘region’ means to the peoples of these countries within and beyond the ASEAN context. Research is thus necessary on the mobility of people, knowledge, ideologies, cultures, goods and capital within the region and their influence on the emergence of a South-East Asian identity which would help the EU and its Member States to forge coherent, adapted and culturally relevant foreign policies with all countries in the region.
To that effect, research should also underpin the implementation of the Joint Communication on EU-ASEAN relations in the different sectors and in particular in the field of sectorial cooperation.[1]
2) Governance in and of the Pacific as a challenge for Europe
One of the major strategic challenges in the Asia-Pacific region relates to the governance of the Pacific itself (including Overseas Countries and Territories). The Pacific Islands region represents a unique diversity of nation-state formations and regional and intergovernmental mechanisms, which is experiencing major challenges regarding the protection of its exceptional natural environment, threatened in particular by climate change. The small islands developing states (SIDS) of the Pacific therefore have a central role in the contestation over, competition for, and conservation of some of the world’s key resources, far surpassing their modest size in terms of land mass and population. As the second largest donor of development assistance to the region, the EU’s interests and activities in the Pacific are highly significant and hold important potential for the future. However, the region’s new geopolitical currency is a willingness to seriously engage with emerging definitions of an equal, two-way partnership relation in Pacific terms that expands beyond the monetary dimension of cooperation. The EU is thus at a cross-road in its engagement with the Pacific. Research should examine the emerging governance structures in the region, in terms of sovereignty, state-making, policy autonomy and aid dependency, by paying close attention to issues such as trade and transport, fisheries management, climate change, biodiversity, social inclusion, democracy, blue/green growth and and political CFSP aspects. Research should also comparatively analyse the role and impact of external actors in the region, prominently focussing on the European Union and its Member States but also take account of the influence of, and the interplay with global (China, USA) and regional (Australia, New Zealand) powers in the region. Building on existing research, lessons should be drawn from the Pacific experience for devising new approaches, as well as on how Europe can effectively respond to the strategic challenge posed by the Pacific.
The participation of partners from third countries and regions in the targeted geographic areas in proposals submitted to this topic is strongly encouraged.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU in the order of EUR 2.5 million for each dimension would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. This does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
Research under this topic is expected to provide a comprehensive overview of the strategic challenges that Europe faces in the various zones of the Asia-Pacific region, and on a range of relevant subjects. Based on this, it will inform different foreign policy actors, processes and initiatives at EU and Member State-level either with a sectorial or geographic focus, especially by providing essential insights on the legal, cultural and socio-economic aspects surrounding their implementation.

","Coordination and support action
","08 December 2015
","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
The importance of innovation and socio-economic aspects in sustainable urbanisation has been recognised by the EU and China in their Joint Declaration on the EU-China Partnership on Urbanisation signed in 2012, as well as in the conclusions of the EU-China Innovation Cooperation Dialogue of 2013. This topic therefore covers two specific challenges:
a) In China and elsewhere, the management of an exceptionally rapid urban growth poses considerable challenges to policy-makers and city planners. In such a delicate context, physical city planning cannot be considered in isolation from governance aspects, related for instance to land use and resources for city financing but also to the environmental human and cultural dimensions of cities. Urban infrastructures and public services also call for a balanced and integrated planning so as to minimise or avoid the negative socio-economic, human and environmental impacts on city-dwellers, migrants, and seniors. Cities are also viewed as engines of growth and innovation, often attracting large shares of R&D investments and an innovative service sector.
b) The challenge is to bring together a wide-ranging partnership of stakeholders in Europe and China to create an innovation platform for developing and piloting innovative solutions in sustainable urbanisation that rely on advanced knowledge and technologies, taking into account and adding value to the manifold on-going activities on various aspects of urbanisation. The platform should build on the activities carried out on an intergovernmental level (JPI Urban Europe) and via the EU-funded projects in support of joint funding initiatives (ERA-Net Smart Urban Futures, ERA-Net Smart Cities and Communities) and seek to use events and networks created by projects in support of the policy dialogue.
Scope:
a) Cultural and socio-economic aspects of urban issues in China (Research and Innovation Action)
(2017) The development of cities in China is taking place at impressive pace and has affected millions of citizens. Many aspects of city planning and development, such as infrastructures, regulatory regimes, taxation, health, education and culture, have therefore a bearing on the framework conditions within which innovation occurs and which shape living conditions of residents. Joint European-Chinese research taking into consideration these essential elements of city development could contribute to an improved reciprocal knowledge on urbanisation processes between the EU and China. Through the joint format, research will benefit from access to data and expertise from both EU and China, with a view to proposing new models of sustainable urban development adapted to local socio-economic, cultural and political specificities. [1]
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU in the order of EUR 2.5 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. This does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
b) EU-China innovation platform on sustainable urbanisation (Coordination and Support Action) [2]
(2016) Proposals shall establish a platform bringing together policy makers, national authorities, industry, academia and other stakeholders in EU and China in sectors important for sustainable urbanisation. The platform should develop joint strategies, be the 'nursery' of joint projects and a broker of science-industry partnerships between Europe and China. It should mobilise key urbanisation related initiatives such as the European Innovation Partnership on Smart Cities and Communities and the Joint Programming Initiative on Urban Europe. Proposals shall develop, as core element, a joint EU-China strategic R&I agenda on sustainable urbanisation, in consultation with relevant stakeholders (national, regional and municipal public authorities, industry, academia, financiers, city networks etc.). The agenda should contain collaborative research projects and large scale demonstration projects, including joint activities that may be financed partly through coordinated EU-China Calls for proposals. It should allow for seamless integration with initiatives financed by EU Member States and Associated Countries, regional governments in China, or by industry. Framework conditions for cooperative innovation should be addressed as necessary. Finally, the platform should promote linkages between sustainable urbanisation demonstration projects in European and Chinese cities, including by running a competition that will lead to the selection of a small number of demonstration sites in China and in Europe, including also suggesting the network infrastructures (energy, transport, ICT, water, waste management, compact urban development, municipal finances etc.) that would need to be put in place in these sites and possible financing means, as well as designing demonstration projects with conditions that encourage co-investment by Chinese and EU partners in intelligent solutions for sustainable urbanisation, building as much as possible on existing initiatives.
As such, the platform is expected to contribute to creating the conditions for large scale science-industry cooperation on sustainable urbanisation that can address the challenges China and Europe face in this area. The platform should be open for participation by all stakeholders that can make a contribution to its objectives. On the European side, this should result in broad involvement across Member States and Associated Countries.
A maximum of one proposal will be supported. The Commission considers that a proposal requesting an EU contribution of EUR 1.5 million for a duration of 3 years would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. This does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Due to the specific challenge of this topic, in addition to the minimum number of participants as set out in the Rules of Participation, proposals shall include at least one participant from China. Under this topic, legal entities established in China are eligible for funding from the Union.
Expected Impact:
This topic is expected to provide in-depth insights on EU-China cultural and socio-economic aspects on urbanisation highlighting the common challenges and possible solutions that may apply in both EU and China. Specific impacts are expected in the field of city planning, policy making, regulatory regime, governance and public services. Negative externalities (e.g. environment and public health) should be particularly addressed and exchange of best practices for citizen's well-being should be encouraged. The Coordination action is expected to increase stakeholder awareness, exchanges and synergies between Chinese and European industrial, academic and public players engaged in sustainable urbanisation research, innovation and application. Improved complementarity and coordination between different sustainable urbanisation funding programmes supported by the EU, the EU Member States and China should be achieved. The CSA should ensure a better match between the supply of innovative technological solutions and the needs of city planners and managers in charge of organising services linked to sustainable urbanisation. It is also expected to increase the capacity of industrial actors to develop and provide more effective solutions for the needs of sustainable urbanisation, and of city planners and managers to make informed choices on innovative technologies.

Deadline date","Scope:
Specific challenge: Public sector innovation and the modernisation of public administrations are considered as important underlying factors for economic growth[1] and also contribute to competitiveness. It is essential to promote innovation in order to foster efficient, open citizen-centric public services. This innovation also addresses the challenge of social change and user needs.
In order to improve efficiency, effectiveness and quality of public services, the public sector needs to implement new processes, products, services and methods of delivery. The public sector typically combines and builds on top of existing technology elements to innovate. However, in today's financial situation, the economical power of public administrations to pull research results into the market cannot be ignored. In the EU, the overall market for purchases of goods, services and works by the public sector accounts for almost 20% of GDP.
New insights in how to think of the systems and services combined with new technologies are providing exciting opportunities for innovative designs and transformation of public sector delivery.
 Further research, starting with identifying the specific challenges of the public sector, such as policy domain requeriments and the needs of targeted citizens or businesses is needed. The introduction of new technologies could lead to the transformation of processes and better regulation. Projects should demonstrate the benefit both for society as well as for civil servants. Research shall also explore the burdens - whether legal, human or others - that prevent public administrations from implementing the identified emerging technologies.
This requires multidisciplinary research taking into account the societal, political as well as human factors, including citizens and civil servants, and how they can contribute to modernising policies and innovative services of general interest in any policy field. Where relevant involving users and citizens in the design of public services is critical and it is also important to explore social acceptability, impact on the improvement in public service delivery and potential benefits for citizens, businesses and society.
Such an approach enables research results to reach a potential market, while at the same time it will help in modernising the public sector. It will take account of , and further develop, new knowledge on the interaction between citizens and public authorities, while taking into consideration the intoduction of new technologies in the particular context of public administrations, and explore how the uptake of emerging technologies by the public sector can help Europe overcome the crisis. For example, how can Web 3.0 (semantic web technologies), semantic interoperability, linked open data, Internet of things, social sensor networks, radio-frequency identification or wearable technologies, help to tackle challenges in the public sector? How can emerging, new technologies facilitate the process of government to become a platform allowing public and private actors to collaborate and create new services using open data and open services? How do emerging new technologies need to be adjusted to the specifities of the different selected policy domains of public activity?
Scope:
a) Research and innovation actions
Based on the development and use of emerging technologies and research carried out so far, activities will support the preparation of next phases and possible validation in near to operational environment for the implementation of emerging ICT technologies in the public sector.
The focus can be on any or several of the below:
-                 Improving effectiveness and efficiency of public administrations;
-                 Transforming public administrations processes;
-                 Processes and ways in which new cultural and societal challenges are identified in public policies;
-                 Understanding the political and cultural attitudes and factors affecting attitudes among both civil servants and citizens towards public sector transformation and supporting adaptation;
-                 Transforming delivery of public services to business and citizens taking account of diversity (gender, age, disability etc);
-                 Uptake and acceptability of the use of emerging technologies in the public sector;
-                 Reducing the administrative burden of citizens and businesses;
-                 Offering inclusive public services.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 2 and 5 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
b) Coordination and support actions[2]:
The activities should aim at encouraging networking of relevant stakeholders and teams working in these areas and to support constituency building. The dynamic, multidisciplinary network will include researchers within the social and economic sciences working alongside computer scientists, designers and innovators. Following an assessment of the needs that may include engaging citizens and user centred design, the network will carry out a gap analysis and identify emerging technologies and potential applications for their implementation in the public sector, having in mind specificities relevant to different policy domains of public activity. The activities will conclude with the outlining of a roadmap for emerging research directions, in a multidisciplinary approach, taking into consideration activities also undertaken outside the European Union.
Expected impact: This topic will explore the potential benefit of using emerging ICT technologies in support of public sector innovation in line with the objectives of the eGovernment Action Plan 2011-2015 and identify barriers for a wider use. Integrating emerging ICT technologies to enable an efficient, effective, environmentally-friendly, open and citizen-centric public sector will help to prepare the transformation to the public sector of the future and to support the implementation of innovative policy reforms adopted in different policy fields. The take-up of those technologies will encourage new innovations for the benefit of businesses and citizens, and open new areas for socio-economic research. Furthermore, stimulating the creation and use by the public services of emerging technologies will help to accelerate time-to-market and open up new markets for ICT solutions across the EU.

Specific challenge:
Rapid developments in technologies and communication in various fields go hand in hand with new opportunities for forensic science to investigate more and a greater variety of traces, to extract more information from less material, quicker than ever before. In order to to keep the standards of forensic science in Europe at a high level regarding juridical and technological questions. Meanwhile, organised crime and criminals do not limit themselves to regional or national borders. Their crimes are thus leaving traces in multiple countries. Cross border access to evidence has become an absolute necessity for Law Enforcement Agencies (LEA) and judicial authorities.
Evidence gathering, collection and exchange at EU level should be usable from the field to the judge, independently of the technology used to commit the crimes and of where the crimes have taken place. Rapid developments in technologies and communications in various fields go hand in hand with new opportunities for forensic science.
Proposals for this topic should take into account the existing EU and national projects in this field, such as the Council Conclusions on the vision for European Forensic Science 2020 which foresee the creation of a European Forensic Science Area and the development of forensic science infrastructure in Europe.""
Scope:
Proposals for this topic should focus on the development methodologies of tools and EU-wide standards for the secure storage, smart visualisation, access and the rapid exchange of forensic data supporting evidence.
A multianalytical platform integrating different techniques should be proposed in order to achieve better strategies for gathering and analyzing evidence in the field of forensic research. Relying on knowledge-based fields such as artificial intelligence, machine learning, different procedures, tools and algorithm should be developed within this platform, based on the standard outlined above.
Specific areas of research could be:
Development of an analysis platform that could be deployed at the scene of the crime and which can be validated against the currently used forensic guidelines and standards.
The establishment of a EU-wide databases on, for instance, new synthetic drugs and drug precursors,The creation of tools for tracking virtual currencies implicated in criminal transactions.
Other types of pan-Eu databases on recognition.
In addition due to the variability and the wide range of crime types, procedures or methodologies should be developed or adapted to the specific crime features. Moreover, horizontal strategies could be proposed for profiling crimes or offenders and matching and predicting different type of crimes. This should lead to the establishment of a catalogue of these procedures or methodologies.
The development of a base line system for current and future end users should also be envisaged and the solution should follow Open Source concepts.
Where necessary new technologies should be developed for sampling, analysing, evaluating, interpreting and recording forensic evidence, with a view to achieve solid and court-proof forensic evidence that can be used during legal prosecution.
The use of the most advanced information technologies should allow improving and upgrading the current forensic systems in the European police institutions. The scope of the proposed tool should involve law enforcement bodies from the design phase to the prototyping and test phase.
Proposals adressing this topic may involve the use of classified background information (EU or national) or the production of security sensitive results. As such, certain project deliverables may require security classification. The final decision on the classification of projects is subject to the security evaluation.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between €9m and €12m would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected impact:
Projects under this topic should lead to the development of novel easy to use in-situ forensic tools, customised to the specific needs of EU LEA. Better profiling of crimes and offenders. Quicker matching of different types of crime. Shorter court cases due to the availability of more solid court proof forensic evidence.
For industry better understanding of modern operational LEA requirements, thus increasing their competitiveness.
Considerable improvement in the field of public security and improved trust of the citizen in the work of police forces in the EU.
The outcome of the proposal is expected to lead to development up to Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 8; please see part G of the General Annexes.

Specific Challenge:
European large urban environments are subject to various challenges and threats to urban security linked to their big size and large population.  These challenges have also a strong impact on the security perception of the citizens and, by this, they can impact on the economic development and the quality of life.
Consequently, there is a growing need to go beyond the idea that only the law enforcement and criminal justice systems are tasked to tackle urban security challenges. On the contrary, new approaches and innovative solutions, including sustainable, affordable and transferrable security technologies, are needed to solicit citizens' engagement to prevent, mitigate and recover from the above-mentioned security challenges and to foster their direct participation in the improvement of the urban security conditions.
In this framework, and upon due consideration for the concerned ethical issues, recent technological advances and appropriate sensing mechanisms can help to make a city more transparent and readable as well as to empower the citizens in smart cities by ensuring that the main urban dynamics are unveiled and available to the public.
To this end, a bottom-up approach is sought to ensure that the above-mentioned approaches and solutions are satisfactorily responding to the needs of the end-users and of the citizens' community at large. There is a need for an interdisciplinary approach involving contributions from technological research and socio-economic disciplines, particularly architecture, anthropology, arts, economy, law, linguistics and sociology.
Scope:
The proposed research should focus on the development of innovative solutions and technologies for urban security and resilience that, at the same time, intend to reduce the fear of crime and enhance the perception of security of the inhabitants of large urban environments.
Specific attention should be paid to technologically enhanced platforms that allow citizens both to share information and experiences in real-time streaming and to receive alerts and messages from security command and control centres.
The proposed action should take into account sustainable and low impact solutions and, possibly, rely on already set standards and tools. Modularity security and privacy by design should also be in the backbone.
The proposed research should take into consideration past and on-going EU research in this field. The testing and validation of the results from the proposed research should be carried out in several European cities. Strong synergies may be expected in the fields of 3D mapping, accurate positioning and timing services, GIS analysis functions and environment modelling, simulation and visualisation technologies.
Finally, the consideration for a possible wider integration of new and existing digital technologies into sustainable and innovative security solutions is strongly welcome.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between €3m and €5m would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected impact:
-          Reduce the fear of crime and enhance the perception of security of the inhabitants of large urban environments.
-          Better addressing security challenges in large urban environments.
-          Increase the perception of security of citizens by empowering them, fostering their sense of belonging to a greater community.
-          Facilitating the engagement of citizens to improve the security conditions of smart cities.
-          Providing new market opportunities, especially for SMEs and entrepreneurs, to develop and produce innovative technologies for urban security.
 The action is expected to proactively target the needs and requirements of users, such as citizens and local police forces.

Specific challenge:
The Internet is nowadays at the core of any business activity. All large and distributed organisations rely on the Internet for the exchange of data, information, and knowledge, both internally and externally, so as to organise and run their activities. Organized crime is no exception. The Internet has become an important tool for criminal organisations to carry out illegal activities. Research under this topic should refer to Internet Forensics as the set of investigation techniques concerned with Internet as a media used by organised crime in general - mainly to communicate and exchange data and information. A further and specific challenge is represented by the camouflage of the real nature of the concerned data and information. Due to the borderless nature of the Internet, specific trans-border aspects should be considered when dealing with Internet Forensics. Therefore, aside from the relevant technological aspects, legal and organisational issues like the co-ordination of different Law Enforcement Authorities (LEA) and the harmonisation of the different legal frameworks have to be addressed.
Scope:
Proposals should focus on how to extract, compare, correlate, filter, reason over and/or interpret suspect information, data, communications stored and/or transferred on the Internet including on the deepweb, darknet and other less easily accessible parts of networks, obtained under a lawful warrant, in order to discover facts and evidence to support forensic investigations (including e.g. resolving identities in social networks, authorship identification on webfora, shared media, etc.). Software and, if necessary, hardware tools, methods and guidelines should be proposed. They should tackle all the layers of analysis, from the data-packet level to the data mining, to language interpretation, semantic analysis, and information retrieval, including the multi-lingual aspects, and video and picture analysis. Investigative techniques on any kind of crime using the Internet to some extent (to communicate, transfer data, etc.) should be concerned. The proposed solutions should enable accelerated searches of the huge amount of data-transfer that occurs on the Internet, and to discover and make clear (interpret) out of it the relevant data and information. At the same time, limited, or at least controlled, pervasiveness of the proposed solutions must be guaranteed, in order guarantee the privacy of all the internet users. Ethical issues have to be clearly addressed. Appropriate solutions to fulfil the legitimate request of privacy by the citizens should be embedded in the very core of the proposed solutions. Also, all the developed tools, methods and guidelines should be supported by training support and curricula.
Where necessary new technologies should be developed for sampling, analysing, evaluating, interpreting and recording forensic evidence with a view to achieve solid and court-proof forensic evidence that can be used during legal prosecution.
The development of a base line system for current and future end users should also be envisaged and the solution should follow Open Source concepts.
Proposals will have to deal with the management of personal data, and related ethical and legal issues. Therefore considerable attention will have to be given to privacy and data protection, and to the adherence to European regulations. For each proposed solution, potential issues vis-à-vis these rights and regulations will have to be analysed, and recommendations on the best solutions to these issues must be proposed.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between  €3m and €5m would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected impact:
- improved LEA capabilities to conduct investigations by using information travelling and stored on the Internet obtained under a lawful warrant ;
- improved training of LEA staff able to perform these investigations. increased crime prosecution capabilities;
- shorter court cases due to the availability of more solid court proof forensic evidence;
- increased privacy and data protection during forensic investigations;
- for industry better understanding of modern operational LEA requirements, thus increasing their competitiveness.
The outcome of the proposal is expected to lead to development from Technology Readiness Levels (TRL) 6 or above; please see part G of the General Annexes.

Specific Challenge:
New means and technologies of communication the growing interactive usage of the internet, the rise of social media and the internet of things lead to a change in handling identity related data for law enforcement agencies and border management. These circumstances and the general digitalisation of society result in a significant qualitative and quantitative revaluation of the subject identity. As  identity trust and security are central drivers for economic and societal development a framework for a reliable e-identity ecosystem needs to be set up. Such an e-ID ecosystem would safeguard the fundamental parameters of identity management: security – efficiency – user friendliness – trust – privacy and data protection. Enhanced public security and better (digital) privacy protection will become part of the same consistent European identity strategy.     
Identity Management will play a pivotal role in this system.
Identity Management starts with proper breeder documents, other identity documents including their lifecycle and goes to identification and verification for physical and virtual access as well as virtual identities in secure applications and social networks. In all these areas of identification, security is severely endangered, if identity fraud has taken place. It is very well known, that cases of identity fraud and wrong identity are heavily involved in people trafficking and organized crime. Additionally, identity fraud in virtual places leads to theft, misuse of information and cyber-mobbing. Therefore, new processes, technologies and security features needs to be developed to increase or hold the high level of quality of security documents and corresponding processes..
Scope:
Technological, organizational and societal means necessary for a European electronic identity ecosystem will be identified, researched and tested:
New security features with corresponding quality control and checking technologies
Enhanced document lifecycle processes
Harmonized document processes and security features
Technologies for linking physical and virtual identity
Combination of biometric technologies and administrative processes for identification management
Identification of the necessary legal and societal steps to safeguard trust and data protection
Identify patterns in identity fraud and highlight associated social networksn
Take into account and build upon results and findings of existing research projects that potentially may contribute to an European electronic identity ecosystem
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between €1m and €2m would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected impact:
A European e-identity ecosystem (potentially tested on a national test-bed level) would create a decisive competitive advantage for Europe on the global level. New technologies and processes in identity management will ease the work of border management and law enforcement authorities as the identity verification becomes more reliable. The personal security increases dues to reduced risk of identity fraud and cyber mobbing. Finally, improved id documents will make people trafficking and organized crime more difficult. A European e-identity ecosystem should make use of existing research results in this field to the highest possible extent to optimise funding impact.
The outcome of the proposal is expected to lead to development up to Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 4; please see part G of the General Annexes.

The challenge is to make Europe the best place in the world for collaborative research and innovation on future and emerging technologies that will renew the basis for future European competitiveness and growth, and that will make a difference for society in the decades to come.
Scope:
Proposals should address one of the following topics:
FET Futures [2017] [1]: identifying strategy options, challenges and opportunities to stimulate and organise interdisciplinary research and innovation towards new and visionary technologies of any kind. Actions should rely on evidence from FET activities (e.g., portfolio, constituency, results) and from other sources (including other funding bodies or private initiatives worldwide, like those using prize schemes or challenges). They should aim at open and dynamic stakeholder participation using creative methods and on-line tools/social networks. This topic should include public engagement processes as discussed in the introduction of this FET Work Programme.
FET Exchange [2017]: actions for structuring and strengthening an emerging FET-relevant science and technology research and innovation topic and the interdisciplinary communities involved in this topic. This may include, for example, research roadmapping, stimulating (formal and informal) learning and exchange, expanding the range of disciplines (including the life sciences and humanities where relevant), involving new actors such as young researchers, entrepreneurs and high-tech SMEs, and broadening stakeholder engagement (multi-actor or citizen).
For scope item a) at most one action will be funded.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 0.3 and 0.5 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
Strengthening globally recognised European leadership in the early exploration of visionary, new and emerging technologies, beyond academic excellence and with a strong engagement of scientists, citizens, innovators and policy makers.
Improved long-term innovation potential in Europe both from the abundance of novel ideas and the range of actors ready to take them forward.
Improved understanding of the range of possible impact mechanisms for long-term science and technology research.
Improved readiness across Europe to engage in silo-breaking research collaboration and to take up new research and innovation practices.

FET projects often generate new and sometimes unexpected opportunities for commercial or societal application. This topic aims at funding further innovation related work (i.e. activities which were not scheduled to be funded by the original project) to verify and substantiate the innovation potential of ideas arising from FET funded projects and to support the next steps in turning them into a genuine social or economic innovation.
Scope:
Short and focused individual or collaborative actions to take out of the lab a promising result or proof-of-concept that originated from a FET-funded project and to get it on the way to social or economic innovation through new entrepreneurship or otherwise. The action will support the transformation of that specific research result into a credible offering for economic or social impact, by exploring the feasibility of an exploitation path and by coordinating and supporting the assembling of the right knowledge, skills and resources and thus serves as a launch pad for exploitation.
This call topic is focused on the early innovation stages from results of an ongoing or recently finished project[1] funded through FET under FP7 or H2020. The complementarity and precise link with the relevant FET project is to be explicitly addressed in the proposal by clearly stating the nature and origin of the results to be taken up, and by adding a confirmation of any necessary agreements with owners or right holders of those results to move towards their exploitation. This call topic does not fund additional research, nor does it fund activities that are/were already foreseen in the relevant FET project. Activities to be funded should be fit-for-purpose (e.g., tailored to the level of maturity of the result to be taken up) and can include, among others, the definition of a commercialisation process to be followed, market and competitiveness analysis, technology assessment, consolidation of intellectual property rights and strategy, scenario and business case development, developing contacts and support relevant activities with for instance, industrial transfer partners, potential licence-takers, investors, societal organisations or potential end users.
By focusing on the very early stage of the innovation path, the scope of this call includes situations where an SME or other suitable entrepreneurial context may not yet exist.
The Commission considers that proposals for actions no longer than 18 months and requesting a contribution from the EU of up to EUR 0.1 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals of different duration.
Expected Impact:
Increased innovation potential from FET projects by picking up expected as well as non-anticipated innovation opportunities.
Creation of concrete and closer-to-market high-potential innovations from FET projects.
Stimulating, supporting and rewarding an open and proactive mind-set towards exploitation beyond the research world in Europe.
Seeding future growth and the creation of jobs from FET research.

","31 March 2015","Scope:
Specific challenge: Supporting a large set of early stage, high risk visionary science and technology collaborative research projects is necessary for the successful exploration of new foundations for radically new future technologies. Nurturing fragile ideas requires an agile, risk-friendly and highly interdisciplinary research approach, expanding well beyond the strictly technological disciplines. Recognising and stimulating the driving role of new high-potential actors in research and innovation, such as women, young researchers and high-tech SMEs, is also important for nurturing the scientific and industrial leaders of the future.
Scope: Proposals are sought for collaborative research with all of the following characteristics:
•                Long-term vision: the research proposed must address a new, original or radical long-term vision of technology-enabled possibilities that are far beyond the state of the art and currently not anticipated by technology roadmaps.
•                Breakthrough S&T target: research must target scientifically ambitious and technologically concrete breakthroughs that are arguably crucial steps towards achieving the long-term vision and that are plausibly attainable within the life-time of the proposed project.
•                Foundational: the breakthroughs that are envisaged must be foundational in the sense that they can establish a basis for a new line of technology not currently anticipated.
•                Novelty: the research proposed must find its plausibility in new ideas and concepts, rather than in the application or incremental refinement of existing ones.
•                High-risk: the potential of a new technological direction depends on a whole range of factors that cannot be apprehended from a single disciplinary viewpoint. This inherent high-risk has to be countered by a strongly interdisciplinary research approach, where needed expanding well beyond the strictly technological realm.
•                Interdisciplinary: the proposed collaborations must be interdisciplinary in the sense that they go beyond current mainstream collaboration configurations in joint science- and technology research, and that they aim to advance different scientific and technological disciplines together and in synergy towards a breakthrough.
This call is open to early-stage research on any new technological possibility.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 2 and 4 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected impact: Proposals must aim at one of the following two impacts:
•                Initiating a radically new line of technology by establishing Proof-of-Principle of a new technological possibility and its new scientific underpinning, or
•                Kick-starting an emerging innovation eco-system of high-potential actors around a solid baseline of feasibility and potential for a new technological option, ready for early take-up.
The active involvement of new and high-potential research and innovation players, which may become the European scientific and technological leaders of the future, is encouraged. Impact is also sought in terms of take up of new research and innovation practices and, more generally, from making leading-edge science and technology research more open, collaborative, creative and closer to society.

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
To mature a number of novel areas and themes by working towards structuring emerging communities and supporting the design and development of transformative research themes. The main benefits of this structuring yet explorative approach are emerging novel areas that are not yet ready for inclusion in industry research roadmaps, and building up and structuring of new interdisciplinary research communities around them. It makes the step from collaborations between a small number of researchers, to larger collaborations addressing various aspects of a novel research theme to jointly explore possibilities for, and long-term implications of future technologies that matter.
Scope:
Proposals should address research and innovation activities, aimed at jointly exploring directions and options to establish a solid baseline of knowledge and skills, and to foster the emergence of a broader innovation ecosystem for a new technology as well as a fertile ground for its future take-up (e.g., through public engagement processes when relevant, or through formal and informal education). Proposals should address a single of the specific subtopics within one of the following areas:
Area 1: Future technologies for societal change
Being human in a technological world: critical interdisciplinary explorations of potentially game-changing impacts of future technologies on humanity, in plausible as well as in extreme scenarios. This can include individual, gender, organisational, economic, cultural and societal impacts, for instance from changes to self- or social perception, to our narratives, or to human development (e.g., cognitive, physical) or evolution. Visions being addressed should be radically forward looking and relatively unexplored, such as hyperconnectivity, human augmentation, hybridisation of nature, life extension, extra-sensorial perception or real/virtual blending. The work should provide fresh perspectives that challenge current thinking, include ethical and social aspects, reflecting on the purposes, impacts and motivations for the research and innovation activity, the associated uncertainties, areas of ignorance, assumptions, questions and dilemmas; and by this crystalize through active stakeholder engagement concrete options for shaping a worthwhile and responsible future.
New science for a globalised world : tools and methods (mathematical, technological, social/organisational,…) for the collaborative study, projection and engineering of large scale open socio-technological and –ecological systems characterised by complexity and inherent uncertainty due to, among others, partial knowledge, ignorance and conflicting world-views by different actors. These tools and methods should include the study of informal opinion groups emerging on the Internet at a global level, and focusing on global topics such as Global Systems Science as a new integrative science approach, the emergence of global solutions as patchworks of local ones, non-rationality, the impact of open-data, the dynamics of social and cultural divides, of peace and conflict, and various incentives, drivers and enablers of change and innovation, including the arts.
Area 2: Biotech for better life
Intra- and inter-cell bio-technologies: new technologies to enable the study and engineering of processes within and between biological cells, and their exploitation for purposes such as sensing, signalling, imaging, regulating, curing or for mimicking or re-engineering the intra- and inter-cell physics and dynamics. This can include the use of natural cells, optimised, therapeutic and compound, synthetic ones or combinations of these, as well as cell-free techniques. Where needed, multiscale mathematical modelling and computational simulation can be included. Proposals under this subtopic should also explore the paradigm-changing potential of these technologies, for instance in the bio-medical field.
Bio-electronic medicines and therapies: using adaptive nerve or brain stimulation for precise regulatory control of organs or other biological processes inside the human body, in order to restore or maintain healthy conditions. This includes technologies for bio-electronic medicines, drug-free therapies, adaptive drug release, closed-loop BNCI, more invasive stimulation, or development of neurotransmitter sensor/actuator systems, all within a setting of personalised and adaptive medicine and the tight integration of diagnostic and therapeutic capabilities (theranostics). A Responsible Research and Innovation approach, including aspects of ethics, as well as social science and humanities should be taken into account.
Cognitive neuro-technologies: integrated interdisciplinary approaches combining theory and novel technology-based experiments for understanding the circuits and pathways of higher-level cognitive functions (such as navigation, goal-oriented behaviour, motivation and reward, memory, knowledge and belief formation, reasoning and decision making, emotion, interaction, communication), the related principles of neural coding and operation within and between brain regions and the role of the physical and social/cultural environment in bringing them about. Proposals should focus on non-validated, leading-edge methodologies and technologies specifically relevant to cognitive neuroscience. Target applications could include, for example, adaptive human interfaces, specific brain interfaces and neuro-prosthetics to restore or support cognitive functions or to address unmet therapeutic needs.
Area 3: Disruptive information technologies
New computing paradigms and their technologies: new foundations for computing, including bio-, nature- and socio-inspired ones that can encompass also aspects of communication, interaction, mimickry or differentiation (adaptation, learning, evolution), as well as non-technological aspects like organisational or physical/virtual architectural ones, and tailored to future and emerging challenges and requirements in highly interdisciplinary settings and for new kinds of mathematical and computational approaches in science.
Quantum engineering: reproducible, economical and scaleable approaches, architectures and techniques for designing and realising devices and systems that exploit quantum phenomena, such as superposition and entanglement, for achieving new or radically improved functionalities (for instance in sensing, precision measurement, transduction, secure communication, control, simulation and computation) and demonstrated in the context and boundary conditions of a specific application area (for example in the biological, medical, materials, process, energy or standards domain).
Hybrid opto-electro-mechanical devices at the nano-scale: new working principles and their first-time validation in nano-, molecular- or atomic-scale devices based on the interaction and mutual control of multiple physical degrees of freedom to achieve new or radically improved functionalities and application scenarios under plausible operating conditions. The interacting degrees of freedom are those involved in e.g. nano-optics, nano-scale electromagnetism, nano-mechanics and phonons and fluctuations.
Area 4: New technologies for energy and functional materials
Ecosystem engineering:[1] new models, materials, processes, devices and systems going beyond a single dimension for extreme energy and resource efficiency and recovery, and footprint management into circular ecosystems (energy, raw materials, waste, water,…). New approaches and technologies for extremely efficient energy generation (e.g., artificial photosynthesis or microfluidic conversion), transfer, conversion, high-density storage and consumption. The targeted improvements with respect to the state of the art are to be stated in quantitative terms. Genuine cross-fertilisation and deep synergies between the broadest range of advanced sciences and cutting-edge engineering disciplines for emerging ecological technologies seeking holistic paradigms, striving to reduce or eliminate the environmental impact, and the replacement of toxic/pollutant substances by ecofriendly materials should be considered. First time validation and assessment of these results in the context of integrated synergetic circular economy solutions or other quasi self-sufficient environments.
Complex bottom-up construction: new technologies and methods for self-organisation, assembly and adaptation of materials and physical devices/systems with complex functionality (including for instance energy storage, conversion or recovery), complex composition and/or spanning a range of scales (nano, meso) and with superior properties on each of them. Energy and resource/material availability, ecofriendlyness and efficiency are to be taken into account). Where needed, multiscale mathematical modelling and computational simulation of materials and related production or self-organisation processes can be included.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 4 and 10 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. When appropriate, this allows for proposals to provide financial support to third parties in line with the conditions set out in Part K of the General Annexes, for example to access specific expertise, to enhance impacts or to award an inducement prize following a contest organised by the beneficiaries.
The Commission further considers that proposals with a duration up to 5 years would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals of different duration.
The funding budget per area is with a maximum of EUR 20 million for each of the areas 1 and 4, and a maximum of EUR 30 million for each of the areas 2 and 3.
Expected Impact:
Establish a solid baseline of knowledge and skills for a future technology in the theme addressed.
Goal oriented community structuring and true interdisciplinary collaboration.
Emergence of an innovation ecosystem around a future technology in the theme addressed from outreach to and partnership with high potential actors in research and innovation, and from wider stakeholder/public engagement.

","31 October 2017
","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
To explore and consolidate a new technological direction in order to put it firmly on the map as a viable paradigm for future technology. To foster the interdisciplinary communities that are able to drive this forward, extending from the participating consortia to a wider European pool of expertise. To stimulate the emergence of a European innovation eco-system around a new technological paradigm, well beyond the world of research alone.
Scope:
proposals are sought for cutting-edge high-risk / high-reward research and innovation projects that aim to demonstrate a new technological paradigm within the scope of one of the following sub-topics:
a. Artificial organs, tissues, cells and sub-cellular structures. Merging the growing understanding of genome, proteome, metabolome and cell behaviour with strategies for the engineering and use of biological and hybrid functional constructs is the core of this initiative. Proposals should build on recent advances in integrative biology (including modelling and simulation) and bio-engineering for engineering biological, artificial or hybrid sub-cellular systems (e.g., synapses, organelles, vesicles), highly specific cell assemblies (including microbial) and proper differentiation, tissues, organs or multi-organ systems. Examples of long-term research targets include synthetic cell building, cell assembly, and organ reproduction, replacement, control or repair of vital organ functions (e.g., following ageing, trauma or disease), their use in the development of personalised treatment, drugs or vaccines, and high-throughput organ- and body-on-chip technologies.
b. Time. This initiative seeks new technological possibilities inspired by notions of time, not seen as a given and singular background against which things unfold, but rather as a resource that can be experienced and used in different ways. Highly interdisciplinary research could address, for instance, technologies for subjective time awareness (and its neural basis) and distortion (e.g., contextual, emotional, pathological); for studying the role of time in processes like aging, healing, learning or evolution and how this can be influenced (e.g., stimulation) or changed in different 'materialities' (combining insights from biological or computational evolution, for instance); or modeling to understand and better anticipate non-linear temporality in complex systems (such as in economies, societies, climate ...). Technologies in, for instance, extreme electronics/photonics, data-streams analytics, time aware artificial intelligence, virtual and augmented reality, bio-engineering or neuroprosthetics could demonstrate new ways to represent, modulate, duplicate or differently experience and use time, thus altering our relationship with time (at individual and collective but differentiated level – e.g., according to gender or culture) and with impacts on, for instance, quality of life, therapy, learning, productivity, social and environmental awareness or the better understanding and management of natural hazards.
c. Living technologies. This initiative seeks to build on the emerging understanding from evolutionary biology, ethology, micro-, plant- and animal biology of essential features of living systems such as physical autonomy, growth, interaction and enaction, adaptation and evolution, among others. The aim is to create new functional biological, technological or hybrid artefacts, with similar capabilities of purposeful stability and change. This can also lead to hybrid materials and systems with programmable features of shape, structure, functionality and evolvability (including for their use in bio-robotics or bio-engineering), potentially constructed from naturally existing complexes, through synthetic biology, systems biology and /or chemical biology. New insights into the multi-level mathematics and complexity of living systems or the boundaries/characteristics of life may also emerge from this. Work on ethical implications should be included.
d. Socially interactive technologies. There is a growing understanding of the changes at cognitive, neural and physiological levels from group interactions in realistic settings, from pairs to large groups and crowds. Based on this, this initiative seeks new technologies for deeper social interaction involving, for instance, context, culture, emotion, and factors of embodiment and cognition. Realistic and larger contexts require new experimental tools and paradigms, combining social sciences and humanities with neuroscience, engineering and computing in new ways. This will lead to new socially interactive media with radical improvement for building trust and understanding, social integration, engagement, collaboration, learning, creativity, entertainment, education and wellbeing, among others. Work on ethical implications and gender should be included.
e. Disruptive micro-energy and storage technologies. This initiative seeks radically new approaches to energy for embedded, personal or local use (including bio-mimicking, the use of soft or intelligent materials to generate, capture or store energy or the development of new types of batteries). Proposals could target in particular the lower end (i.e., micro-energy or nano-scale energy transfer, dissipation and conversion) and/or new technologies for optimal local (close to where-needed) energy storage/release and their smart integration within hybrid/distributed energy systems. Proposals should also address aspects of sustainability and environmental impact.
f. Topological matter, strongly based on topology and quantum physics, is a rapidly emerging area that after an initial focus on insulators now touches the whole range of material properties, providing advances in spintronics, photonics, plasmas, mechanics, superconductivity, elasticity, acoustics and their combinations, among others. Here concept development together with design, realisation and testing of topological devices are called for to unleash the promise of topological matter beyond the pure physics and mathematics aspects. The much expected robustness, wide spectral range and topologically-protected spin- and transport properties call for an engineering approach to apply the multi-physics of wave-matter interactions to novel, potentially lossless communication components and circuits. Challenges to be addressed include compact designs and fabrication technologies, setting figures of merit and benchmarks relevant to functions.
FET Proactive projects shall establish a solid baseline of knowledge and skills and assemble the interdisciplinary communities around them. They shall further foster the emergence of a broader innovation ecosystem and create a fertile ground for future take-up of its new technological paradigm (e.g., public engagement, informal education, policy debate).
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of EUR 4 to 7 million (but up to EUR 5 million for proposals on the sub-topics of 'Time' and 'Topological matter') and with a duration of up to 5 years would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals of different size and duration.
This topic allows for the provision of financial support to third parties established in an EU member state or country associated with Horizon 2020 in line with the conditions set out in General Annex K, either to enhance impacts through punctual small scale experimentation and use of project results by third parties, or to award a prize following a contest organised by the beneficiaries.
Expected Impact:
Scientific and technological contributions to the foundation and consolidation of a radically new future technology.
Potential for future returns in terms of societal or economic innovation or market creation.
Spreading excellence and building leading innovation capacity across Europe by involvement of key actors that can make a difference in the future, for example excellent young, researchers, ambitious high-tech SMEs or first-time participants to FET under Horizon 2020[1].
Build-up of a goal oriented interdisciplinary community (within and beyond the consortium).
Emergence of an innovation ecosystem around a future technology in the theme addressed from outreach to and partnership with high potential actors in research and innovation, and from wider stakeholder/public engagement, with due consideration of aspects such as education, gender differences and long-term societal, ethical and legal implications.

Specific challenge: The ambition is to improve the way scientific knowledge can help inform and evaluate policy and societal responses to global challenges like climate change, global financial crises, global pandemics, and growth of cities – urbanisation and migration patterns. These challenges entangle actions across different sectors of policy and society and must be addressed by radically novel ideas and thinking for producing, delivering, and embedding scientific evidence into the policy and societal processes.
GSS will put to full use the abundance of data on social, economic, financial, technological, and ecological systems available today. GSS emphasises systems thinking and the need to integrate/link data, models, and policies across all policy sectors with all societal actors. GSS will build on results from, among others, Complex Systems Science, Network Science, Mathematics of Big Data, the life sciences, social sciences and humanities, behavioural sciences, statistics, econophysics, etc.
Scope: Proposals must address all of the below elements, necessary to successfully embed scientific evidence in the policy processes for tackling global challenges:
•                Research grounded in theoretical foundations of, among others, systemic risk, decision making under uncertainty or conflicting evidence, mathematics and computer science for Big Data (including their characteristics), algorithmic game theory, cascading/escalating effects in networks, integration and visualisation of Big Data…
•                Contributions to solving real world problems in one selected problem area - for instance tackling systemic risk in finance/economics, managing growth of cities and migration, or global pandemics – and in particular to tackle cross-cutting policy dependencies and interactions affecting the area of choice.
•                Novel ideas and technologies to generate and better communicate the scientific evidence-base: advanced simulation of highly interconnected systems; mathematical and tools for analysing (often unstructured) Big Data; integration of the whole spectrum of structure and unstructured data; methods to deal with conflicting data and modeling results; novel data visualisation tools.
•                Society/human-centred technologies, for instance, new approaches to allow citizens to actively participate in the policy process, to collectively gather and integrate data, analyse evidence, and novel methods to better judge and use scientific evidence: methods, e.g. games, gamification, and narratives to clearly and consistently convey data and modeling results and thereby to stimulate societal responses.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 2 and 3 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected impact:
•                Level to which research proposed is rooted in policy needs, promotes system thinking, and is delivering consistent messages from conflicting data and model results.
•                Level of use/uptake of GSS tools and methods in the policy and societal processes, including in EC policies.
•                  Capacity of GSS to help integrate societal responses across policy domains and cross-cutting authorities by development of a system-wide integrated evidence base of data and models.

The challenge is to make Europe the best place in the world for collaborative research and innovation on future and emerging technologies that will secure and renew the basis for future European competitiveness and growth, and that will make a difference for society in the decades to come.
Scope:
Proposals should address only one of the following subtopics:
FET Communication [2016]: raising the visibility and impact of FET through novel and creative approaches for reaching out to various stakeholders and well beyond the research communities. This may include, for example, collecting, aggregating and disseminating information from the entire range of FET projects and activities, and using an appropriate mix of channels and formats to engage with the target audiences, including scientists, students, media, policy makers, the business community and the general public. This subtopic should include public engagement processes as discussed in the introduction of this FET Work Programme.
FET Exchange [2016]: actions for structuring and strengthening an emerging FET-relevant science and technology research and innovation topic and the interdisciplinary communities involved in this topic. This may include, for example, research roadmapping, stimulating (formal and informal) learning and exchange, expanding the range of disciplines (including the life sciences and humanities where relevant), involving new actors such as young researchers, entrepreneurs and high-tech SMEs, and broadening stakeholder engagement (multi-actor or citizen). One specific theme that may be addressed is the area of alternative metrics (so-called ""altmetrics"") to assess research outputs and researchers.
FET Conference [2016]: supporting the organisation of the third European Future and Emerging Technologies Conference and Exhibition (see for example http://www.fet11.eu/ ). The conference shall showcase progress and results from FET research, attract high-tech SMEs, investors and entrepreneurs that might take FET results forward, seed new ideas across disciplines, foster a dialogue between science, policy and society on future and emerging technologies (through public engagement), explore new ways of combining research and innovation and involve high-potential actors that will make the difference. Proposals will address pre-conference communication activities, the local organisation, participant assistance and post-conference follow-up. The event shall take place in early 2018.
FET Innovation Greenhouse [2016]: actions for establishing a Europe-wide capacity for innovation, exploitation and entrepreneurship stemming from the visionary, high-risk interdisciplinary science and technology research supported by FET. Greenhouse provides innovation support services to help bridging the gap between FET research and its application in industry and for society. The focus should be on enabling the earlier creative and learning stages of innovation from FET research, for which the classical path of business plans and investors is still premature, many options are still open and a more exploratory, risk-friendly and tailored support is needed. A wide technological scope, a strong specificity to FET and complementarity with existing greenhouse initiatives and innovation services are of prime importance. This subtopic also welcomes support to the actions funded under the FET Innovation Launchpad (FETOPEN-04-2016-2017) and for networking and exchange among them.
For each of the scope items a) and c) at most one action will be funded.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 0.3 and 0.5 million for scope items a), b) and d), and up to EUR 1 million for the scope item c), would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
Strengthening globally recognised European leadership in the early exploration of visionary, new and emerging technologies, beyond academic excellence and with a strong engagement of scientists, citizens, innovators and policy makers.
Improved long-term innovation potential in Europe both from the abundance of novel ideas and the range of actors ready to take them forward.
Improved understanding of the range of possible impact mechanisms for long-term science and technology research.
Improved readiness across Europe to engage in silo-breaking research collaboration and to take up new research and innovation practices.

Deadline date","Scope:
Specific challenge: This initiative addresses the interdisciplinary fundamentals of knowing, thinking, doing and being, in close synergy with foundational research on future artificial cognitive systems, robots, smart artefacts and large scale cyber-physical systems. It aims at renewing ties between the different disciplines studying knowledge (especially beyond the 'declarative' and static action oriented kind of knowledge), cognition (e.g., perception, understanding, learning, action) and related issues (e.g., embodiment, thinking, development, insight, knowledge as a social construct, identity, responsibility, culture…) from various perspectives (e.g., physical, biological, neuronal, behavioural, social, epistemological, ecological). The aim is to enable new synergies with engineering disciplines on smart and self-organising materials, embedded systems, robotics, hybrid systems or smart infrastructures and cities to take artificial cognitive systems beyond the level of dull task execution or repetitive problem solving.
Scope: Proposals must address at least one of the following elements:
•                New concepts and paradigms in cognitive systems such as new approaches to embodiment, learning, motivation, autonomy, knowledge and mind, not limited to prior anthropocentric or bio-mimetic models. Proposals will aim to demonstrate these paradigms in robust performance of future robotic systems (possibly nano-, micro-, multi-, hybrid- or unconventional ones) in challenging changing environments, possibly co-habited with or linked to biological systems, and over long periods of time.
•                Integrative studies of knowing, thinking, doing and being that bridge between low-level (e.g., neuronal, physiological) and high-level (e.g., belief, intention, identity) descriptions. These multidisciplinary studies are expected to go well beyond addressing the perception-action loop, and to tackle issues such as development, experience, understanding, empathy, memory, attention, the emergence and development of self, social belonging and culture. They are to be researched in close synergy with technological experiments, for instance in computational neuroscience, intelligent materials, robotics, cyber physical settings or large scale simulations that incorporate, test and refine insights gained.
•                Approaches for understanding the long-term development of individual and social knowledge and identities, especially in highly heterogeneous and dynamic settings (reflecting aspects of e.g., diversity, urban change, migration, social and gender divides, multiculturalism, inter-disciplinarity, etc.). Proposals are expected to take into account the role of technologies and infrastructures in this, as well as how these facilitate or hamper societal changes.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 2 and 4 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected impact:
•                New foundations for future robotics and other artificial cognitive systems with clear progress beyond current capabilities and design concepts.
•                A deeper understanding of non-performative aspects of development and interaction in mixed human/technological settings.
•                Improved understanding of the impacts of the technologically enhanced environments on the human behaviour, at the individual and collective levels
•                Understanding the origins and development of synergies and divides in socio/technical contexts and ways to influence them.

","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Recent trends in nationalism, protectionism and regionalism are affecting international commitments and policies. They also put added pressure on the political and operational capacities of global governance institutions created in the mid-twentieth century for critical yet partly different purposes. This raises the prospects of shifts, including in responsibility, in global and transnational governance. The challenge is to identify coherent responses and to effectively coordinate their implementation with stakeholders.
Scope:
Proposals should assess contemporary and historical developments in key institutions (e.g. United Nations, North Atlantic Treaty Organisation, World Trade Organisation, Organisation for Security and Cooperation), regimes, processes and partnerships that aim at contributing to collective action and sharing responsibilities in taking on global problem solving. They should also investigate the EU’s role in these processes. In addition, proposals should assess challenges faced by global governance such as representativeness, diverging interests, trust, allocating responsibilities and legitimacy as well as difficulties related to the implementation of agreements. Responses to past challenges should also be assessed. Scenarios of stagnation, transformation or fragmentation should be considered. The impact on the implementation of the EU Global Strategy and on the achievement of the climate goals of the Paris Agreement and the Sustainable Development Goals of Agenda 2030 should be addressed. The role played by non-state actors, including from the civil and private sectors may also be addressed. Relevant actors (e.g. researchers, policymakers, civil society representatives) should be involved to ensure mutual learning and take-up of results. Due to the specific challenge of this topic, participation of international partners strategically targeted by the EU is encouraged to ensure joint mapping, scenario design and policy recommendations.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU in the order of EUR 2.5 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
The action will equip relevant EU actors and partners with knowledge and tools for navigating and influencing effectively the emerging and future shifts in global and transnational governance, thereby increasing their readiness, resilience and capacities for developing globally coordinated strategies.

","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
New and emerging markets outside Europe offer huge opportunities for the European industry. To compete effectively in these markets, European companies and especially SMEs need to develop partnerships with innovation players in these economies from early on and to develop receptiveness for local success. This is crucial to better understand the specific market context and the consequent needs and demands of emerging users and consumers. The end goal is to bring a new product, service or process to the foreign market, possibly through an innovative application of existing technologies, methodologies, or business processes.
Scope:
This action will enhance the evidence base for EU R&I policy through in-depth analyses of the outcomes, experiences and impacts of a critical number of viability assessment projects of innovative solutions for markets outside Europe.
The assessment projects will be selected following a series of open calls organised by the action. The proposal for undertaking the action should define the organisational process for selecting the assessment projects for which financial support will be granted, including the process of selecting, allocating and reporting on the use of independent experts and ensuring no conflicts of interest.
At least 80% of the EU funding shall be allocated to financial support for the third parties carrying out the selected assessment projects. The series of open calls shall address markets of developing countries, large emerging economies (Brazil, Russia, India, China, Mexico) and developed countries with roughly the same allocation for each of these three country category.
The calls should specify that each assessment project should include a wide variety of activities to explore the practical, technological and commercial viability of an innovative solution in particular in terms of how it needs to meet local conditions and demands.
The proposal must clearly detail a fixed and exhaustive list of the different types of activities for which a third party may receive financial support such as market studies, partner search and networking, approaches for client/user involvement including societal, behavioural and cultural aspects, and other activities aimed at overcoming barriers for market introduction and uptake.
The proposal must clearly detail the criteria for awarding financial support and simple and comprehensive criteria for calculating the exact amount of such support, which may not exceed EUR 60 000 for each assessment project. The award criteria must be objective and non-discriminatory.
Each assessment project shall be led by an entity established in an EU Member State or Horizon 2020 Associated Country and shall involve at least one entity not established in an EU Member State or Horizon 2020 Associated Country. The proposal shall specify whether and how the latter would be funded according to its type of involvement (e.g. subcontractor, cooperation agreement) and its geographic origin (country automatically eligible for funding or not according to Horizon 2020 rules). Highly innovative SMEs with clear commercial ambitions and potential for high growth and internationalisation shall be targeted in particular.
The open calls must be published widely, including on the Horizon 2020 Participants Portal and through National Contact Points, and Horizon 2020 standards with respect to transparency, equal treatment, no conflict of interest and respect of confidentiality must be adhered to. The results of the calls must be published without delay, including, for each assessment project, a description of the project, the legal name and country of the third party, the start date and duration of the project, and the amount of the award.
The proposal should specify how it will promote the calls, how it will monitor and report on call results and how it will assess the quality of the outcomes and experiences from the assessment projects, as well as how it will provide regular in-depth analyses and which indicators will be used for measuring the impacts achieved. Analyses should draw up R&I policy conclusions on questions such as which additional joint R&I activities in third countries should be supported, what framework conditions for R&I cooperation need improving, and what further R&I support services should be implemented.
The Commission considers that a proposal requesting a contribution from the EU of up to EUR 9 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of a proposal requesting another amount. The selected beneficiary or beneficiaries should have a solid operational and financial capacity.
Expected Impact:
- Economic growth and job creation, both in Europe and in the target countries, as well as additional societal and environmental benefits.
- Increased European economic and industrial competitiveness and excellence and participation in international value chains.
- Inclusion of locally developed and accepted technology and business models, including through co-creation with innovation players in the target countries.
- Greater availability, uptake and use of innovative solutions responding to the specific local needs and circumstances of the target countries and markets.
- R&I policy conclusions based on better connections and larger insights into market conditions outside Europe.

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
There are signs that conventional conceptions of democratic governance are disrupted. The legitimacy of traditional democratic institutions appears challenged by decreasing trust in their capability to provide solutions to pressing societal problems. Also phenomena such as rising populism and extremism, including violent extremism, pose a challenge to sound democratic deliberation and to liberal-democratic norms. There is a need for understanding the underlying dynamics behind these phenomena and to identify and propose means and instruments for sustainable and resilient democratic governance for the future.
Scope:
Activities under this action should analyse what are the major challenges to democratic governance. It should explore the scale and nature of these challenges, their causes and underlying mechanisms, as well as their consequences and effects on democracy. Research should address fundamental issues such as the relation between capitalism and democracy and should explore, also from a historical perspective, the evolution of the democratic institutions of governance at local, national and EU level. In particular, research should take into consideration the impact of, e.g. rising inequalities, the politics of threat, democratisation of information, shifting identities and representation and the changing authority of institutions. It should also consider alternative action repertoires and their impact on democratic governance. Recent institutional developments and proposals at EU level, such as the introduction of Spitzenkandidaten in the EU election process and the proposal to join the presidency of the Commission and European Council Presidencies should be evaluated. Research should be embedded in, and have due regard to, wider historical perspectives on Europe. Research should also analyse the shifting impact of e.g. educational and socio-economic background, identity (e.g. national, regional, ethnic, religious, cultural) and other factors on political allegiances and on forms and levels of societal involvement. The action requires comprehensive, innovative, interdisciplinary and comparative research.
This ERA-NET Co-fund will pool resources from participating states from all regions of Europe, including the Southern, Central and Eastern European countries. Proposals are required to implement other joint activities, including additional joint calls without EU co-funding.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of maximum EUR 3 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
The Co-fund will engender effective transnational, pan-European research networks and create European value added synergies substantially enriching the knowledge base in this field. Research outputs will be highly policy relevant and inform policy making at various levels of governance. This requires involvement of stakeholders in the shaping of research design, approaches as well as dissemination. Research will make recommendations on how democratic governance can be made more resilient, what interventions are needed to this facilitate this, and whether and how it needs to be renegotiated.

“Social sciences and humanities research will be fully integrated into each of the priorities of Horizon 2020 and each of the specific objectives and will contribute to the evidence base for policy making at international, Union, national, regional and local level. In relation to societal challenges, social sciences and humanities (SSH) will be mainstreamed as an essential element of the activities needed to tackle each of the societal challenges to enhance their impact”.
This statement in the Horizon 2020 regulation opens the way to an ambitious policy of SSH integration and its measurement and impact. Beyond the actual practices of “SSH integration” within Horizon 2020 already monitored by the European Commission this Coordination and Support Action should look at integration/interdisciplinarity practices within and outside of Horizon 2020 both between SSH and other sciences as well as between the diverse disciplines within the social sciences and humanities, in Europe and, where relevant at national or local level. The challenge is to learn and further build on these practices.
Scope:
Interdisciplinarity for this topic means interdisciplinarity between SSH and other sciences as well as interdisciplinarity between the diverse disciplines within the social sciences, humanities and the arts. Furthermore, the European Commission supports a genuine integration of SSH, meaning that the SSH are not an “add-on” to other sciences but are fully mobilised, like other sciences, in building collectively the relevant scientific interdisciplinary questions for answering Europe’s societal challenges. Finally, the Commission recognises that interdisciplinarity between SSH and other sciences is only one among several scientific approaches (i.e. mono-disciplinarity and other kinds of interdisciplinarity) and therefore that the policy to support “SSH integration” needs to be justified and selective.
The scope of this topic is thus neither concentrated on the epistemology of interdisciplinarity, nor on the ad hoc contribution of SSH to other sciences, but is rather meant for SSH experts, in close cooperation with experts from other sciences, to take a leading role in analysing the actual practices and potential of interdisciplinarity in Europe, inside and outside Horizon 2020, as well as their outputs and impacts.
Proposals should be able to scan a wide array of practices and indicators of interdisciplinarity between SSH and non-SSH sciences in Europe, whether at national level or at bilateral or multilateral level, including third countries where relevant. They should analyse best practices but also instances of failed attempts at such interdisciplinarity. On this basis, they should try to give better socio-institutional accounts of various types of interdisciplinarity and their outputs and impacts. They should analyse the conditions for supporting meaningful interdisciplinarity between SSH and other sciences, including through evaluations of programmes and projects and researchers’ career development, and suggest whether new kinds of tools or institutional solutions could become, in a feedback loop, relevant within the Framework Programme or outside it. Based on empirical evidence of existing or nascent interdisciplinary cooperation between SSH and other sciences, proposals should also assess the potential for interdisciplinarity for responding to the different societal challenges that Europe needs to tackle, in areas like health, food and agriculture, energy and climate change, technological innovation, security or any other relevant emerging area. They should thus point to established, nascent or potential areas where interdisciplinarity between SSH and other sciences could be more adequately supported.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU in the order of EUR 1.5 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
The action will contribute to developing a policy for integration/interdisciplinarity between SSH and other sciences at European level based on empirical experiences of this kind of interdisciplinarity. It will also allow the identification of areas or issues which show potential for genuine interdisciplinary cooperation between SSH and other sciences, which would deserve to be supported in the future in order to meet Europe’s societal challenges.

Boosting social rights can help address divergence in social trends among Member States and reduce the risk of socio-economic shocks. At the same time, social rights are essential for the full realisation of EU citizenship and reaching the EU's targets in reducing poverty and social exclusion. By mitigating social risks and by assisting people with transitions and vulnerabilities, social rights can boost trust to public governance. The challenge is to integrate the social dimension into European policies and to connect it with European citizenship going beyond the traditional focus on mobile citizens to look also at those who are ""immobile"".
Scope:
Proposals should examine how European citizens have been exercising social rights (e.g. to social protection, housing, health, education, access to labour markets, working conditions, including health and safety at work, mobility) in the wake of the economic crisis. The role of the Member States in protecting social rights should be considered as well as the situation of underrepresented and vulnerable groups, including gender aspects. Proposals should analyse how the EU supports citizens' access to social rights and policy levers to foster upward social convergence in the design of employment policies and social protection systems. They should equally establish the relationship between social policy instruments in Member States and outcomes in terms of social inclusion and fairness and should identify policy priorities. Furthermore, they should assess EU social indicators such as the at-risk-of-poverty rate, material deprivation and quasi-joblessness, thereby aiming to strengthen the statistical base. Developments concerning the European Pillar of Social Rights should be studied, including how they can contribute to the exercise of social rights and to social cohesion. The European Pillar of Social Rights brings forward key social rights of citizens structured around three categories: equal opportunities and access to the labour market, fair working conditions, and social protection and inclusion. The merits or pitfalls of a potential harmonisation in social policy among Member States should be investigated. Proposals should also explore conceptualisations and possible content of social citizenship and may consider citizens' own perceptions and understandings of the social dimension of citizenship. Furthermore, attention should be given to the complex links between the exercise of social rights of European citizens and developments in terms of economic growth, inequality trends and social well-being. Studies should also include a historical and comparative dimension when examining the interplay between these factors in European countries.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU in the order of EUR 3 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
The action will contribute to advancing the state of the art and normative content of EU social citizenship. It will also contribute to the implementation of the European Pillar of Social Rights. It will put forward recommendations on the exercise of EU social rights as an integral part of EU citizenship and on upward convergence. It will also contribute to constructing narratives of European citizenship.

Specific Challenge: The strategic implementation plan (SIP) of the European innovation partnership on active and healthy ageing (EIP-AHA) has identified a number of priority action areas. In a subset of these, stakeholder action groups have developed action plans for implementing innovative services for the ageing population. Another subset of priority action areas addresses domains whose readiness towards implementation is maturing and may soon give rise to additional action plans.
The EIP-AHA has invited, among others, the European Commission to establish favourable framework conditions to implement the actions outlined in the SIP. The European Commission, in its Communication ""Taking forward the Strategic Implementation Plan of the European Innovation Partnership on Active and Healthy Ageing"", committed to take account of relevant priorities of the SIP, together with input from other stakeholders, for future research and innovation work programmes and instruments.
Support is therefore required in facilitating: the execution of action plans, the establishment of favourable framework conditions for the deployment of the intended innovative services, and the future development of further action plans and priority areas.
Scope: Proposals should provide coordinated support to the activities of the EIP-AHA as follows:
Support the existing action groups in implementing their action plans. The support may relate for example to coordination of action group activities, communication among partners and dissemination of results;
Support the development of new action plans coming from more priority action areas identified in the strategic implementation plan of the EIP-AHA, and subsequently, support the newly formed action groups in the same way as described above;
In collaboration with relevant stakeholders, including those from civil society, identify any new areas that can be regarded as future priority action areas, and develop a roadmap of research priorities, which are needed in the context of the existing and future priority action areas;
Work together with the European Commission, with relevant legislative and standardisation initiatives and with national, regional and local authorities in developing recommendations for more favourable regulatory and standardisation conditions, innovative procurement and incentive mechanisms.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 1 and 2 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected impact:
Proposals should present quantitative or qualitative indicators to quantify the potential impact of the following.
• Enhanced communication among EIP-AHA stakeholders, enhanced coordination of activities in the Action Groups of EIP-AHA and enhanced communication of their results.
• Identification of priority areas for Research and Innovation actions in the domain of Active and Healthy Ageing.
• Accelerated progress in the establishment of favourable framework conditions to implement the actions outlined in the Action Plans of the EIP-AHA.

","Recognition Prize
","22 March 2017
","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
With their capacity to connect people, places, public and private actors, urban areas can substantially enhance innovation in Europe. Building on the success of this award first as a pilot and then as a full scale action in 2015, the award will continue in 2017 with a deeply renewed approach.
As in the first editions, it will aim to provide European recognition to those cities that make the most to promote innovation within their communities and thereby improve the quality of their citizens’ lives. The new award will strengthen its bottom-up approach by turning into a scheme to pilot citizens-led initiatives. It will mainly focus on experimentation, i.e. it will reward a city willing to propose itself as test-bed and run citizens-driven initiatives to find solutions for their relevant societal challenges. Impact will be a leading principle along with citizens' involvement.
The winning city will be awarded a prize of EUR 1,000,000. A second and a third prize of EUR 100,000 each will be also provided to the second and the third ranked (runner-ups) to support their networking activities. However, these cities will not hold the Capital of Innovation title.
For the purpose of this award, cities are considered as a whole system, including built environment, municipal authorities and citizens, organizations and public structures, as a platform capable of facilitating the growth and development of creativity and innovation in its different meanings.
The specific rules of the contest will be published in 2017 by the European CommissionOn the Participant Portal but also actively publicised elsewhere to maximise participation. The Commission will directly launch and manage the contest and award the prize based on the judgement of independent experts.
Expected Impact:
The award will illustrate on a European scale the commitment to innovation at city level, and will serve as model that can inspire and identify best practice to be replicated in other cities. At the city level, the recognition of successful innovation policies will raise the profile of the team and the political leaders that have developed and implemented these policies. The award will also help the city open up connections with other cities willing to learn and check which policies and activities could be transferable. This will allow the city to attract international interest in its activities.
Moreover, the prize will enhance citizens' feeling to contribute to the decision-making process, and will particularly stimulate them to develope new innovation activities, thus facilitating the city attractiveness towards investors, industry, top class researchers as well as talented and entrepreneurial individuals.

","02 July 2014
","single-stage
Deadline date","Scope:
Specific challenge: The specific challenge is to address networking gaps and deficiencies between the research institutions of the low performing Member States and regions and internationally-leading counterparts at EU level. Driven by the quest for excellence, research intensive institutions tend to collaborate increasingly in closed groups, producing a crowding-out effect for a large number of promising institutions. This is the challenge that a specific Twinning action will try to address.
Scope: Twinning aims at significantly strengthening a defined field of research in a particular knowledge institution (a research active university or a public research organisation or a private non-profit research organisation) by creating a link between this institution and at least two internationally-leading research institutions in other Member States. Twinning will:
Enhance the S&T capacity of the linked institutions;
Help raise staff’s research profile as well as the one of the institutions involved.
Successful Twinning proposals will have to clearly outline the scientific strategy for stepping up and stimulating scientific excellence and innovation capacity in a defined area of research as well as the scientific quality of the partners involved in the twinning exercise. They are also encouraged to explain how the Twinning activity will contribute to the overall Smart Specialisation Strategy of the specific location of the initiating institution.
Such a strategy should include a comprehensive set of measures to be supported. These should include at least a number of the following : short term staff exchanges; expert visits and short-term on-site or virtual training; workshops; conference attendance; organisation of joint summer school type activities; dissemination and outreach activities. Twinning activities will provide no support to infrastructure and equipment and no support for hiring new permanent research staff.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of EUR 1 million, would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected impact: There will be a measurable and significant improvement in the overall scientific and innovation capacity of the initiating institution in a particular field of research through linking with research intensive counterpart institutions in other Member States and thereby expect positive impacts on the overall research and innovation potential of the Member State or the region the initiating institution is located in. Such improvement could be measured through an increase of peer-reviewed publications, increased impact factors in terms of citations etc.
Impact indicators should reflect an increase in relative terms based on the situation before the project compared to the projected situation immediately after the project is completed, as well as within the foreseeable future after completion. These indicators are important for determining the potential regional and national impact, as well as long-term sustainability and viability of the beneficiary organisations.

With their capacity to connect people, places, public and private actors, cities can substantially enhance innovation in Europe and improve the quality of citizens’ lives. New approaches to undertake and deploy innovative practices are gaining support, marking the shift from traditional top-down schemes to stronger bottom-up practices, where citizens are increasingly co-shaping public policies in an open, transparent way.
Scope:
The traditional city innovation ecosystem is opening up to new models of innovation engaging citizens. An increasing number of cities are acting as test-beds for innovation and run citizens-driven initiatives to find solutions for their relevant societal challenges.
The public domain is particularly challenged with finding effective ways to ensure the mainstreaming of these practices into the ordinary urban development process. Successful practices are particularly crucial to enhance the city's capacity to attract new resources, funds and talents, and become role models for other cities.
Expected Impact:
A European prize to the most innovative city ecosystem. The award will raise the profile of the city teams that have developed and implemented innovative policies; enhance citizens' role in finding local solutions and participating in the decision-making process; facilitate the city attractiveness towards investors, industry, top class talents and entrepreneurial individuals; help the city open up connections with others and cooperate with them, thus inspiring and helping identify best practices to be replicated across Europe.

Projects should contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:
Produce theoretically and empirically robust visions for the future of liberal democratic institutions.
Reflect upon and actualise what liberal democracy means in the 21st century in Europe.
Develop recommendations, toolkits, narratives and methodologies to reinstate the legitimacy and effectiveness of liberal democracies.
Scope:
European societies are traversed by a multiplicity of identities, attitudes, cultural backgrounds and constitutional traditions. In the face of increasing complexity, certain political forces have promoted a vision of homogeneity, hierarchical control and order. Some extremist and some populist discourses, while not necessarily overlapping, have promoted strict majoritarian and nativist interpretations of democratic governance. Some have been challenging key tenets of liberal democracy like the protection of the rule of law, the separation of powers, women’s and minorities’ rights, etc. altogether or with some variation, providing visions that often conflict with EU priorities. These narratives figure prominently in public discourse and inform public opinion. They influence public views on pluralism and fundamental rights, but also inspire counter discourses and resistance. In addition, populist rhetoric also tends to crystallise in debates about borders and border control, where a tension emerges between the liberal policies of states and the actions called for. Together with the strengthening of the powers of executives, these developments could potentially undermine the stability of democracies. Furthermore, the liberal democratic model is challenged by non-liberal global players, such as China and Russia, and other external factors such as the COVID-19 pandemic and climate crisis. These external challenges paint a poor picture of democracies’ ability to solve collective problems in comparison to other actors, while disconnecting economic and political power from democracy on the global stage. A philosophic, sociological, legal, economic, historical and political reflection is needed on the foundations of liberal democratic governance in order to establish a viable conception of liberal democracy for the future.
Proposals are expected to address some of the following points: To examine the internal (within nation-states) and external challenges to liberal democracy and the discourses, social structures and institutions that underpin them. They should illustrate how such discourses depict social and political subjects as well as the structure of modern societies and institutions. How do these counter basic tenets of liberal democracy? When and why are they successful, or not? Long-term trends in the functioning of key elements of European liberal democracies (fundamental and human rights of individuals – such as freedom of expression, of assembly, of non-discrimination –, the rule of law, pluralism, separation of powers, access to justice, the independence of the judiciary and the media, protection of minorities, right to asylum, etc.) and their public legitimacy should be analysed and compared. Proposals may want to relate these to the impacts of major political and economic challenges of the past decades (e.g. the Great Recession, Cold War, dislocation of empires, “war on terror”, large inflows of mixed migration, the recent pandemic, etc.). The potential tension between liberal, egalitarian and other ideals held by citizens or promoted by political movements can also be examined. Proposals should analyse how institutional and political mechanisms built into European liberal democracies have functioned as limits and as a response to illiberal developments (e.g. checks and balances, enforcement of the rule of law). They should also examine how these mechanisms have evolved in recent years as a response to new threats. Research may provide theoretically rigorous and normatively informed reflections on how political liberalism can be actualised in order to take on the discourses that challenge liberal democracy. Finally, proposals should show the corresponding implications for the institutions of democratic governance.

Projects are expected to contribute to the following expected outcome:
Theoretically and empirically robust recommendations aiming to instil greater democratic accountability and inclusion in economic processes.
Scope:
Since WWII, substantial progress has been made in Europe in terms of economic development, improving life conditions and allowing (and enabling) the consolidation of liberal democracies. However, in recent decades the intensification of economic globalisation, market de-regulation and the financialisation of economies have posed new challenges to democratic governance. Global corporatised and financialised capitalism has created dynamic economic systems that produce material wealth but at the same time pose challenges to democracy, fundamental rights, social inclusion, reversing inequalities (including gender inequality), welfare, as well as the sustainability of our ecological system and climate change. On the other hand, alternative business models (e.g. social economy organisations and social enterprises) have emerged in reaction to this evolution. They operate on the basis of democratic and participatory principles and prioritise their societal mission over their profits.
Proposals are expected to address some of the following points: To study the interrelationship between politics, people’s participation, culture and economics in modern European democracies across time. In this vein, to comparatively analyse the role of various democratic institutional configurations and actors in mitigating the negative effects of economic activity on society and on democratic processes, while promoting inclusive and sustainable growth. How can democratic politics exercise control over the economic logic? How can re-embedding democracy and (the various forms of) capitalism be envisaged? How do economic actors, such as corporations, influence the democratic process? Through what channels (political parties, media, sponsorship, etc.)? What is the real impact of corporate lobbying on the democratic process? Research may study trends in capital accumulation and distribution, especially in new digital and creative industries, and the impacts they have on the functioning of democracies. Proposals should examine legal, social, economic, organisational and financial innovations that could make corporations more inclusive, accountable and conducive to social fairness and environmental sustainability, while preserving their innovation and flexibility. What would be the legitimate level of democratic governance over the economy (local, national, supranational)? In which ways can business corporations be held responsible to respect human rights? What kind of institutional mechanisms could guide the interaction of the various governance levels? Alternative economic models (including social economy organisations and social enterprises) and new models of corporate governance can be studied, in which case their success in fostering inclusive economic growth, enhancing democratic participation and improving environmental sustainability should be evaluated. Finally, proposal are encouraged to identify social innovation policies that would support such new governance models.

Projects are expected to contribute to both of the following expected outcomes:
Promote gender equality theoretically and practically through policy recommendations, tools, and solutions for civil society organisations and other stakeholders. As a result, support the quality of democratic governance in more inclusive European societies.
Understand how feminism and gender are used in extreme populist discourses, and counter gender-equality repressive strategies and policies.
Scope:
Gender equality is a fundamental value of the European Union and lies at the core of European democracy. This is reinforced by the Gender Equality Strategy 2020-2025, adopted by the European Commission, which recognises that much remains to be done to ensure true gender equality in our democratic processes. Recent developments, such as the #MeToo movement, have given new impetus to feminist discourses and politics. At the same time, however, there has been a societal and political backlash against feminism centred around traditionalist, masculinist and authoritarian discourses. Research is needed on the theory and practice of feminism(s), in the face of a changed and changing reality in the EU and beyond, including in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Projects are expected to address some of the following points: To examine the contribution of modern theoretical frameworks of feminist thought and gender analysis – including, e.g., care ethics, ecofeminism, intersectional theory and inclusive feminism, queer theory, masculinity studies –, as well as activism and political practices, to the renewal of fundamental political concepts like equality, identity, solidarity, order, security, individual and collective rights, participation, dialogue, etc. in modern democratic contexts across the EU and beyond. Research should investigate the strategies and effects of anti-gender and anti-feminist mobilisations in the EU and beyond – including, e.g., the use of traditional and social media, online hate speech and harassment, demonstrations, as well as restrictions to academic freedom – and their connections with the positioning of extreme populist discourses, political actors and traditionalist religious movements.
Based on the evidence collected and analysed, proposals should develop approaches and methods to effectively ‘engender’ democracy and spaces of democratic participation and governance, taking into account intersections between gender and other social categories such social class, ethnicity, sexual orientation, religion etc. in European societies (intersectionality), and practically counteract anti-gender equality and anti-feminist discursive strategies and backlash tactics.

Specific challenge: The research and innovation potential of the Member States remain very different, with large gaps between “innovation leaders” and “modest innovators”. This divide is equally present in Europen health research and innovation.
Two major European instruments – the Research Framework Programme and the Structural Funds – attempt to address this issue, albeit from distinct perspectives, but with the same strategic goals of serving the Europe2020 strategy for smart, sustainable and inclusive growth.
There is no one-size-fits-all solution. Therefore, new approaches specific to health research and innovation are needed that take into account the individual differences of the less performing RDI regions and provide tailor-made recommendations.
Scope: To tackle successfully the divide in European health research, both evidence based analysis and remedial actions are needed. Proposals may address either analysis or remedial actions, or both.
Proposals should examine the current health research activities in the less performing RDI regions/countries, looking into determinants influencing the health R&I performance. Strategies of these regions (RIS3 – Research and Innovation Strategies for Smart Specialisation) can be studied, and specific indicators can be identified to measure development. Proposals should reveal the factors underlying the divide; identify common patterns and individual differences within these regions. Outcomes should include suggested European and local actions to alleviate differences in health R&I.
For remedial actions, proposals should develop new approaches to unlock excellence in those regions.
Proposals should create a networking platform where companies, research organisations, universities, national authorities and managers of H2020 and structural funds can talk to each other to identify the needs, obstacles, best practice, opportunities.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of up to EUR 500.000 would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected impact: Within the health R&I domain, the action(s) should contribute to three important Horizon 2020 goals:
Widening participation
Bridging the innovation divide
Synergies between H2020 and Structural Funds

Specific challenge: Ensuring that research and innovation in this societal challenge is not only excellent, but also relevant and responsive to the needs of all is important, not least in ensuring the uptake of results.
Scope: Mobilisation and Mutual Learning Action Plans (MML) are one means of ensuring the engagement of all relevant groups and aim to tackle research and innovation related challenges by creating partnerships with a variety of perspectives, knowledge and experience. 
MMLs are Coordination and Support Actions (CSA) with at least 10 countries that allow discussion and cooperation between science and society at different stages of the research and innovation process. MMLs comprise at least one of each of the following types of partners: research performing or funding organisations, industry/businesses, policy makers, Civil Society Organisations. The consortium may also include media, education establishments, science academies, museums, science centres, etc. Ensuring a balanced distribution of roles and responsibilities between the different types of participants shall be evaluated under evaluation criterion 2.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of up to EUR 1 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
 Expected impact: The MML should contribute to the implementation of ‘Science with and for Society’ issues (public engagement, ethics, gender perspectives, science education, communication and access to and dissemination of scientific information) in the area of health. It shlould develop a common communication and implementation strategy to further the implementation of the MML outcomes and recommendations. It should contribute to relevant EU related initiatives and policy developments at local, national and European levels.

Prepare a ground-breaking and novel coordination network on cultural heritage research and innovation policies and activities, including the arts and the cultural and creative sectors.
Identify research and innovation domains with European added value that would justify future activities.
Propose new ways to engage stakeholders, users of cultural heritage and the arts, social innovators, civil society and, in particular, the younger generation with cultural heritage and its role in shaping the perception of European societies as well as a European sense of belonging.
Develop an open approach to cultural heritage and the arts, fostering curiosity for new developments and diversity, as well as emphasising their role in transmitting of knowledge and building a bridge from the past over the present to the future.
Scope:
The European Union has provided funding through co-funding schemes to coordinate national R&I activities on cultural heritage and the arts and to increase their impact. Through ERA-Net Co-funding Joint Research Programmes, H2020 has been topping-up Member States’ national funding to promote the coordination of national activities and strengthen their European added value. With the end of H2020, the impact of these co-funding schemes needs to be assessed in order to agree to further coordination and partnerships with Member States and Associated Countries in the new Horizon Europe research and innovation framework programme.
Proposals under this topic are expected to realise a mapping of national activities pertaining to cultural heritage, provenance research, architecture, as well as programmes and European ERA-Net Co-funding schemes on cultural heritage R&I. Furthermore, they should evaluate the European added value, any possible overlap with central EU activities, as well as the impact of and gaps left by ERA-Net Co-funding schemes in the field of cultural heritage. Taking stock of the lessons learnt, they should explore and identify objectives for a future, ground-breaking and wide network that would increase the impact of national funding at European level. Proposals should also provide analysis as well as policy scenarios for future EU-level interventions in this area, including on the role and participation of cultural and creative sectors. Need for new technologies with a specific reference to Earth Observation (Copernicus) data and products relevant for cultural heritage might be also considered. Proposals should provide a novel approach, involve the EU Member States and be open towards Associated and Neighbourhood Countries, a wide variety of stakeholders, civil society and young people.

Projects should contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:
Enhance EU migration governance by providing a rigorous review of estimates on irregular migrants living in the EU, including those working.
Enhance statistics and data on migration by developing methodologies to estimate the number of irregular migrants across different EU legislative and statistical contexts.
Assess viability, costs and economic, socio-demographic and health benefits of regularisation programs, including consideration for their possible signalling effect to incentivise further migration. Propose EU and context specific policy measures accordingly, in articulation with the general EU migration management framework.
Scope:
Irregular migrants are, by definition, difficult to capture in population statistics. As such, it remains unknown how many irregular migrants are in the EU and in the various EU Member States today. This is a challenge, given that policymakers have limited capacity to develop policies targeted to a group of people that is ill-defined. This is even more challenging in situations such as the Covid-19 pandemic, given the difficulties in accounting for a sizeable part of population ‘in the shadows’.
Proposals should comparatively assess legal frameworks across the EU that determine the irregular status of migrants (also considering the issue of ‘tolerated status’), and comprehensively assess their impact. Proposals should also evaluate this against existing statistics, analysing who is counted as regular, who as irregular and consequent discrepancies in datasets across Europe resulting from different methodologies and policy frameworks. Thereby, proposals should determine effective methodologies to address such issues. To the extent possible, they should also use available datasets to estimate number of irregular migrants residing in Member States. Project proposals should focus on at least 10 EU countries with a geographical balance across the EU. Proposals are encouraged to account for the sustainability of the project building a pan-European network with the potential to sustain and update estimates through time.
Proposals should also build a network of stakeholders from different national contexts, including, but not limited to, researchers, policymakers (from both EU institutions and Member States), civil society and employers. This network should develop an overview and review of existing knowledge on regularisation schemes for irregular migrants, presenting policy suggestions by identifying what works and what does not. In doing so, it should identify what financial and political costs are associated with the options suggested, considering the relation of this policy with the broader migration management framework.

Projects should contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:
Analyse the main drivers of inequality trends, considering both inequality of opportunities and inequality of outcomes in terms of conditions of life, economic resources and health, analyse the interplay between inequalities in different spheres of life, and identify policy factors for tackling them.
Identify and analyse different drivers of inequalities at the local, regional, national and supranational level and identify the governance levels best placed to act.
Produce research evidence, guidance and recommendations for policy-makers, social partners, firms and stakeholders to tackle unsustainable trends and reverse inequalities.
Understand key drivers of increasing territorial inequalities and identify policy factors at different governance levels for tackling urban and rural decline.
Understand how people perceive these inequalities (depending on culture, age, gender, etc.)
Scope:
In the light of increasing economic and social inequalities and regional disparities in terms of both economic and other outcomes and opportunities, research should analyse the main reasons for the increasing inequalities reported in the last decades worldwide and, thereby, identify whether this is primarily policy driven and/or the result of different factors related to globalisation and technological innovations. More specifically, research should examine whether inequality dynamics are determined by different trends:
pre-market processes including the transfer of inequalities and resources across generations (the role of cultural capital, unequal familial and background factors, paying special attention to single-parent families with dependent children; unequal access to education and training of adequate quality and content at all levels, including early childhood education and care, digital skills training or to employment counselling)
in-market processes (labour market dynamics and institutions including employment contracts and working conditions, capital and goods market structure; increasing relevance of superstar firms; globalized value chains, allocation of labour on a global scale, diffusion of innovation across firms)
post-market processes (tax-benefit policies)
other processes (public policies, tax evasion, discrimination, digital inequality, institutionalised racism, gender gap, effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, climate change, etc.)
the dynamic interplay between different forms of inequalities across different spheres and stages of life.
Research should also identify means to attenuate the trends of increasing inequalities. Part of the reasons for the rising inequalities may come from suboptimal labour market dynamics. Research should therefore also analyse the main features and institutional set up determining effective and well-performing labour markets, also with the view to help accelerating labour market and economic convergence within Member States and across EU Member States.
Research should consider and advise on how current social, cultural, and economic transformations should be best steered, so that they are fair and socially just, and do not further increase existing inequalities or create new ones. Research should include a focus on territorial inequalities and the loss of economic weight of the middle-class and on the COVID-19 economic crisis, with its unequal distributional effects for those suffering the most. Local and regional levels seem to gain momentum, but comparative research is needed in order to understand the roles of local and regional stakeholders in the struggle with inequalities. Almost everywhere in the European Union, territorial inequalities are producing what has been recently labelled as “left-behind places” in which “mainstream” development policies fail to reverse the trends of increasing inequalities. It is therefore important to compare the capacity of local stakeholders in such declining urban and rural territories to implement innovative redevelopment policies based on a better understanding of the local assets of “left-behind places”. Finally, research may assess how the digitalisation of societies (and in particular the public sector) can contribute to reducing inequalities (e.g. reducing digital skills gap, engaging vulnerable groups in the policymaking process, more inclusive digital public services policies).

Analyse and recommend possible policy approaches to address underachievement, evaluate successful and less successful policies and practices based on scientific research and evidence, as well as mobilise stakeholders to design innovative policy solutions, which can be scalable and replicable by other projects and stakeholders.
Understand, explain and tackle better the challenge of underachievement in relation to school dropout mentioned above, i.e. in the context of early tracking policies, while focusing in particular on students belonging to vulnerable populations most affected by dropout (socio-economically disadvantaged groups, Roma, migrants, refugees, etc.).
Explore good practices in school guidance, orientation and tutorial actions in current educational contexts, addressing low-achievement in basic skills as well as tackling early school leaving, in order to support educational stakeholders and foster school inclusiveness.
Scope:
Proposals should concentrate on the institutional, socio-economic, cognitive, cultural, linguistic gender, psycho-emotional and well-being determinants, as well as the root causes of underachievement and school dropout at primary, secondary and post-secondary levels of education. They should adopt a general life-long learning (LLL) approach, in which the development of the key competence of learning to learn is crucial. Proposals should take into account inequalities and the educational actions to overcome them. In addition, the action should examine the causes of underachievement related with the availability and quality of early childhood education and care (ECEC). This should enable the formulation of novel policy measures and targeted actions aimed at reducing the compounded impact of underachievement and school dropout on socio-economic fairness and inter-generational mobility in Europe. The action could also consider experimental research in order to better test the tools, the methods and the organisation of education by involving social and civil society actors, as well as relevant stakeholders.
The proposals should develop a specific diagnosis and targeted methodologies for combatting persistent low levels and negative trends in learning outcomes in Europe, by devising strategies and policy recommendations to improve social inclusion, learning and cognitive skills. The action should focus on student proficiency in reading, mathematics and science, while also taking into account the importance of supporting and reinforcing the development of other key competences and basic skills. It should look equally at the effects of tracking between different educational pathways and the impact on different target groups, especially vulnerable and marginalised communities. The action should provide a comparative assessment of existing policies targeting the achievement gap. Proposals should focus especially on the socio-economic background of multi-disadvantaged learners and their educational outcomes, as well as on the issue of persons not in education, employment or training (NEETs).

Better understand the labour market impacts of the arising new forms of work on the European welfare systems, cast against a background of demographic changes, globalisation, digitalisation and a green transition.
Propose policy measures for adapting welfare systems to improve their contribution to reducing socio-economic inequalities and poverty, to protecting people from various forms of hardship and to providing the possibility for atypical workers and the self-employed to transition towards more stable work relationships if desired, while acting as an important catalyst for economic prosperity.
Draw lessons from recent policy interventions in a contextual manner and propose adjustment measures.
Scope:
Welfare states play an integral role in reducing socio-economic inequalities and lifelong consequences of growing up in poverty, as well as in protecting people from various forms of hardship (such as unemployment and ill health) and in providing the possibility for atypical workers and the self-employed to shift towards more stable work relationships, if desired. They are also an important catalyst for economic prosperity. On the medium term however, Europe is expected to face intense demographic changes coupled with a decarbonisation of its economy, globalisation and digitalisation, all of which affect the labour market and related welfare state. At the same time, new forms of work arise, and these risk creating jobs that contribute less to and are less protected by the welfare state.
Innovative research that investigates and provides new understanding about the impact of such changes on the European labour market and related welfare systems is therefore needed, to ensure that welfare systems adapt accordingly and continue to fulfil the above mentioned roles.
Research activities may focus on the interaction between welfare policies and labour market aspects of demographic change (such as ageing, changes in household patterns, evolution of gender roles, etc.). They may alternatively concentrate on the interaction between welfare policies and labour market aspects of globalisation (such as trade liberalisation, immigration, tax competition, etc.), of digitalisation or of the green transition (such as task automation, increased career heterogeneity, job transitioning, work-home balance, need for reskilling, upskilling and lifelong learning, etc.). For example, proposals may consider the impact of an ageing population on public revenues and expenditure, while exploring alternative tax structures, tax bases and revenue sources to be implemented in an increasingly globalised economy. Proposals may otherwise investigate the impact of precariousness, unemployment and increasing job transitions on the psychosocial work environment, on social security systems, economic competitiveness and the overall mental health and wellbeing of concerned individuals, including children and youth. Furthermore, they may explore the ways in which market access and digitalisation should be shaped to enable transitions into decent work and increased socio-economic security and the role of welfare on stimulating entrepreneurship and risk-taking.
Where relevant, activities should build upon existing research, draw lessons from recent policy interventions in a contextual and transdisciplinary manner and propose adjustment measures, or test them through social innovation experiments.

Projects’ results are expected to contribute to some or all of the following outcomes:
Improved prevention, detection and investigation of domestic violence and sexual assaults, including collection of court-proof crime evidence, which take into account European multicultural dimension, legal and ethical rules of operation, as well as fundamental rights such as privacy, protection of personal data and anonymity of victims;
Enriched European common approaches applied by Police Authorities to fight domestic and sexual violence relying on the synergy of technology, the latest socio-psychological knowledge learned from cases and the field experience of Police Authorities and entities dealing with victims;
Novel, safe, lawful and efficient solutions applied by security practitioners and policy-makers to protect victims of domestic or sexual violence, along with a proper assessment methodology to validate the approach;
Increased awareness of citizens regarding domestic and sexual violence;
Improved support in shaping and tuning of regulation on domestic violence and on sexual violence by security policy-makers, which also includes GDPR-compliant IT tools in the procedures;
Increased use, by victims, of automated, interactive tools (e.g., chatbots) to report cases of domestic abuse and/or sexual violence to the police;
Improved skills, tools and training curricula for Police Authorities and Civil Society Organisations to prevent and combat domestic and sexual violence;
Identification and development of new concepts, innovative approaches and pioneering practices pertaining to alternatives to imprisonment for offenders to reduce recidivism and, therefore, support the fight against crime.
Scope:
Domestic violence keeps on being a persistent crime throughout Europe. However, the ratio of cases that are effectively reported to Police Authorities is very low. One of the causes of this lack of reporting is the limited protection offered to victims, fear, reluctance of neighbours to intervene by informing the Police Authorities, lack of awareness whom to turn to, which mechanisms exist, etc. In addition to domestic violence, women are also exposed to the threat of sexual abuse and aggression in many situations off-home. Moreover, the increase of cases of multiple abuse by groups of offenders that record their crimes using mobile devices and then share them by phone or online is a growing concern with a high social impact. Furthermore, rates of domestic and sexual violence rise when societies are under stress, during, e.g., food shortages, economic crisis, natural disasters, and epidemics.
The COVID-19 lockdown showed that in such a crisis situation the problem of domestic violence gets even more emphasised, both because victims are trapped in their homes with violent partners who are even more stressed than usually, and because the ability of services to help becomes even more limited. Similarly, women who are displaced, refugees, and living in affected areas are particularly vulnerable and exposed to sexual violence; the closure of establishments offering legal sex work because of e.g., epidemics, brings further dangers.
Needs from innovation, to be performed in a lawful and ethical manner while protecting fundamental rights, such as privacy and protection of personal data, are as follows. Firstly, building on the previous works (such as the H2020 project IMPRODOVA[1] or projects funded under the Rights, Equality and Citizenship Programme[2]), there is a need to improve current European approaches to fight domestic and sexual violence (prevent, locate, report and collect evidence) using innovative technological solutions, such as by enriching existing risk analysis tools with real-time data obtained through technological means, that will reduce both the amount of human resources to be committed and the response time.
Furthermore, victims of domestic abuse as well as of sexual violence are often reluctant to contact the police personnel and prefer to speak to chatbots, one of the main reasons being the fear of being judged. Thus, there is a clear need for innovation regarding further developments and improvements of automated, interactive tools such as chatbots that would help and stimulate victims to report cases of domestic abuse and/or sexual violence to the police.
In addition, specifically related to the cases of multiple abuse by groups of offenders that share their crimes through mobile devices or via social media, activities are needed to develop innovative technological solutions aimed at finding the source of these videos, identifying offenders, and finding victims.
Moreover, modern and effective awareness raising campaigns need to be developed for Police Authorities and relevant Civil Society Organisations to pass key messages to potential victims, as well as wide communities, while taking into account European multicultural dimension.
Last but not the least, modern and novel approaches are needed to support victim assistance services of Police Authorities and relevant Civil Society Organisations in providing efficient protection and help to victims. As both technological and societal developments are expected, the consortia should consist in IT specialists, Police Authorities, relevant Civil Society Organisations, sociologists, social workers and psychologists. If possible, taking into account their right to anonymity, their dignity and rights, victims could be involved as well, through relevant Civil Society Organisations that have the safeguards in place to protect them.
Evolutions in domestic and sexual violence, such as their increase during any type of emergency, e.g., epidemics, should be taken into account too. Methods for evaluating proposed solutions should be developed as well. All developed solutions should be accompanied by corresponding training curricula for Police Authorities and relevant Civil Society Organisations.
Proposals are expected to address one of the following options:
Option A: Domestic violence
Option B: Sexual violence
Coordination of the successful proposals from the two options is encouraged so as to avoid duplication and to exploit complementarities as well as opportunities for increased impact.
Social innovation is recommended when the solution is at the socio-technical interface and requires social change, new social practices, social ownership or market uptake. This topic requires the effective contribution of SSH disciplines and the involvement of SSH experts, institutions as well as the inclusion of relevant SSH expertise, in order to produce meaningful and significant effects enhancing the societal impact of the related research activities.
The testing and/or piloting of the tools and solutions developed in a real setting with one or more Police Authorities and other relevant authorities is an asset; regardless, applicants should plan to facilitate the uptake, replication across setting and up-scaling of the capabilities - i.e. solutions, tools, processes et al. – to be developed by the project.

Activities are expected to achieve TRL 6-7 by the end of the project – see General Annex B.

Projects’ results are expected to contribute to all of the following outcomes:
Improved vulnerability assessments by law enforcement and local managers of public spaces with a specific focus on countering and/ or preventing terrorist attacks or other forms of severe violence (amok, mass-riots), including attacks with explosives, improvised weapons and vehicles;
Better identification of specific vulnerabilities and elaboration of mitigation strategies by security practitioners and policy-makers due to the possibility to simulate attack-scenarios in any public space in realistic conditions and to test and train different prevention and response measures;
Improved training of Police Authorities in collaboration with different public and private actors (e. g., crisis management and civil protection authorities, fire brigades, regulatory agencies, emergency health services, security managers, private security organisations, civil society groups etc.) to enhance their preparedness to attacks on public spaces;
Enhanced planning capabilities of security practitioners and policy-makers due to the identification of potential vulnerabilities connected to the design/refurbishment and construction/improvement of different public spaces and measures to reduce them by implementing a comprehensive security-by-design approach in urban planning (also including aspects of social inclusion);
Enhanced modelling capabilities of security practitioners, policy-makers and research institutions due to the identification of potential vulnerabilities connected to the different public spaces, analysis of crowd behaviour and possible emergence of various threats to security in order to minimise possible threats and vulnerabilities and supporting planning of respective resources and activities.
Scope:
Public spaces such as squares, sport venues, shopping districts, places of worship or touristic attractions have been the target of numerous terrorist and other violent attacks causing significant loss of lives and causing societal insecurity as well as economic losses. The means to carry out such attacks from one or several attackers range from sophisticated and well-planned scenarios including several attackers using explosives and firearms, up to so called low-cost attacks making use of everyday goods such as cars, axes and kitchen knives. Such attacks have proven to be very difficult to prevent and quick-reaction and preparedness to respond are the crucial elements in reducing their impact.
The EU and its Member States have reacted to this challenge in the framework of the Action plan to support the protection of public spaces and the respective staff working document ""Good practices to support the protection of public spaces""[1]. Vulnerability Assessments (VA) are an established tool for example in the area of the protection of critical infrastructures. Their aim is to identify the inherent vulnerabilities of a specific target and thus to be able to put in place appropriate mitigation measures. Such assessments are used in public spaces already by Police Authorities in case of large-scale events, official visits or as part of forward-looking city planning activities. The impact on the quality and openness of public spaces should however be minimised as much as possible. This topic requires the effective contribution of SSH disciplines and the involvement of SSH experts, institutions as well as the inclusion of relevant SSH expertise, in order to produce meaningful and significant effects enhancing the societal impact of the related research activities. The full involvement of citizens and civil society organisations is crucial to achieve solutions that meet the requirement of having a balanced approach between security and openness of public spaces. Fundamental rights (including privacy) aspects should also be taken into account.
What is missing so far is a capability for security managers (public security authorities and/or private security organisations) and local authorities to conduct VA with the help of most advanced technological means. Tools for large-scale urban VA should be able to simulate realistic scenarios in any public space of different urban areas and give the users the possibility to test different prevention and response measures. They should further give the possibility for cooperation of the main public and private actors (e. g., crisis management and civil protection authorities, fire brigades, regulatory agencies, emergency health services, private security managers, etc.), and the development of tailor-made trainings. Continuing updates of the tools with the data of new urban areas, new modes of attacks and different scenarios would ensure that such capability is of long-term use and able to adapt to new developments. For that reason, it is encouraged to use the expertise and the community of the Joint Research Centre to disseminate the developed VA solutions to the stakeholders and to adapt it for long-term use. The Joint Research Centre might also support with its simulation capabilities concerning blast and vehicle ramming. At the same time, such platforms could provide support in planning processes of public spaces in case of new constructions, or re-design in order to avoid creating vulnerabilities and supporting a security-by-design approach[2], similar to what exist already for safety.
Responsible Research and Innovation[3] could be a relevant approach for the involvement of diverse stakeholders, launching debates, and co-developing or even implementing solutions.
In this topic the integration of the gender dimension (sex and gender analysis) in research and innovation content should be addressed only if the consortium deems it relevant in relation to the objectives of the research effort.

Projects’ results are expected to contribute to some or all of the following outcomes:
Increased understanding of security practitioners and policy-makers of the prevalence and of the process leading to child sexual abuse and child sexual exploitation;
Enhanced understanding of the characteristics and key differences between offending and non-offending Minor Attracted Persons;
Innovative and effective solutions, including training curricula, are validated and adopted by European Police Authorities and relevant Civil Society Organisations to prevent, detect and effectively act on child sexual exploitation, both offline and online, by providing necessary assistance to potential offenders, as well as by providing adequate preventative campaigns to reach vulnerable groups;
Developed cross-culturally validated risk assessment tools for child sexual offenders; Enhanced perception by the citizens that Europe is an area of freedom, justice and security thanks to increased security of children;
Improved cooperation between European Police Authorities and relevant Civil Society Organisations in preventing this form of crime, taking into account fundamental rights;
Improved evidence-based policy-making related to the prevention of child sexual exploitation.
Scope:
Child Sexual Exploitation (CSE), including the increasing amount of child sexual abuse material (CSAM) detected online as well as the online solicitation of children for sexual purposes, remains a serious threat. During the first wave of the global pandemic of COVID-19, there was an increased online activity in dedicated forums by offenders exploiting opportunities to engage with children who were more vulnerable due to isolation, greater online exposure and less supervision. This further highlighted the importance of CSE prevention, early detection and effective actions, both online and offline. Research is needed to better understand the process leading to offending in all its various forms (e.g. from watching CSAM to sexually abusing a child), i.e. what triggers the behaviour of potential offenders, which approaches in addressing their behaviour work and which not, which profiles of offenders can be generated, etc.
Research is also needed to provide a deeper understanding of the prevalence of these crimes as well as the prevalence of persons with a sexual interest in children. Early or weak signals should be further researched in combination with effective countermeasures and interventions. The solutions should be accompanied by corresponding training curricula for Police Authorities and Civil Society Organisations when necessary (e.g. when they involve providing assistance to potential offenders or victims). Methods for evaluating proposed solutions should be developed as well. Special care needs to be given to ethics and fundamental rights protection throughout the research and the solutions proposed. The evolving character of the CSE modus operandi should be taken into account in all activities proposed under this topic. The societal dimension should be in the core of proposed activities. In addition to the mandatory involvement of Police Authorities, the involvement of other relevant practitioners in the consortia - e.g. from Civil Society Organisations, health professionals (psychologists, psychiatrics…), forensic psychologists, criminologists and sociologists - is strongly encouraged as well. As such, this topic requires the effective contribution of SSH disciplines and the involvement of SSH experts, institutions as well as the inclusion of relevant SSH expertise, in order to produce meaningful and significant effects enhancing the societal impact of the related research activities. The testing and/or piloting of the tools and solutions developed in a real setting with one or more Police Authorities and other relevant authorities is an asset; regardless, actions should foresee how they will facilitate the uptake, replication across setting and up-scaling of the capabilities - i.e. solutions, tools, processes et al. – to be developed by the project.

Projects’ results are expected to contribute to some or all of the following outcomes:
Robust research methodologies, improved intelligence picture and understanding of mechanisms behind organised crime activities related to trafficking of cultural goods both offline and online, modus operandi, possible nexus with terrorist financing;
Enhanced ability of security practitioners to identify organised crime networks involved in trafficking in cultural goods and to detect their illicit business models, including financial aspects and money laundering activities in this sector;
Enhanced ability of security practitioners to detect and prevent the emergence of organised crime networks involved in trafficking in cultural goods, and to respond to the threat of existing organisations;
Improved and validated tools, skills and training materials (including the lawful court-proof collection of crime evidence) for European Police Authorities, Border Guards and Customs Authorities to tackle criminal activities related to trafficking of cultural goods;
Improved cooperation between European Police Authorities, Border Guards and Customs Authorities, as well as with specialised researchers and international actors, in tackling this form of crime;
Improved databases on stolen/trafficked cultural goods;
Improved evidence-based policy-making against trafficking in cultural goods.
Scope:
Trafficking in cultural goods has become one of the most profitable criminal activities for organised crime groups and the booming art and antiquity market is creating new business models for organised crime. At the same time, the art and antiquity market is also one of the least regulated markets in Europe, characterised by a lack of traceability and speculative pricing of the objects, rendering it an ideal place also for money laundering, tax evasion, etc.
Building on the results of recently completed projects, the nexus between terrorism and serious and organised crime (including cyber) deserves to be analysed further. The involvement in serious and organised crime may as well allow terrorists to generate funds to finance terrorism-related activities, as it is the case in trafficking of cultural goods. ""Blood antiquities"" are, unfortunately, nothing new. Works of art and archaeological goods/finds are looted in war zones as well as in regions not experiencing conflict, and then sold to wealthy collectors and antiquities dealers in Europe. Research has shown that crimes related to cultural goods may be conducted by organised crime groups in order to generate profit or to launder illegally acquired funds. Despite the seriousness of this issue, fundamental questions remain: How are these precious items secretly transported and what facilitates their illicit movement? What are the relations with other types of crime? How much does the trafficking of cultural goods bring in? What is the role and extension of online markets and social networks in supporting trafficking (e.g., discussion groups where looters and intermediaries exchange tips and tricks to circumvent police checks)? How can a stolen work be identified? How should the information be stored in accessible databases? What are reliable and ethical ways to gather and share information about this type of crime? What is the relationship between organised crime and the open market for cultural goods (the “grey” market)? What roles do museums and other cultural institutions (unwittingly) play in this trade? And - who defines what is an antiquity and to whom it should belong? Evidence-based research is needed to answer these questions, and to support the development of targeted and effective anti-trafficking policy.
The proposals in this topic should shed a light on these issues through robust research methodologies that prioritise new data collection and analysis, and applications towards the development of evidence-based policy. Proposals should support the gathering of intelligence and the development of tools that Police Authorities and other relevant practitioners need to fight this crime and to collect actionable (cross-border) evidence acceptable in court, with the ultimate goal of disrupting the illicit trade and of mitigating its harmful effects in Europe and beyond.
Activities proposed within this topic should address the issue from various angles, combining both social research with technological development and applications in a logical manner. Therefore, this topic requires the effective contribution of SSH disciplines and the involvement of SSH experts, institutions as well as the inclusion of relevant SSH expertise, in order to produce meaningful and significant effects enhancing the societal impact of the related research activities. Proposals should also include research into the international dimensions of the trafficking of cultural goods, as well an as investigation of the possible connections between this and other forms of crime. Due to the specific scope of this topic, in order to achieve the expected outcomes, international cooperation is encouraged. Police Authorities, Border Guards Authorities and Customs Authorities should be involved in the consortia, in order to tackle effectively all aspects of this crime.
Coordination with successful proposals under topic HORIZON-CL3-2021-FCT-01-09, HORIZON-CL3-2021-FCT-01-10, HORIZON-CL3-2022-FCT-01-05, HORIZON-CL3-2022-FCT-01-06 and HORIZON-CL3-2022-FCT-01-07 as well as with successful proposals under topic HORIZON-CL2-HERITAGE-2021-01-08 (Preserving and enhancing cultural heritage with advanced digital technologies) should be envisaged so as to avoid duplication and to exploit complementarities as well as opportunities for increased impact. Proposed research that could also link with security research for border management (for example, border checks) would be an asset. If relevant, the proposed activities should attempt to complement the objectives and activities of the EU Policy Cycle (EMPACT) – Priority Organised Property Crime. If applicable and relevant, coordination with related activities in the Digital Europe Programme should be exploited too.

Projects’ results are expected to contribute to some or all of the following outcomes:
European Police Authorities, other relevant practitioners and (social) media organisations are provided with better, modern and validated tools and training materials to tackle those activities related to disinformation and fake news that are considered as crime or could lead to a crime and that are supported by advanced digital technologies;
European common approaches are made available to policy-makers and security practitioners for analysing risks/threats, and identifying and deploying relevant security measures related to disinformation and fake news, which take into account legal and ethical rules of operation, cost-benefit considerations, as well as fundamental rights such as privacy and protection of personal data;
Improved understanding of the cultural and societal aspects of disinformation and fake news, as well as on the key challenges related to combating it;
Strengthened key personnel's knowledge regarding disinformation campaigns;
Enhanced perception of security thanks to an increased awareness of the citizens about the value of verified and trustworthy data sources and their content, obtained through education and training materials on trustable sources of information.
Scope:
Combating disinformation and fake news with implications for security is an important aspect where modern information analysis is needed. Bots are increasingly used to manipulate the public opinion and spread fake news on the internet. Causing a mass panic by spreading fake news is one example. Dimensions of this problem increase even more in crisis situations, such as the COVID-19 lockdown, where spreading disinformation and fake news, by infusing uncertainty and fear, aims at harming people’s life, intensifying the crisis situations, weakening the European societies and aggravating the divisions. This topic asks for an interdisciplinary approach based both on societal capabilities to withstand such a threat (e.g., education on trustable sources of information, research on the impact of uncertainties caused by disinformation on public crisis management and society overall) and on technological means of fighting against it. Regarding the latter, for a more effective early detection of criminal activities, Police Authorities and (social) media organisations need tools and (forensic) capabilities that, e.g., enable the assessment of the origin, veracity and trustworthiness of digital content by identifying altered or fake generated information. In the European context, this also implies that the tools should have various functionalities such as: identification of non-human originated content via origin and activity, detection of machine-generated text in various languages, verification of the authenticity of data with a high accuracy (better than human), fast analysis of large amounts of data to pre-filter for faked and/or manipulated content, which can be presented to investigators, etc. Activities proposed within this topic should build on results of previous projects on disinformation and fake news, such as those funded under Information and Communication Technologies Calls of Horizon 2020, and should address both technological and societal dimensions of fighting against disinformation and fake news in a balanced way, including also knowledge about cultural aspects and perception of disinformation (as well as trustworthiness of sources) among citizens. Thus, this topic requires the effective contribution of Social Science and Humanities (SSH) disciplines and the involvement of SSH experts, institutions as well as the inclusion of relevant SSH expertise, in order to produce meaningful and significant effects enhancing the societal impact of the related research activities.
Coordination with successful proposals from topics HORIZON-CL2-DEMOCRACY-2021-01-08 (Politics and governance in a post-pandemic world), HORIZON-CL2-DEMOCRACY-2022-01-06 (Politics and the impact of online social networks and new media) and HORIZON-CL4-2021-HUMAN-01-27 (AI to fight disinformation) should be envisaged so as to avoid duplication and to exploit complementarities as well as opportunities for increased impact.

Projects are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:
Enhanced analytical capacity to support the programming of EU-funded security research and capacity building funds through a periodic and timely evidence-based policy feedback ;
Periodically aggregated and consolidated view of the capability needs and gaps in the thematic areas under consideration[1];
Periodically aggregated and consolidated view of the state-of-the-art technologies, techniques, methods and tools that can contribute to fill the identified capability gaps;
Periodically aggregated and consolidated view of outcomes (including on technological, industrial, legal and ethical issues), future trends, lessons learnt and best practices derived from past and current security research effort incurred in the thematic areas under consideration.
More systematic assessment and validation of the outcomes of EU-funded security research projects with respect to identified capability gaps through harmonised support mechanisms;
Common and updated map of opportunities and constraints for the exploitation of EU security research and innovation projects, with special focus on industrialisation, commercialisation, adoption and deployment of innovative solutions in response to common capability gaps;
Common and updated map of areas requiring standardised solutions and/or certification schemes to foster innovation uptake and market creation, as well as trainings and options for the implementation of such schemes.
Enhanced cooperation between research institutions, smaller private research agencies, security practitioners, SMEs and community representatives to support integrated participation in requirements determination and analysis, research and validation and evaluation of results.
Scope:
Innovation uptake is not a linear process, and even less a single-step process that happens only at the end of a research project and it is not automatically enabled by a successful research result. The innovation uptake process begins with the identification of a need and ends with an innovative solution deployed on the field of operations, being R&I only one of the many contributors to the overall process, but not the first and not the last. In other words, successful results of research projects are a necessary but not sufficient condition to guarantee the uptake of innovation.
Investment in security research needs to be designed taking into consideration how and when it can deliver outcomes that contribute to the development of security capabilities. Therefore, research will be undertaken, from its very early stages, in a way that addresses real needs while guaranteeing the impact in the final solutions. It will also ensure to identify and underpin the factors that could help in the implementation of its results. However, the programming of research is highly conditioned by the quality, reliability and timeliness of the evidence that supports its decision making process. This includes the identification and understanding of the contextual elements that can or will influence or be influenced by the research (process), the research team and the research projects themselves.
The European Commission and the EU Member States carry out this programming exercise periodically, taking into account a wide variety of inputs. The complexity of the challenge is notable, considering that the EU security landscape is volatile, uncertain, complex and ambiguous in what regards the security threats, the capabilities required to face them, the evolution of modern technologies, and the skillset needed to deploy those. In order to carry out a sound programming exercise, the European Commission and the EU Member States strive to consult and involve all actors. With that aim, experts are gathered in different configurations and their inputs are coordinated at EU and national levels to be factored in by the decision-making bodies of EU-funded security research.
These experts require high quality, reliable and timely evidence to support their assessments, but information is often scattered, hardly visible and requires bespoke processing for the detection of patterns and for the generation of actionable intelligence. In other cases, it is simply not presented in the right format to unveil its value.
Applicants are invited to submit proposals for the establishment of Knowledge Networks for Security Research & Innovation. The role of these networks is to collect, aggregate, process, disseminate and exploit the existing knowledge to directly contribute to the expected outcomes of this topic.
Networks should engage with the main sources of information in order to have a sound and updated picture of the aspects mentioned above. This includes interaction with security experts (beyond the members of the project consortium), organisations, projects or initiatives, but also an extensive review of available databases, studies, reports or literature (notably all information generated under the EU-funded security research programmes, and possibly under other EU or MS funding programmes).
The networks must ensure the dissemination and exploitation of their findings to the different communities of the security research ecosystem, including policy makers, security authorities, industry, researchers and citizens. Special emphasis needs to be made on the contribution of these networks to the work of entities and initiatives established by the European Commission (e.g. Union Civil Protection Knowledge Network) and the EU Agencies to contribute to the security research programming effort In this regard, the networks should contribute timely and intensively to the work of the Thematic Working Groups of the Community of Users for Secure, Safe and Resilient Societies (future CERIS –Community of European Research and Innovation for Security) and of other equivalent innovation labs/groups set-up by EU Agencies (e.g. Frontex). The networks have to contribute to these working groups with the quantitative and qualitative evidence required to carry out their activities in support to a more impactful EU-funded Security R&I and to a more frequent and systematic innovation uptake.
Each proposal should include a plan, and a budget amounting at least 25% of the total cost of the action to carry out activities involving industry, academia and other providers of innovative solutions outside the consortium, for example with the aim to assessing the soundness of their findings, give support in validation processes, promote competitive development (e.g. via prizes) or dissemination of results, among other options.
The networks must be in a position to deliver findings on the abovementioned challenges starting from the month 6 of the project and periodically every 6 months or less, in accordance with the information needs of the entities and initiatives they are contributing to.
Proposals should clearly describe the process and timing for the collection of inputs and the generation of outcomes. This plan has to go beyond the description of project deliverables and milestones, and describe in detail how and when the findings will be disseminated and exploited during the project and in collaboration with the communities described above.
The applicants submitting the proposals have to ensure sufficient representativeness of the communities of interest (including, but not only, geographical representativeness) and a balanced coverage in terms of knowledge and skills of the different knowledge domains required to face the challenge, including security operations, technologies, research & innovation, industry, market, etc. The applying consortia need to demonstrate that the project beneficiaries guarantee the expertise required to steer the project activities in all the knowledge domains to ensure the success of the action. The work of the partners has to be supported by solid and recognised tools and methods, also accompanied by the required expertise to put them in practice.
The networks should build to the extent possible on the work initiated by the Networks of Practitioners funded under H2020 Secure Societies work programmes. Should such networks be still ongoing, maximum cooperation and minimum overlapping should be ensured and demonstrated.
Under this call, the applicants are invited to propose networks on the thematic areas of:
Option A: Border Security;
Option B: Resilient Infrastructure.
Only one network in each area can be funded.
The project should have a maximum estimated duration of 3 years.
This topic requires the effective contribution of SSH disciplines and the involvement of SSH experts, institutions as well as the inclusion of relevant SSH expertise, in order to produce meaningful and significant effects enhancing the societal impact of the related research activities.

European Police Authorities are provided with modern, innovative and validated tools and training curricula, which take into account legal and ethical rules of operation as well as fundamental rights such as privacy and protection of personal data to prevent, detect and investigate online identity theft, and lawfully collect crime evidence across borders for its use in court proceedings;
Strengthened ability of security practitioners to identify (new forms of) online identity theft at an early stage thanks to improved knowledge on the modus operandi and new trends in identity theft, including but not limited to deepfakes, and innovative solutions for Police Authorities to tackle them in lawful manner;
Improved understanding on the societal aspects and impacts of identity theft, as well as on the key challenges related to it;
Enhanced perception by the citizens that Europe is an area of freedom, justice and security thanks to innovative awareness-raising campaigns explaining to citizens the key and evolving mechanisms of identity theft and how to protect against them;
Improved shaping and implementation of regulation related to the fight against identity theft by security policy-makers.
Scope:
The “classical” form of identity theft has been a big business for years and consists in personal and financial data stolen online, sold in the underground economy and misused by criminal organisations all over the world, usually for financial gain. With the technological evolution, identity theft evolves as well. Personal details can be found by hacking computers, but identity thieves are increasingly getting citizens’ personal information from social media sites. Furthermore, an on-going improvement of technologies to create deepfake audio and video material may result in novel forms of identity theft. This relatively new but rapidly evolving technology superimposes audio, images or videos over another video or creates new ones. For instance, it can be used, among others, to generate new ""personalised"" child abuse material, to create fake social media accounts in the name of the target person (to harness or stalk them), to place the faces of celebrities on existing pornographic videos, to spread misinformation about a company (leading to financial losses) or a politician or an expert (reputational damage).
Research is needed to develop new technological means of detecting deepfakes in support of the work of Police Authorities, as it may only be a matter of time before deepfakes are used more often in online identity theft cases. In addition, this can have serious implications for Police Authorities, since it might complicate investigations and raise questions about the authenticity of evidence. The issue of collecting (cross-border) evidence for its use in courts of law, i.e. in a lawful manner and respecting fundamental rights such as privacy and protection of personal data, should be tackled in proposed activities as well. Other evolving modus operandi and new trends in online identity thefts should be analysed too, and corresponding innovative lawful societal means of preventing as well as innovative lawful technological means of detecting and investigating them should be developed. Thus, activities proposed within this topic should address both the technological and societal dimensions of online identity theft in a balanced way. An analysis of trends (who the victims of identity thefts are usually, whether gender/age/ICT skills play a role, etc.) would be an asset. Special care should be given to ethics and fundamental rights protection throughout the research and the solutions proposed.
This topic requires the effective contribution of SSH disciplines and the involvement of SSH experts, institutions as well as the inclusion of relevant SSH expertise, in order to produce meaningful and significant effects enhancing the societal impact of the related research activities. With the aim of developing effective awareness raising campaigns, involvement of relevant Civil Society Organisations, sociologists and psychologists who can shed a light on the phenomenon of identity theft from the side of victims and how to support them, would be an added value of proposals submitted under this topic. If applicable and relevant, coordination with related activities in the Digital Europe Programme should be envisaged too.

Security practitioners, the research community and policy-makers build upon existing knowledge on lessons learned and best practices, as well as recommendations and good examples of how the EU is using technology to combat risks to security while respecting and promoting fundamental rights.
Scope:
Applied research derives its meaning, and therefore, its financial justification from its relevance to society, to society’s needs, to society’s values, to its aims, needs or ambitions. Applied research presupposes that a distinct societal need is identified and that a programme of research is devised to provide the concrete knowledge required to meet that need as well as to better understand areas related to experience and requirements of technologies regarding vulnerable groups through universal design and common accessibility principles.
The finality and value of applied research is assessed on the grounds of this relevance, on the degree to which the results of the research can be applied to one or several problems beyond or after the research itself. The salience and value of any type of applied research – including security research – lies outside the research itself and in its impact on society.
In general, research can have an impact on society at two different points: at the level of the scientific methodology that employs and at the level of the scientific outputs that generates and communicates. Any action can have desirable and undesirable outcomes. Undesired results of security research can include both the results of research that does not reach its intended aims or research that does not reach its aims, but whose aims do not provide the security it originally set out to provide. Significantly, it can include particular measures that have as a secondary effect an increase in insecurity such as the development of technological solutions.
In innovation processes and advances of technological change, the societal aspect covers all those areas that influence the citizen, society and the state. This can range from privacy issues and confidentiality to the use of products and services, the potential for misuse of information and data, fake news, security marking, secure infrastructure etc.
Technological solutions in the area of civil security for society are often perceived as intrusive means to intensify and broaden surveillance and control of citizens in a top-down approach. Security technology is addressed with mistrust as regards to its detrimental effects on civil liberties and raises questions on fundamental rights and freedoms, privacy and data protection. Nevertheless, a wide variety of technological tools is available in different languages for different risk scenarios and with different functionalities. At the same time, technology can also be applied to increase societal resilience, improve and strengthen horizontal coordination, raise citizens’ awareness and facilitate exchange of information among citizens in crisis’ situations, disasters or pandemic risk incidents. Strengthening a co-productive use of technology to enhance societal resilience requires a better understanding of inclusive design, crowd-based, and Information and Communication Technologies (ICT)-enabling horizontal communication processes.
A systemic stock of such technologies, including an evidence-based assessment of the number of users in Europe and an evaluation of their impact in past human life disasters or crisis management incidents can help to improve the societal acceptability, directionality, desirability and ethicalness of security research and innovation. A societal development plan that examines the socio, economic, political context, which might have caused the security problems, can also help to learn from past-experiences. Demonstrating awareness of the risks that potentially build biases into automated systems would be important to identify best solutions for relevant functionalities and pave the way for a coordinated European approach, which strikes the right balance between practitioners’ technology requirements and privacy-friendly tools and solutions for the citizens. Furthermore, improved knowledge of relevant human and societal factors in order to assist, supplement or override human misjudgement, lack of compliance or understanding through education and training modules can better achieve the desired impacts on attitude and behaviour change creating resilience to security threats.
In assessing the impact of security technologies, proposals are expected to examine methodologies that allow citizens genuine participation, including the vulnerable groups and people with disabilities in innovation processes. A socio-technical approach can enhance the ambition and effectiveness of innovations by inspiring socially acceptable design for systematic change and societal transformation. They should look into methodologies that measure the impact of technologies on society by addressing issues of: what can be measured (qualitative and quantitative measurements); why it is important to measure; what is important to measure both from policy and technology aspects and how societal impact can be measured (qualitative and quantitative measurements), including evidence about cognitive biases.
Proposals should also address mitigation measures that could be taken to reduce the impact on privacy, human rights and fundamental freedoms with the involvement of citizens as co-designers and beneficiaries in security research. When assessing impact, attention should also be paid to citizens’ training for reducing negative effects, modelling and simulation of their behaviour in the event of security threats. This may include virtual assessment of different protection (prevention, preparedness and response) measures.
Proposals’ consortia should comprehend security practitioners, system developers, public sector, technology and civil society organisations[1], communication specialists on security research, researchers and Social Sciences and Humanities Experts from a variety of EU Member States and Associated Countries. In order to ensure a meaningful democratic oversight of the EU’s security research programme, projects and policies at national and European level, proposals should ensure a multidisciplinary approach and have the appropriate balance of industry, citizens’ representatives and social sciences and humanities experts.
Project proposals’ consortia are encouraged to cooperate closely with the Networks of Practitioners funded under H2020 Secure Societies work programmes if valuable results on impact can be obtained, as well as with the Knowledge Networks for Research and Innovation in Security funded under the Horizon Europe Cluster 3 Work Programme.
As indicated in the introduction of this call, proposals should foresee resources for clustering activities with other successful proposals in the same or other calls to identify synergies and best practices.
This topic requires the effective contribution of SSH disciplines and the involvement of SSH experts, institutions as well as the inclusion of relevant SSH expertise, in order to produce meaningful and significant effects enhancing the societal impact of the related research activities.
Proposals could also be linked to finished or ongoing projects such as the NewHoRRizon (under the H2020 Research and Innovation Programme) which have developed Societal Readiness Level Tools. They may also consider using their interactive web tools provided to help study the societal input and engagement as part of project proposal development and implementation.
The project should have a maximum estimated duration of 4 years.

Improving the environmental sustainability of industrial production;
Improving the agility of European industry and its resiliency to external and internal influences;
Integrating state-of-the-art AI technologies with advanced circular manufacturing and re-manufacturing technologies and systems, exploiting their potential across the entire product and service lifecycle;
Scope:
This topic focuses on manufacturing and process industries, addressing the entire lifecycle of products and services from design to remanufacturing and including all the aspects primarily relevant for industrial production. The objective is to exploit the potential of AI as a transformation tool to support circular production in the entire manufacturing and process industry, with due consideration for standardisation activities when relevant. AI will be a strategic instrument to improve sustainability, agility and resilience to external and internal influences, taking account of the European Green Deal objectives. AI applications will be capable of optimising their actions based on limited human input, thanks to context awareness and information sensed from the physical environment, and will have the long useful lifetime typical of industrial environments.
Projects have to address the need for AI tool sets with simplified interfaces requiring only easy to acquire skills, and adapted to manufacturing environments without highly skilled personnel. Methods and tools will be provided to make AI solutions usable also for lower volume production and shorter time series, guaranteeing the quality of results even while using reduced resources for the training of AI algorithms. Generative approaches could be considered to help designing products and processes improving the sustainability of industrial solutions. The topic will integrate new or existing technologies to make them practically and economically viable in the industrial world; this should be demonstrated through at least two realistic use cases with demonstrable economic return.
Proposals submitted under this topic should include a business case and exploitation strategy, as outlined in the introduction to this Destination.

Projects are expected to contribute to the following outcomes:
Establishing European industry as leader in sustainable data-driven manufacturing and process industries through efficient data processing and notably at the edge of the network, improving the environmental, economic and social sustainability of industrial production, and reinforcing European leadership in the deployment and operations of industrial network;
Improving the agility of European manufacturing industry and increase its resiliency to external shocks, including with agile, secure and easy-to-implement non-public 5G systems, leading to more resilient production processes;
Demonstrate the use of open systems and qualified open source software tools for data monitoring & collection as well as data analytics;
Foster industrial data and distributed computing standardisation;
Facilitate the development of technologies requiring only minimal training of the industrial workforce.
Scope:
Fully reaching the opportunities of sharing and exploiting industrial data, including deep industrial data[1], requires to strike the right balance between storing and handling data centrally in the cloud or locally at the edge of industrial network. Such a balance has to take into account not only efficiency but also the real-time requirements and cybersecurity aspects as well as the ability to systemically integrate and upgrade operational technology to the innovative developments in (self-) configuration, therefore building a flexible industrial Internet for distributed control and modular manufacturing while keeping the high-level of reliability and safety required by the manufacturing sector.
Computing, storage and networking technologies will have to show also flexibility along the industrial value chains and promote the introduction of new business models, based on the availability of deep industrial data from different data sources and ontologies, within an agreed data governance, with mutual trust and adequate distribution of the value created by sharing data.
Proposals are expected to address one of the following technology areas for data-driven industrial environments:
Development of technologies and definition of specifications and standards for data, products, and/or business processes, that can be agreed and commonly used by many industrial actors, and that have the potential for the emergence of future digital value chains, identify promising industrial areas and organisational models that facilitate cooperation and collaborative product and service design among industry players facilitating industry agreements.
Quick uptake of advanced 5G technologies by European manufacturing sector to support the convergence towards greater exploitation of industrial data and increase resilience and cybersecurity by design. Private 5G networks (5G NPN) are exclusive mobile networks that manufacturers can use for a defined local production site; they can be tailored to the individual needs of the manufacturer and meet future requirements in the area of Industry 4.0. Innovative approaches to simplify the deployment and operation of such private 5G networks throughout their life cycle are needed. Implementers in industrial environments need to take a holistic view, including both the connectivity infrastructure (with 5G as a central component) and the actual production system. An important element for rapid deployment is also the development and evaluation of new business models for private 5G networks. In particular, projects should offer opportunities for new players that have their main focus on non-public (campus) networks (NGN) for connected industries and in particular automation applications. Projects will aim at ""Zero-Touch Management"", using network automation, AI / ML, Self-organizing Networks (SON), etc. and taking into account the specifics of industrial environments.
Projects are encouraged to develop toolkits of open hardware, software and toolware, and qualify the use of these to provide opportunities to SMEs to further automate and digitalise their manufacturing, through, for example, OPC-UA and Administrative Shell (AAS) as well as further development on top of these Industrial Internet standards and there inherent cyber security demands for Operational Technology environment.
The distributed industrial computing environments will be demonstrated effectively in a minimum of two specific manufacturing applications. The topic will integrate new or existing technologies to make them practically and economically viable in the industrial world, and will encompass modern manufacturing technologies such as digital twins.
Proposals submitted under this topic should include a business case and exploitation strategy, as outlined in the introduction to this Destination.
Research must build on existing standards or contribute to standardisation. Interoperability for data sharing should be addressed. Additionally, a strategy for skills development should be presented, associating social partners when relevant.

Projects are expected to contribute to the following outcomes:
Deploy exemplary pilot solutions of the Industrial-Urban Symbiosis (I-US) concept, making the flows of energy, waste and water circular; and achieving near-zero GHG emissions and near-zero water discharge;
Reduce by 50% (in weight or volume) industrial waste generation and reduce significantly the associated GHG emissions, by re-using and transforming waste, by-products and side-streams into new resources or raw materials;
Plan a list of actions to overcome non-technological barriers for exploitation of cross-company symbiosis (i.e. waste regulations, standardisation, confidentiality and compliance, ownership, fair sharing of benefits, acceptance of the concept);
Set up facilitation services for helping implementation of symbiotic processes directed to local authorities, and relevant businesses, private/industry actors, especially SMEs;
Develop best practices for knowledge-sharing on technological and non-technological aspects (i.e. job profile optimisation) in close collaboration with the European Community of Practice (ECoP) CSA and other relevant bodies, dissemination the major innovation outcomes to support the implementation of I-US;
Explore and virtually demonstrate replication potential in other regions (i.e. by setting up a network amongst waste associations to optimise flow of secondary raw materials);
Implement actions to facilitate relations and to involve the local community actors (authorities, associations, civil society, relevant businesses, especially SMEs, educational organisations, etc.), e.g. exchanging knowledge and human capital with the educational establishments and developing flexible learning resources.
Implement a social innovation spin-off action[1] involving one of the local community actors.
Relevant indicators and metrics, with baseline values, should be stated clearly in the proposal.
Scope:
In March 2020, the European Commission launched the Circular Economy Action Plan for a cleaner and more competitive Europe. In order to accelerate the transition to a circular economy, exemplary pilot solutions integrating industrial urban symbiosis need to be exploited. The solutions could cover the reduction of waste, virgin raw materials and energy and water consumption, mainly by transforming underused waste materials (both industrial waste, industrial side streams, by-products and end of life urban waste) into feedstock for the process industries (urban mining). To support a wide implementation of industrial urban symbiosis for waste utilization, the regional dimension is important since connexion with local energy and utility networks, adjacent industrial infrastructures and available by-products is crucial and will have to be considered in a holistic approach.
Technology and social based innovations should prove the potential for novel symbiotic value chains in demonstrators involving multiple industrial sectors (combining non-exhaustively energy, process and manufacturing industries) in pilot industrial settings. Projects are expected to address several but not necessarily all following aspects:
A broad cross-sectorial symbiosis and circularity implementation from a regional perspective to potentially achieve climate neutrality by 2050 including cooperation with other suitable regions in terms of availability of resources, technologies, available infrastructures and knowledge transfer;
Cross-cutting solutions (processes and equipment) for the processing of side/waste streams specifically for the use as feedstock for plants and companies across sectors and/or across value chains, while increasing the resource efficiency/circularity in industrial value chains;
Process (re-)design and adaptation to integrate new processes (energy and material flow coupling, infrastructure and logistics) and create new synergies between sectors;
Integration of novel sensing technology, IoT and digital tools to support design (including AI driven tools for the discovery of hidden pathways), flow optimization and controls;
Concepts, tools and business models for the flexible and robust management of exchange streams in dynamic production environments to maximise the impact on sustainability while respecting the technical limitations, economic interests of the producers and the interests of citizens;
IT infrastructures and tools that provide a secure basis for the integrated management and the preservation of confidentiality of sensitive data;
Assessment methodologies and KPIs to measure the performance of symbiosis, including environmental, economic and social impacts (including SRL). Life cycle assessment and life cycle cost analysis should take into account existing sustainability standards (e.g. ISO 14000) and existing best practices;
Development/use (preferred) of common reporting methodologies for the assessment of industrial symbiosis activities and exchanges in close collaboration with the European Community of Practice (ECoP);
Tools to support companies in redefining their products process and systems from the point of view of design, production, logistic and business models, preferably based on the outcomes of previous projects (see for example SPIRE project portfolio on Industrial Symbiosis);
Study social aspects of the community and its improvement through the I-US where demonstration pilot is located (social innovation, underdevelopment, job quality gender and inclusiveness perspective);
Create societal awareness through a participative approach locally and more broadly, highlighting and communicating political and regulatory obstacle between regions/countries.
Proposals submitted under this topic should include a business case and exploitation strategy, as outlined in the introduction to this Destination. Interoperability for data sharing should be addressed.
Clustering and cooperation with other selected projects under this cross-cutting call and others in HE, with European initiatives (as for example: Circular Cities and Regions Initiative (CCRI) and European Circular Economy Stakeholder Panel (ECESP)), as well as building on existing projects[2] is strongly encouraged, see also Industrial Symbiosis Report from March 2020[3].

Improved construction quality and service life compliance.
Improved accuracy of energy performance assessment and any other assessment conducted in parallel, reduced gap between assessment and actual performance.
Improved and automated monitoring of energy performance of buildings, and other relevant life-cycle performance aspects with a direct link to the energy efficiency performance.
Improved user-friendliness of Energy Performance Certificates and post-occupancy performance data, in terms of clarity, accuracy, trade-offs and usability of the information provided.
Increased uptake of design standards and practices based on actual performance.
More reliable understanding of energy and environmental performance in the early stage of the building life cycle, and over service life, based on robust and consistent assessment practices across the buildings sector and across Member States and Associated Countries.
Scope:
The next generation of energy performance assessment and certification schemes needs to support the transition towards a climate neutral building stock over the full life cycle, relying on technological innovations to improve speed and quality of as-built performance assessment and service life compliance checks, also linking to other instruments such as building logbooks, building renovation roadmaps, Level(s) and other datasets. Energy performance assessment and certification schemes should seek to work coherently, where relevant, with other performance data generated over the building’s life cycle. This can include well-being, indoor air quality, noise and acoustic quality, daylight levels, pollutants and health related data, as well as data pertaining to other issues such as accessibility of buildings, and consumption of non-energy resources such as water.
The proposal should:
Develop more reliable, cost-effective and highly replicable energy performance calculation methods also addressing, in parallel, relevant life-cycle performance aspects (e.g. well-being, indoor air quality and comfort, acoustics, water consumption, resilience, or whole life carbon) with a direct link to the energy efficiency performance.
Address the definition and demonstration of advanced and innovative approaches for building energy performance and certification, and how these can interact with other relevant life cycle performance data and certification, focusing on a credible assessment of building intrinsic performance but also increasingly working towards output-based assessments using available building data; Investigate how such approaches can rely on automatic and semi-automatic assessment based on building digital models (e.g. BIM).
Seek to incorporate in those approaches social and economic indicators.
Develop dynamic energy and other relevant life-cycle performance assessment and certification databases as a unique source of information on individual buildings over their lifetime for home owners, investors, real estate agents and public authorities.
Demonstrate how data from smart sensors can be included in assessments in a dynamic way, also exploring, where relevant, how to combine building asset rating with building operational rating, and how to use digital innovations for the assessment of energy and other relevant life-cycle performance.
Ensure the proposed solutions build on the results of previous projects dealing with building performance including Energy Performance Certificates (EPCs), also considering where relevant integrating building renovation passports or roadmaps in EPCs.
Ensure the proposed solutions allow for synergies with other relevant instruments (e.g. the smart readiness indicator under Directive 2010/31/EU, building renovation passports and relevant parts of Level(s)).
Seek to ensure from the design phase that the project is developed with a view to integrate its results/deliverables under a digital building logbook.
Ensure that the proposed solutions comply with, and support a broad adoption of, relevant EU standards (e.g. Energy Performance of Buildings standards developed by CEN, CENELEC and ETSI under Mandate M/480) and codes in order to allow for an EU-wide deployment.
Ensure the involvement of relevant stakeholders (including European, national and regional certification bodies and consumer organisations).
Clustering and cooperation with other relevant projects is strongly encouraged; in particular, liaison and synergies with the Horizon Europe Partnership on ‘People-centric sustainable built environment’.

Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:
For Area A:
A well-founded understanding of effects and impacts (positive as well as negative), benefits and costs of CCAM systems and services (short, medium, long-term).
Methods and indicators to assess the impacts of CCAM solutions on mobility and wider socio-economic and environmental aspects (public health, land use/infrastructure need, accessibility, affordability, economy, employment, working conditions and required skills, energy use, air quality, carbon emissions, etc.).
Definition of KPIs incorporating societal targets with individual mobility needs.
Methods and tools for CCAM developers and manufacturers, authorities, municipalities and citizens enabling design and decision-making based on an integrated understanding of all its possible short, medium and long-term impacts, thereby avoiding negative rebound effects, such as discrimination or bias towards certain user groups, like women, the elderly, and disabled persons, but also ethnic minorities, persons from low income backgrounds, persons with varying digital literacy and skills, and those living in rural or peri-urban areas.
Input for the design and evaluation of CCAM partnership activities, in particular for the large-scale demonstrators (ex-ante and ex-post) and for public engagement activities aimed at realistically informing users of CCAM capabilities and expectations.
For Area B:
Methods and measures that capture the mobility needs of European citizens in the context of economic, social and environmental objectives at national, regional and local levels and that provide guidance on how to engage with citizens on CCAM solutions aiming to address these needs.
Robust and documented knowledge (e.g. knowledge maps) of users’ and implementers’ expectations, concerns and desires with regards to CCAM solutions for the mobility of persons and goods, with special attention to the needs of vulnerable users and under-researched groups, including women, disabled persons, and the elderly, but also ethnic minorities, persons from low income backgrounds, persons with varying digital literacy and skills, and those living in rural or peri-urban areas. This knowledge is to be integrated into the design and development of CCAM solutions to support these specific needs.
Tools that allow CCAM developers, deployers and public authorities to implement user-centred CCAM solutions that effectively contribute to societal targets, including equity, and the uptake of CCAM systems at regional level.
Recommendations for large-scale demonstration projects to include user and societal aspects taking into account location-specific characteristics of the implementation area, such as local policy targets, population density, and cultural matters.
All the above expected outcomes should support the uptake of CCAM solutions (including acceptance and adoption).
Scope:
With the increasing digitalisation of road transport, CCAM solutions have the potential to deliver an improved quality of life, by increasing safety and providing more sustainable and inclusive mobility solutions. However, for these solutions to be successful, a comprehensive understanding of all effects of CCAM on individuals, society and the environment over time is needed. Moreover, the successful deployment of CCAM solutions will depend on their availability and accessibility to future users, including the deploying organisations, as well as on the willingness of the general public to use and accept future CCAM solutions.
This topic requires the effective contribution of SSH disciplines and the involvement of SSH experts, institutions, as well as the inclusion of relevant SSH expertise, in order to produce meaningful and significant effects enhancing the societal impact of the related research activities.To make sure that the proposed actions reflect the realities of a society with changing mobility, digital and environmental needs, participatory processes with a wide and diverse range of future user groups, civil society organisations, citizens, experts, deployers and decision makers at various levels are strongly encouraged. The resulting methods and tools should therefore be designed and developed in a co-creation manner between authorities, municipalities and citizens, as well as CCAM developers and manufacturers. To this end, it is recommended to develop solutions that are grounded in social innovation.
Actions must address the activities either under area A) Analysis of socio-economic and environmental impacts of CCAM systems and services OR under area B) Assessment of societal, citizen and user aspects for needs-based CCAM solution development and deployment.
Area A: Analysis of socio-economic and environmental impacts of CCAM systems and services
The analysis of CCAM benefits and risks are, or have been, addressed in R&I projects, which has resulted in the creation of several impact assessment frameworks and decision support tools. However, these are not sufficiently comprehensive and lack a higher-level systems approach to fully understand and assess the short, medium and long-term risks of CCAM solutions on societal and environmental aspects. The maturity level of existing assessment tools varies: the analysis of accident risk of automated vehicles has been considered extensively, while the understanding of wider health and equity effects on users’ mobility experience is much less developed.
Actions will enhance existing methods/frameworks or develop new, broader, more comprehensive and inclusive methods for the assessment of how CCAM solutions, systems and services impact mobility and wider socio-economic and environmental aspects to ensure that the design of CCAM solutions are tailored to evolving mobility and environmental needs.
The proposed actions should include all the following aspects:
Develop comprehensive impact assessment methods that cover the full range of effects of CCAM systems and services by taking a systems perspective that includes e.g. effects on jobs, health, inclusiveness, affordability and access to essential services, environment.
For these methods, existing KPIs should be reviewed and updated if needed. In addition, new KPIs need to be developed, to capture aspects like equity in terms of access to mobility, or sustainability. User expectations towards e.g. comfort, perceived safety, necessary digital skills and access to information should also be addressed with qualitative assessments (e.g. observations, surveys, interviews).
Ensure practical usefulness of these methods by addressing regional specifics within Europe, as well as the evolving needs and dynamics of a society in transition towards more sustainable and shared mobility for both people and goods.
Cover under-researched fields in terms of impact assessment of CCAM solutions, such as the inclusion of underserviced or socio-economically challenged geographical areas and specific population groups.
Area B: Assessment of societal, citizen and user aspects for needs-based CCAM solution development and deployment
The assessment of societal, citizen and user aspects of CCAM has been addressed in a number of Horizon 2020 projects[1], typically focusing on the acceptance of automated vehicles by drivers and the public, driver needs and trust, and ways to increase driver performance. Yet the assessment of CCAM solutions in terms of inclusiveness, equity and accessibility is lacking in most R&I projects, and rarely goes beyond considering gender, disability and age. While these categories need sustained attention, persons with different income levels, different digital experiences, literacy and access, as well as people living in rural or peri-urban areas, are examples of user groups that also need to be included in these assessment criteria so that extensive analyses of user needs and expectations can be carried out.
The aim is to proactively consider all user groups and societal objectives in the design and development phases of CCAM solutions.
The proposed actions should include all the following aspects:
Develop and apply a systems approach for better understanding and considering user and societal needs, desires and expectations related to CCAM solutions, systems and services. A broad understanding of “users” is to be applied, including persons, public institutions such as hospitals and schools, organisations and businesses.
Analyse equity aspects related to the deployment of CCAM solutions in terms of e.g. income level and solutions for deprived or underserviced areas, digital access and access to essential services, covering personal mobility as well as provision of supplies and necessities to end users.
Map the broad range of concerns and expectations concerning CCAM involving a variety of stakeholders (including citizens, communities, transport service providers, professional drivers, road transport operators, road authorities, vehicle and other industry) and disciplines, including SSH (social sciences and humanities) to invest in social innovation that can complement the deployment of needs-based CCAM solutions.
Define methodologies and mechanisms to communicate with future users/ citizens about CCAM aspects related to trust, ethics and acceptance.
Develop tools that foster capacity building on CCAM among planners and decision makers to enhance their ability to influence solution design and development.
Provide guidance on how to align overarching long-term policy goals and societal ambitions with user needs.
In order to achieve the expected outcomes, international cooperation is advised for all projects of topic (addressing either area A or area B), in particular with projects or partners from the US, Japan, Canada, South Korea, Singapore, Australia.

Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:
Common methodologies and tools for the safety validation of CCAM systems defined, accepted and validated
by the CCAM value chain and its R&I partners for the efficient verification of CCAM systems in their R&I and product development processes;
by authorities and certification bodies for the validation of CCAM systems within type approval schemes and in future exemption procedures;
and by consumer testing campaigns for the safety rating of automated vehicles assisting users in identifying the safest choices for their needs.
Verification, validation and rating procedures based on realistic and relevant test cases generated from an openly accessible European database, compliant with the FAIR data principles[1], providing the widest possible range of relevant scenarios, which CCAM systems will potentially encounter on European roads as a basis for robust system design.
Scope:
A decisive factor for the successful implementation of innovative CCAM technologies and for their acceptance and adoption in society will be assuring the effective safety of CCAM systems.
While different assessment methods for automated driving functions have been developed, common standard methodologies meeting all the requirements for testing, validation and certification of all levels and use cases of automated driving do not yet exist. Therefore, consensus building between all stakeholders is urgently needed to establish common, validated methodologies and tools. Existing approaches are currently analysed in Horizon 2020, an experts’ network has been set up and validation concepts are demonstrated for selected use cases e.g. in the HEADSTART project[2].
Proposed actions should move the development of common verification and validation methodologies to a new level by widening substantially the scope of use cases addressed and by preparing the required tools to enable the comprehensive safety verification and validation of CCAM systems. This should take into account mixed traffic situations and include functional safety issues and cybersecurity. Such methodologies and tools should allow for their further development and adaptation with future technological evolution. Scenario-based approaches combining virtual and physical testing are needed, as conventional verification and validation approaches would require hundreds of millions of test kilometres for higher levels of CCAM.
Proposed actions are expected to develop a commonly accepted and harmonised simulation environment with standardised, open interfaces and quality controlled data exchange to enable the virtual testing of CCAM functions and systems in a multitude of relevant test cases and to enable the efficient and seamless use of validated models from different sources.
The validation of CCAM systems depends on the definition of relevant safety-critical scenarios and test cases. Several national and European projects have started to collect such scenarios and store them in databases. There is, however, no European database of relevant scenarios nor an agreed database structure. Scenario descriptions also need to be harmonised and not all relevant scenarios are known. Therefore, proposals need to define and develop processes and tools to continuously identify relevant events and convert them into detailed scenarios from various sources (including accidents), complemented by an ontology-based tool to define relevant future/theoretical scenarios. Diverse weather, lighting and road conditions, a broad spectrum of behaviour of other road users as well as edge cases should be considered. Following the collection of such scenarios, which can partly be derived from other projects and collaborations, scenarios need to be shared and centrally stored in a European database. This database should be established by the proposed actions based on an agreed structure and a harmonised scenario description (ontology layer) and metadata framework, in line with the FAIR data principles.
Proposed actions are expected to develop recommendations for harmonisation, standardisation and homologation including the conceptual description of an approval scheme for CCAM systems considering all types of vehicles and fed into on-going discussions regarding EU type vehicle approval rules as well as in the framework of the UNECE.
This topic requires the effective contribution of SSH disciplines and the involvement of SSH experts, institutions, as well as the inclusion of relevant SSH expertise, in order to produce meaningful and significant effects enhancing the societal impact of the related research activities.

In support of the implementation of the Green Deal and the biodiversity strategy, a successful proposal will improve the knowledge to restore ecosystems and halt biodiversity loss, supporting notably the following impact in this destination: ‘Biodiversity decline, its main direct drivers and their interrelations are better understood and addressed’
Projects results are expected to contribute to all following expected outcomes:
Demonstration of the best combinations of interventions and approaches in a simple socio-ecological system; guidelines to upscale them to more complex systems, for the restoration and protection of coastal, marine and connected freshwater biodiversity and ecosystem services and their resilience to environmental changes in both protected and non-protected areas;
Formulation and implementation of European & international marine related policies.
Scope:
Pressures on marine biodiversity, and the ecosystems they form a part of, are increasing at a faster rate than the efforts at protection. Adding to human direct pressures, the effects of climate and environmental changes are becoming main drivers affecting the integrity of marine ecosystems and their capacity to deliver a wide range of multiple essential services and benefits to people. Those global changes are occurring already and have a more rapid affect in the ocean than on land (like warming, stratification, sea level rise, extreme events, pollution, eutrophication, deoxygenation, and acidification).
There is an increasing need for a holistic ecosystem-based and knowledge-based overarching approach that ensures the sustainability and resilience of coastal and marine ecosystems with a Multi Actor Approach involving the four leviers of transformation (science & innovation; economy & finance; individual & collective action; governance). This approach should at the same time integrate and balance different ocean uses and relevant land-based activities to optimise the overall sustainability of the ocean economy.
This topic aims at speeding up the identification, the development and integration of ad hoc measures and holistic ecosystem-based management approaches at larger scale, considering as well the land-sea interactions, especially connected inland waters, that will restore coastal and marine ecosystems and enable the sustainable delivery of services and resilience to rapid climate and environmental changes. To do so, it is necessary to test with no delay several types of interventions, tools and targets (conservation, restoration, holistic ecosystem-based management, marine nature-based solutions, social innovation) at realistic scales, with spatially well-defined socio-ecological system boundaries before upscaling to larger and more complex socio-ecological systems.
In this topic simplified socio-ecological systems are systems where the number of socio-economic activities, governance levels and range of ecosystems diversity are such that they allow for the experiment to be conducted within the duration of a project and the range of funding available. They should include already existing MPAs and/or other area based management tools to allow for a quick start of the project’s testing approaches. For example, but not exclusively, the system composed by the relevant EU Outermost regions, such Azores, Madeira, Canary Islands and Capo Verde (Macaronesia), La Réunion, Maurice and related islands (Mascarene Islands), la Gaudeloupe, Saint Martin and la Martinique (Lesser Antilles), Mayotte (Comoros archipelago), French Guyan, or a system of Mediterranean islands (e.g., the Tuscan Archipelago) could provide an example of a large scale but simplified socio-economic system that could be used for assessing cumulated impacts and identifying solutions. Similarly, the Greenland- Iceland-Faeroe region could offer a site in sub-polar Arctic region for identifying integrated solutions for marine biodiversity management under rapid climate change conditions. Inland, presence of protected areas including human activities can also provide an ideal context to explore these questions.
This topic would allow projects in different simplified socio-ecological system so several measures and approaches could be conducted in parallel with a shared method enabling both highly system specific as well as shared challenges and solutions to be identified cross-islands / interregional cooperation and policy implementation. Social innovation and co-creation of the approaches and solutions by involving the four levers of transformation in the local communities would be central to enable proper scientifically sound and societally acceptable interventions.
Innovative approaches and lessons learnt for upscaling measures and holistic socio-ecological management of marine and coastal ecosystems recognising the need to preserve the inherently dynamic nature of coastal ecosystems and their associated landforms. Projects should build on existing knowledge to avoid duplications and overlaps with past or ongoing research and integrate results from multiple origins, including other EU or national projects.
Where relevant, creating links to and using the information and data of the European Earth observation programme Copernicus, the Group on Earth Observations (GEO) and the Global Earth Observation System of Systems (GEOSS) is expected.
Proposals should outline a plan on how they intend to collaborate with other projects selected under any other relevant topic/call, by e.g. participating in joint activities, workshops, common communication and dissemination activities, etc. Furthermore, the plan should embrace cooperation with the Biodiversity Partnership[1] (HORIZON-CL6-2021-BIODIV-02-01) and other relevant Horizon Europe missions and partnerships. Applicants should allocate the necessary budget to cover the plan. Relevant activities of the plan will be set out and carried out in close co-operation with relevant Commission services, ensuring coherence with related policy initiatives.
Contribution to enhancing the overall societal and public understanding of link between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning through education and training (school & adult education, citizen science platforms)
In order to achieve the expected outcomes, international cooperation is strongly encouraged.

The project will contribute to all of the following expected outcomes
Support public authorities and other organisations engaged in ecosystem restoration to implement and prioritise innovative restoration approaches.
Increase evidence of the potential of innovative restoration approaches to halt biodiversity loss and contribute to carbon storage in sediments and soils.
Build the foundations for large scale restoration projects and related investments.
Scope:
Freshwater ecosystems are degraded due to barriers and other morphological changes, loss of wetlands and floodplains, over abstraction of surface and ground waters, land management that reduces infiltration and generates pollution in land and seas. In responding to the climate and biodiversity crises and acknowledging that healthy water ecosystems are essential for climate adaptation there is an opportunity to determine how to prioritise and deliver aquatic and terrestrial ecosystem restoration at scale throughout Europe, both in rural and urban areas. There is a need to build on recent research from disparate research communities and approaches like the mapping and assessment of ecosystem services to identify how restoration can deliver on multiple objectives (ecosystem services, biodiversity protection, sediment management, climate adaptation, mitigation) and deliver value for citizens.
The objective of this topic is to determine how to implement the restoration of freshwater ecosystems and remove hydromorphological barriers to ensure sustainable environmental flows and to support achievement of good status in both surface and ground waters, long-term water resource management, biodiversity and climate resilience.
This topic should result in a comprehensive review of the knowledge about and past experience with effective approaches to freshwater ecosystem restoration. The scope should include methods for detection and identification of ecosystem degradation, assessment and restoration potential, methods for prioritisation including ones based on mapping of ecosystem services, options for restoration including ones for heavily modified water bodies, approaches to long-term management of restored ecosystems and approaches for monitoring and evaluation including proper evaluation of environmental impacts of restoration options and contribution to climate mitigation. The governance aspects should play important role including strengthening relevant institutions, cross-sectoral collaboration between water and other relevant authorities, financing models for restoration measures, and long term maintenance and protection of restored bodies, economic analysis of costs and benefits, including citizens engagement.

In support of the implementation of the Green Deal and the biodiversity strategy, a successful proposal will improve the knowledge to restore ecosystems and halt biodiversity loss, supporting notably the following impact in this destination: ‘Biodiversity and natural capital are integrated into public and business decision-making at all levels for the protection and restoration of ecosystems and their services; science base is provided for planning and increasing protected areas, and sustainably managing ecosystems’.
Projects results are expected to contribute to all the following expected outcomes:
Prioritisation of future protected areas, restoration areas, and science-based maritime spatial planning (including in larger scale hot spots identified in maritime national plans in order to develop ad hoc plans addressing specific scenarios so as to ameliorate the high impact of human activities over the ecosystem services).
Implementation of the EU biodiversity strategy for 2030 (legally protect a minimum of 30% of the EU’s sea area of which 10% is strictly protected, and integrate ecological corridors, as part of a true Trans-European Nature Network, maritime spatial planning and ecosystem-based management covering all sectors and activities at sea, as well as area-based conservation-management measures) and the Convention on Biological Diversity post-2020 framework.
Improved science based for the description of Ecologically or Biologically Significant marine Areas (EBSA)
Scope:
Restored and properly protected coastal and marine ecosystems bring substantial health, social and economic benefits to coastal communities and the EU and Associated Countries as a whole. The need for stronger action is all the more acute as marine and coastal ecosystem biodiversity loss is severely exacerbated by global warming.
Achieving a good environmental status of marine ecosystems, will be accomplished not only through protected areas and the restoration of important ecosystems but also by the ways we use the sea so that we no longer endanger food security, fishers’ livelihoods, and the fisheries and seafood sectors. The EU biodiversity strategy for 2030 underlines the application of an ecosystem-based management approach to reduce the adverse impacts of fishing, extraction, mining and other human maritime activities, taking into account pressures from land-based activities, especially on sensitive species and seabed habitats. To support this, national maritime spatial plans should aim to cover all blue economy sectors and take into account the natural ecological features and the link between them.
Experience and lessons learnt from existing marine protected areas (MPAs) show that our capacity to identify ideal locations for MPAs, their sizes, borders, management practices and their connectivity fails to consider the different aspects of biodiversity attributes, to recognise climate change impacts and lacks a sound scientific base in relation to certain aspects. The optimal locations, connectivity and restrictions in MPAs required to achieve the protection of biodiversity and ecosystem services remain uncertain and are likely to become even more dynamic as the marine environmental conditions are changing fast.
So far, there has been a predominance of MPAs and projects concerned with genes and species and less with individual traits and inter-specific processes, and very few addressing large-scale habitats and ecosystem level processes. Knowledge and scientific approaches are still lacking to address all biodiversity attributes using a coherent and systemic approach. Links and feedbacks between and within biodiversity attributes, ecosystem services and policy implications are lacking.
By building on and integrating existing knowledge and results from multiple origins, including other EU and national projects, research and innovation could pave the way to fill present gaps on marine biodiversity and its management by better linking spatially ecological features with socio-economic elements. It can also have potential links with activities funded by the European Maritime, Fisheries and Aquaculture Fund (EMFAF), in particular calls and projects on Maritime Spatial Planning.
Design of ad hoc innovative flexible socio-ecological management to cope with a rapidly changing environment for coastal, offshore and deep-sea marine ecosystems, taking into account their connectivity, including through deep-sea migratory species, and the need to preserve their inherent natural dynamics.

A successful proposal will contribute to European Green Deal priorities and the EU biodiversity strategy for 2030, whilst supporting the EU’s response to the coronavirus and other zoonotic outbreaks, in the context of EU’s goal of leading just digital, economic and ecological transitions that will leave no one behind, One Health approaches, and the future European Health Union. It will explore the evolution and spread of microbiomes in the wild and their relationship with biodiversity loss, ecosystems dynamics and epidemics risk, in a broad societal, climate change and global context. By doing so, the interrelations between biodiversity, health and environment (e.g. climate and land use) will be better known and communicated to citizens and policy-makers. In particular, risks associated with microbiomes and biodiversity-friendly prevention/mitigation/restoration measures, and opportunities for biodiversity recovery will be identified. This topic is also expected to have impacts related to ‘Climate change mitigation and adaptation’ and ‘A resilient EU prepared for emerging threats’.
Projects results are expected to contribute to some of the following expected outcomes:
The evolution and spread of microbiomes in the wild and their relationship with biodiversity loss and ecosystems dynamics is understood and modelled, within the broader context of socio-economic driving forces, climate change, public health, and increasing resilience.
Epidemics risks are understood, mapped and forecasted on the basis of relationships between factors such as land use, ecology, climate, biodiversity, and socio-economic factors, including wildlife trade, that determine the pace at which new pathogens emerge and then spread once transmission between humans occurs.
Contribution to ecosystem services: use of novel technologies for better land use and environmental management, increasing (or at least preserving) biodiversity under unfavourable environmental/climatic conditions.
Sustainable prevention/mitigation measures improving microbiomes and biodiversity conservation/recovery are proposed.
Molecular and phylogenetic characterisation of potential emerging and novel pathogens and their hosts in both natural and human-modified areas for use as pre-leads in future vaccines, antimicrobials and other prevention strategies.
Pathogen detection and surveillance strategies, focusing on human populations at risk but also on potential reservoirs and vectors, based on rapid, on-site, genomic tools allowing a fast and early response when facing potential outbreaks.
New multidisciplinary collaborations that embody the One Health/EcoHealth concept are active and efficient as a way to prevent pandemics, sustain biodiversity, promote human, animal and ecosystem health and nature conservation, as well as support the needed transformative change.
Effective strategies to increase awareness and participation of indigenous and local communities in pandemics prevention are in place: risks management and opportunities for biodiversity conservation/recovery are built together.
Scope:
Wildlife microbiomes, whether symbiotic, commensal or pathogenic, and their potential to spread by crossing interspecies barriers, eventually reaching humans via transitional interfaces (e.g. peri-urban, farming areas), are still largely unknown. Complex links between increased human-mediated disturbance, land-use change, natural habitat loss/degradation/fragmentation, climate change and biodiversity loss have all been linked to increases in the increased prevalence and risk of zoonotic disease for a variety of pathogens, mostly driven by human activities that modify the environment or spread pathogens into new ecological niches[1]. Zoonotic diseases are significant threats to human health, with vector-borne diseases accounting for approximately 17 per cent of all infectious diseases and causing an estimated 700,000 deaths globally[2] in a normal year, which can more than double in pandemic years[3].
The magnitude and direction of altered disease incidence due to anthropogenic disturbance differ globally and between ecosystems. Some described mechanisms and drivers that especially affect infectious disease risk are[4] habitat alteration (e.g. deforestation, urbanisation), depletion of predators, biological invasion, host transfer, biodiversity change, human-driven genetic changes, bushmeat hunting and consumption, environmental contamination by infectious agents, international exchanges, trade, etc.
This call aims to recover biodiversity and ecosystems services whilst predicting and preventing future pandemics and epidemic outbreaks, especially in tropical areas and biodiversity hotspots, through collaboration between environmental (including climate), ecological, biomedical and social sciences. Projects should map, identify and characterise (e.g. with molecular techniques) potential emerging pathogens and their hosts/vectors in both carefully selected natural and human-modified areas, explore the relationship of biodiversity and ecosystems dynamics with microbiomes’ evolution and spread, within the broader context of socio-economic driving forces, climate change, public health and animal health.
Pathogen discovery, prophylaxis and operational surveillance strategies should be developed to search for new potential pathogens, within natural and human-modified ecosystems and hosts as well as in cases of human infectious diseases of unknown aetiology, to prevent, detect and contain their outbreaks. Risk maps and predictive models should be built based on development trends, the presence of probable host/bridge species, environmental and socio-economic factors.
The impacts of land use and climate change on biodiversity, ecosystem services and pandemics should be also taken into account, as well as any recent IPBES reports on the links between biodiversity and pandemics[5].
Ecologists, infectious-disease researchers, medical doctors, veterinarians, environmental, public-health and animal-health experts, socio-economic stakeholders and the private sector, particularly SMEs, as well as authorities, civil and political entities, should contribute among others to devise an early warning mechanism, track environmental change, assess the risk of pathogens crossing over and reduce risky human activities.
Efforts to preserve/restore biodiversity should address the economic and socio-cultural factors that drive natural habitat alteration and the rural poor’s dependency on hunting and trading wild animals. International cooperation with non-EU countries where new pathogens have emerged is strongly encouraged. Projects should ensure availability and interoperability of their data with the EC Knowledge Centre for Biodiversity and earmark the necessary resources for cooperation. Collaboration with the Biodiversity Partnership (HORIZON-CL6-2021-BIODIV-02-01) and creating links to its activities is expected[6].

With the focus on quantifying impacts of trade of raw and processed biomass on ecosystems, projects are encouraged to engage in international cooperation (in particular with African countries, Brazil, Latin American and Caribbean countries or the Mediterranean region) to find new leverage points for biodiversity conservation along supply chains and to reduce leakage effects for the EU and associated countries[3].
Scope:
In addition to focusing on limiting the impacts from biomass production and consumption on biodiversity, proposals should look at the whole trade-related value chain, at the scale needed to have a greater effect on protecting and restoring biodiversity. Proposals should analyse how the biomass sector could increase its positive impact on biodiversity. They should support biodiversity to deliver a wide range of ecosystem services, including on mitigating and adapting to climate change.
Proposals should increase the volume of evidence available by taking systematic approaches that take account of links between activities and leakage effects at different stages in the value chain or link production and consumption explicitly, including with institutions, businesses, retailers and investors, civil society, and should cover more than one product at a time.
The knowledge gained should help establish an ‘ecological footprint’ of biomass and the manufactured goods based on biomass, within planetary boundaries as stipulated in the EU bioeconomy strategy[4]. The knowledge should be usable for science-industry cooperation on the bioeconomy[5], and should follow the pollution and climate neutrality targets and commitments, due diligence and human rights requirements, and the policy on just transition, for the service industry and the financial sector.
Proposals should take into account the role of governments as major consumers of goods and services (and the leverage in procurement processes), and of manufacturers and retailers as consumers of primary resources.
The outcomes of these projects should help integrate biodiversity values into the circular economy, for example by cutting waste from the biomass chain, reducing leakage effects, tele-coupling, using carbon and nitrogen footprints in production processes and minimising the use of plastic in the economy. The projects should give explicit values and accounting of these benefits for biodiversity.
Proposals should look at how to further mainstream biodiversity into socio-economic and environmental agendas, from the transformative aspect of minimising the impacts of trade in raw and processed biomass for protecting, sustainably managing and restoring biodiversity and the wide range of ecosystem services it can deliver, in order to nudge pathways towards fair and equitable development and just transitions (1) across the EU Member States and associated countries, and (2) globally.
Proposals should build their analysis on the synergies between multiple Sustainable Development Goals, to deliver directly and indirectly biodiversity benefits. They should highlight the role of biodiversity in attaining the set of Sustainable Development Goals relating to the trade in raw and processed biomass.
Proposals should provide case studies and collect good and failed examples that can serve as useful inputs to these transformations. They should inform and inspire transformative change through learning, co-creation and dialogue.
Proposals should include specific tasks and allocate sufficient resources for coordination measures, to develop joint deliverables (e.g. activities, workshops, joint communication and outreach measures) with all projects on transformative change related to biodiversity funded under this destination. This applies to projects funded under this destination that aim to deliver multiple co-benefits, including on the reduction of biodiversity loss[6]. Proposals should use existing platforms and information sharing mechanisms relevant to promoting transformational change and sharing biodiversity knowledge[7]. Furthermore, projects are expected to cooperate with the European partnership on biodiversity[8] (HORIZON-CL6-2021-BIODIV-02-01) and the Science Service (HORIZON-CL6-2021-BIODIV-01-19).
Proposals should show how their results can provide timely information for relevant IPBES and IPCC functions. They are expected to cooperate with the CBD, and with. with projects ‘HORIZON-CL6-2021-BIODIV-01-20: Support to processes triggered by IPBES and IPCC’, ‘HORIZON-CL6-2022-BIODIV-01-10: Cooperation with the Convention on Biological Diversity’ and ‘HORIZON-CL6-2021-BIODIV-01-21: Impact and dependence of business on biodiversity’.

Deadline date","ExpectedOutcome:
In line with the EU biodiversity strategy, a successful proposal will develop knowledge and tools to understand the role of transformative change for biodiversity policy making, address the indirect drivers of biodiversity loss, and initiate, accelerate and upscale biodiversity-relevant transformative changes in our society.
Proposals should look at how to further mainstream biodiversity into policy making and governance (including financing) for achieving transformative action, both under and above the scope of socio-economic and environmental agendas.
The project should address all following outcomes:
The interlinkages (nexus) between biodiversity, water, food, energy, transport and health in the context of climate change, the underlying causes of biodiversity loss and the determinants of transformative change to achieve the 2050 vision for biodiversity are assessed.
Options for change, showing which societal factors (including policy competences, markets and stakeholder interests) drive transformative change with a positive effect on biodiversity, and which factors drive transitions that have a negative impact on biodiversity in the short-, medium- and long-term, are identified, understood, and co-developed by the relevant actors.
Guidance to facilitate potential just transition pathways and actions at European level to feed into systemic policy decisions. This includes guidance on how to enhance the synergies between biodiversity preservation and action on climate-neutrality, and how to avoid trade-offs.
Specifying the meaning of transformational change in practice, based on case studies illustrating how to put transformational change into action. Creating specific narratives, business models and policies, including on nature-based solutions for climate mitigation and adaptation, water and health, to aid the transition to a biodiversity- and climate friendly, sustainable Europe.
Knowledge is produced (e.g. meta-studies[1], publications) and made available by 2023-2024, fit for the production of IPBES assessments on transformational change and on the nexus between biodiversity, climate, water, food and health. Putting in place measures to build capacity, policy support, and science brokerage of project results, including after the release dates of the IPBES assessments, by effective and impactful dissemination.
Scientists dispose of a network that facilitates and promotes research on transformational change for biodiversity across natural and social sciences[2].
Approaches, tools and knowledge influence policies at appropriate level on transformative change for biodiversity – the key elements for this change are delivered by the portfolio of cooperating projects (of which this project forms part of).
Scope:
The European Green Deal and its biodiversity strategy call for transformative change, which requires the policy and tools to bring about transformative change. The post-2020 biodiversity goals risks to be missed from the outset if the required policy decisions are not taken and implementation is not secured. Policy makers find the task of translating science on transformative change into policy daunting and challenging. This is where European research and innovation together with the community outside academia (business, government organisations etc.) must urgently demonstrate what transformative change could actually mean and achieve for biodiversity. There is also a need for practical guidance to policy makers and society on the impacts of the necessary structural, ecological, social and economic transformations the European Green Deal could achieve.
The European Union and associated countries still need to identify the key factors in society that can stimulate or hinder this transition across the continent and share such findings with other regions of the world. This includes research into behavioural, social, cultural, economic, institutional, infrastructure, technical and technological factors.
Proposals should focus on indirect drivers of biodiversity loss: production and consumption patterns, human population dynamics and trends, trade, technological innovations, local to global governance (including financing), which in turn cause the direct drivers (land and sea use change, over-exploitation, climate change, pollution, invasive species).
With the focus on biodiversity, and links to human activity, proposals should examine how transformative change takes place in different societal and cultural contexts. They should look at what triggers these changes and what obstacles there are (behavioural, financial, policy, institutional, power setting etc). The proposals should measure and model their impact; and provide options for action (at individual, business and society level) to promote and enable transformative changes, including through nature-based solutions. Social innovation and the gender dimension should be explored when the solution is at the socio-technical interface and requires social change, new social practices, social ownership or market uptake. The proposals should should look at gender dynamics and diversity to investigate how different identities and social groups are tangibly promoting transformative changes through bottom-up transition initiatives for sustainable lifestyles that are of major relevance to biodiversity.
The Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) is for biodiversity and ecosystems services what IPCC is for climate change. In this context, this topic should support the upcoming IPBES assessments, expected to deliver in 2023-24, on transformational change and on the nexus of biodiversity, climate, water, food and health, with an additional focus on energy and transport. The IPBES assessment is expected to examine, inter alia:
(a) Values (relational, utilitarian, etc.) and how they influence behaviour;
(b) Notions of good quality of life, worldviews and cultures, models of interaction between nature and people and social narratives;
(c) The role of social norms and regulations, and of economic incentives and other institutions in leveraging behavioural change in individuals, businesses, communities and societies;
(d) The role of technologies and technology assessment;
(e) The role of collective action;
(f) The role of complex systems and transitions theory;
(g) Obstacles to achieving transformative change;
(h) Equity and the need for “just transitions”;
(i) Lessons from previous transitions.
The project should feed input into this assessment, critically examining the usability of the IPBES conceptual framework for these aspects.
Proposals should provide case studies and collect good and failed examples, including current and business models, the role of citizen science, and scenarios that could provide useful input into these transformations and inform and inspire transformative change through learning, co-creation and dialogue.
Proposals should build their analysis on synergies between multiple Sustainable Development Goals to deliver both direct and indirect biodiversity benefits. They should also look at the role of biodiversity in reaching the set of Sustainable Development Goals, when related to the interlinkages (nexus) between biodiversity, water, food, energy, transport and health[3] in the context of climate change, the underlying causes of biodiversity loss, and the determinants of transformative change.
Proposals should include specific tasks and allocate sufficient resources to develop joint deliverables (e.g. activities, workshops, joint communication and outreach) with all projects on transformative change related to biodiversity funded under this destination. They should use existing platforms and information sharing mechanisms relevant to transformational change and to biodiversity knowledge[4]. Furthermore, cooperation is expected with the Biodiversity Partnership (HORIZON-CL6-2021-BIODIV-02-01), the Science Service HORIZON-CL6-2021-BIODIV-01-19, and the Convention on Biological Diversity and projects under ‘HORIZON-CL6-2021-BIODIV-01-20: Support to processes triggered by IPBES and IPCC’ and ‘HORIZON-CL6-2022-BIODIV-01-10: Cooperation with the Convention on Biological Diversity’.

","single-stage
Deadline date","ExpectedOutcome:
The successful proposal will contribute to fostering a sustainable, balanced and inclusive development of rural areas, supporting the implementation of the European Green Deal[1], in particular its fair and just transition component, the European digital strategy[2], the European pillar of social rights[3] and the EU long-term vision for rural areas[4]. It will do so by improving the understanding of the environmental, socio-economic, behavioural, cultural and demographic drivers of change in rural areas. Stronger evidence on which to build their strategies and initiatives will empower rural people to act for change and get prepared to achieve climate neutrality by 2050, adapt to climate change, and turn digital and ecological transitions into increased resilience, good health and positive long-term prospects, including jobs, for all including women, young people and vulnerable groups.
Projects results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:
more evidence-based, place-based, integrated and tailored policies, strategies and governance frameworks at local, regional, national and EU levels to drive the sustainable transition of rural areas and communities, building on the specific outcomes below;
a refined understanding by policy-makers and rural actors of the diversity of rural situations, and of the challenges and opportunities associated with megatrends, potential major shocks and upcoming transitions, in particular climate, environmental and social challenges, to tailor policy interventions to local realities;
a refined understanding by policy-makers and rural actors of functional characteristics of territories, functional relations between rural places and other rural and/or urban places within a territorial continuum and the importance of these relations for sustainable development, to design synergistic approaches favouring a networked and interlinked development; and
a refined assessment by policy-makers of the impact of all current and upcoming policies on rural communities (rural proofing[5]), including sectoral or thematic policies (such as climate, energy, mobility, digitalisation, health and social inclusion), or policy frameworks designed to accompany sustainability transitions in general, to tailor interventions to maximise possibilities for rural communities to contribute to and benefit from these transitions.
Scope:
The EU aims to lead just digital, economic and ecological transitions that will leave no one behind. Close to one third of EU citizens live in rural areas, which represent 83% of the EU territory and supply the whole of society with essential goods and services. These broad figures hide a variety of situations, challenges and opportunities regarding the aforementioned transitions that the current evidence base insufficiently captures.
The design of positive governance frameworks and policy interventions for rural communities is hampered by i) the lack of conceptual frameworks that properly grasp the role of rural areas and communities in sustainable development and sustainability transitions; ii) a lack of data on several aspects at the right geographic scale, in particular on climate and environment performance and on social challenges, quality of life and well-being. The lack of data at the right geographical scale (local in many cases) is hampered by the technical and economic difficulties of finer data collection.
Proposals should explore innovative and out-of-the box ways to describe and characterise rural areas or various forms or degrees of rurality in multi-dimensional ways, screening a wide range of possible (including new) data sources going beyond conventional indicators such as population density and settlement configuration. They should analyse national and other definitions and approaches and engage with stakeholders to understand their perspectives on rurality. Proposals should define and describe functional linkages between various localities and territories and explore and develop ways to apply functional geography approaches to rural areas (e.g. developing the concept of functional rural area), learning from past work[6] and failures on such approaches. Trade-offs in selected approaches should be analysed in regional and national contexts highlighting geographical differences.
Proposals should screen and benchmark the performance and cost efficiency (infrastructure needs, ease and frequency of updates etc.) of data collection methods and technologies including new ones (e.g. digital technologies, geolocation and geospatial techniques, crowd sourcing, citizen science) that could be used to collect the necessary rural data at the local level across a majority of EU Member States and Associated Countries in Europe, at affordable costs and select viable options for testing these options. They should strengthen rural evidence and rural data collection, documentation and access, in particular in the environmental, climate and social fields by generating data and designing, testing and implementing methods to:
calculate climate and environmental indicators for rural communities, including rural dwellers and secondary-homers;
upgrade socio-economic (including culture) assessment, analysis, monitoring and evaluation tools (stats, indicators, including the measurement of well-being, quality of life and attractiveness including gender and age differences);
assess resilience to major threats, with particular emphasis on resilience and vulnerability factors under the COVID-19 pandemic.
This should result in enriched, upgraded and regularly updated platforms, data and indicators mapping, describing and monitoring economic (including sectors, jobs and income), social (including quality of life and well-being) and environmental (including climate mitigation and adaptation and energy) characteristics of rural areas and communities at sub-regional, local or functional levels, contributing to relevant actions of the long-term vision for rural areas in this domain. The analysis carried out should help to grasp the diversity and specificity of rural places in the EU and Associated Countries, their inter-relations, their preparedness for transitions, major shocks and megatrends, their capacity to take advantage of these trends in adaptive and resilient ways.
Proposals should benchmark climate and environmental policies and existing frameworks to describe and measure well-being, quality of life and attractiveness, assess their relevance for rural areas and communities and make recommendations for adapting these frameworks. They should in particular propose innovative schemes to reach climate neutrality by 2050 while taking advantage of the ecological transition and preserving ecosystems (nature-based solutions), landscapes etc. Finally, they should support rural proofing[7] by developing tools completing those already existing on territorial impacts (e.g. under the EU Better Regulation[8]), to assess the impact of EU policies and programmes on rural areas and communities.
Proposals must implement the multi-actor approach, bringing together from the start multiple types of scientific expertise in both hard sciences (e.g. climate, energy, and environment) and social sciences and humanities (e.g. geography, sociology, behavioural sciences, policy, foresight) together with a variety of rural community representatives. This topic should involve the effective contribution of SSH disciplines. Projects outputs should be scalable at least to the EU as a whole, hence they should be developed using data from a representative diversity of rural contexts across the EU. Proposals should strengthen evidence on rural areas and communities in a multi-dimensional way (proposals focused on one particular sector -e.g. primary production- or dimension of sustainability would not be considered as addressing the challenge appropriately). Proposals should engage with both national authorities and rural communities on their understanding of rurality and on project developments. Proposals should foresee a task to work jointly with other projects funded under this topic and with the European Commission, its common agricultural policy[9] networks[10] and other relevant networks (e.g.: future Farm Sustainability Data Network (FSDN)[11]) and projects (including research projects[12]) contributing to building rural evidence.
The possible participation of the JRC in the project will consist of connecting project activities to on-going work on integrated territorial strategies and or various domains mentioned in the topic to ensure complementarities and synergies, in particular advising on the data collection methods to be tested and on filling-in data gaps at high spatial granularity (NUTS3, LAU or grid levels). The contribution is framed on the context of the Knowledge Centre for Territorial Policies.

It will do so by accelerating the deployment of digital, nature-based, social and community-led innovations in rural areas through capacity building and enhanced knowledge exchange, leading to rural communities that will be better equipped with innovative and smarter solutions that increase access to services, opportunities and adequate innovation ecosystems. Enhanced capacities and better knowledge flows and innovation support will empower rural people to act for change and get prepared to achieve climate neutrality by 2050, adapt to climate change, and turn digital and ecological transitions into increased resilience, good health and positive long-term prospects, including jobs, for all including women, young people and vulnerable groups.
Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:
enhanced capacity of rural communities and rural people to innovate for change thanks to the specific outcomes below;
improved skills and knowledge of rural citizens, entrepreneurs, organisations, local action groups[5] and community leaders of existing tools to develop and implement rural innovation (including social innovation) strategies and innovative actions to implement these strategies in rural communities, in all domains of relevance to rural life and economy;
shortening of the innovation cycle in rural communities and businesses leading to quicker results and transitions in rural communities, strengthened human capital, including more lively networks and improved attractiveness of rural communities, in particular for women and young people;
enhanced valorisation by rural communities of the results of rural innovation projects funded under various programmes; and
enhanced dialogue and cooperation on rural innovation worldwide, with sharing of learning resources.
Scope:
Proposals should provide capacity building on rural innovation towards rural communities and actors in the EU and beyond, seeking to valorise the outcomes of projects funded under various programmes. The latter may include Horizon 2020, Horizon Europe, the common agricultural policy (LEADER, EIP-AGRI operational groups), regional policy (community-led local development, INTERREG, smart specialisation strategies), preparatory actions such as the Smart rural project[6] or SMARTA[7] and other EU or non-EU relevant actions. Projects from these programmes should be considered as relevant if they produced practical tools to develop and/or implement strategies and roadmaps in various domains (energy, digital, climate adaptation and mitigation, mobility, environment, social, education and care, food etc.), innovation approaches such as living labs, activities related to smart villages; training packages, videos etc. innovation activities in general and innovative solutions. Proposals should pay special attention to social innovation[8], which has been demonstrated to have a high potential to meet rural challenges. Social innovation is recommended when the solution is at the interface between social and technical solutions and requires social change, new social practices, social ownership or market uptake. Capacity building should target in particular communities developing smart village strategies[9] as foreseen under the common agricultural policy for 2021-2027[10] or similar initiatives, paying attention to the needs of various groups within these communities (e.g. women, youth etc.). They should map and promote funding opportunities and prepare the ground for rural communities to take part in innovation actions funded under Horizon Europe or other innovation support actions that can be used to support ecological, digital or social transitions in rural areas (whether or not they are targeted to these areas).
Proposals should organise the capitalisation and exchange of knowledge between projects funded under Horizon Europe working on innovation for rural communities. They should feed in and translate results from the research and innovation actions as these results become available. They should allow the portfolio of projects to reflect on rural innovation processes, lessons learnt and ways to improve innovation processes and innovation systems for rural communities in a multi-dimensional and multi-sectoral way. They should also ensure a lively interface between actions supporting rural community-led innovation funded under Horizon Europe (e.g. HORIZON-CL6-2022-COMMUNITIES-01-01 and HORIZON-CL6-2022-COMMUNITIES-02-01-two-stage in the work programme 2021-2022) and common agricultural policy networks[11]. The project duration should be adapted to ensure such capitalisation is possible (a duration of at least five years is recommended). They may engage in collaboration with projects funded under other relevant calls[12].
Proposals should explore with rural communities and benchmark various options and business models to create viable, networked and long-term rural innovation expertise and training mechanisms, centre(s) or hub(s) in Europe, able to capitalise on new knowledge and tools created and process them into training packages and sessions for rural communities in Europe and beyond. They should engage with international partners, including relevant international organisations (e.g. FAO, OECD) and partners in priority regions of the world for EU international cooperation on rural development (e.g. Africa) or with outstanding expertise in rural development, on resources to support the sustainable development of rural communities. Proposals may include partners from these countries in capacity building activities.
Proposals must implement the multi-actor approach, bringing together the required competencies in communication, dissemination, exploitation and training alongside genuine knowledge of rural communities’ context. Training contents and packages should be provided in multiple languages and multimedia formats allowing their wide dissemination in the EU and beyond. They should be developed, tested and validated taking into account the specific needs of various types of rural actors (including women, young people, entrepreneurs, community-leaders, elderly etc.) in various types of rural areas (e.g. close to cities, remote etc.) and cover a wide variety of important aspects of rural life that rural communities may want to innovate on (e.g. energy, mobility, education, services, health, climate, environment etc.). Proposals focusing on one type of activity or sector (e.g. primary production) would not be considered as addressing the challenge appropriately. Synergies may be developed with other actions targeting community-based innovations in specific domains, innovation support or education and training.

","single-stage
Deadline date","ExpectedOutcome:
In line with the European Green Deal priorities and the farm to fork strategy for a fair healthy and environmentally friendly food system, as well as of the EU's Climate ambition for 2030 and 2050, the successful proposal will support the development of policies, business models and market conditions contributing to the sustainable, balanced and inclusive development of urban and peri-urban areas and to the empowerment and resilience of their communities, who can access, afford and choose healthier, nutritious and environmental-friendly food.
Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:
City-region food systems and of the urban-rural linkages across Europe are better understood and taken into account in urban policies;
The concept of local food environments is better understood and taken into account in local planning, with a view to driving people towards healthier food choices and transforming urban food systems to be healthier, circular and resilient;
More cities and towns build on good practice initiatives (e.g.: signatory cities of the Milan Urban Food Policy Pact) to develop integrated urban food policies and planning frameworks linking health, environment and food systems, bridging the national and the local level and including risk prevention and reduction plans to anticipate and manage food systems shocks, as well as to develop resilience;
Strengthened urban food systems governance through increased multi-stakeholder engagement in designing and implementing urban food policies in cities and towns across Europe, representing different cultural and geographical settings;
More Higher Education Institutes engaging in structured and long-term collaborations with local/regional actors to help transform their urban food system through participatory R&I;
Improved decision-making by government actors willing to commit to change their local food systems, based on ready-to-use knowledge on the typologies, evolution, outcomes and impacts of integrated local food policies, throughout and within Europe, and in comparison with other regions.
Scope:
Urban areas face a serious challenge to ensure healthy, affordable, safe and sustainably produced food to their residents. Many cities and their inhabitants are disconnected from their food – e.g. where it comes from, how it is produced, the impact food production and consumption have on the environment, climate and health, and the complexity and fragility of food value chains –. The way in which cities deal with food is highly variable and often fragmented, but integrated urban food policies and social innovations providing co-benefits are progressively emerging throughout Europe.
A key issue to be addressed is that of poorly planned urban food environments that drive citizens, and children in particular, towards unhealthy packaged food that is high in calories, sugars, salt and saturated fat, which contributes to obesity and diet-related illnesses. Furthermore, different shocks disrupting urban food systems worldwide can exacerbate the already limited access to healthy food, in particular for the urban poor.
Cities have the potential to make healthy and sustainable food available, affordable and attractive to all, which will in turn reduce consumption-based GHG emissions, in a win-win situation for people and the planet.
Proposals under this topic should address the following four issues and be targeted to help at least 5 cities/towns lacking integrated food systems policies to take ambitious and decisive action:
Understanding: map local food systems, policies and actions, with a special focus on assessing short supply chains and urban food environments (including harmful marketing and advertising and unequal access to healthy food for the urban poor), and on developing local indicators and monitoring frameworks.
This should be built on existing tools such as the “Food systems dashboard framework” and should include the development of food systems stakeholder maps, maps of the formal and informal food flows and retail channels and, especially relevant in case of food shock crisis, maps identifying the most vulnerable people and their access to nutritious food.
This should include analysing the local responses to emergencies and take into account the environmental, social and economic dimension.
Governance: develop and evaluate innovative, multi-actor, urban food systems governance processes and capacities for science-backed integrated policy making and implementation actions that deliver on farm to fork strategy objectives and Food 2030 co-benefits for health, environment, climate, circularity and inclusion, while minimizing trade-offs. Special attention should be given to improving food environments, providing increased food access to vulnerable groups and fostering short supply chains.
Engaging: mobilise a wide diversity of food system actors from farm to fork (i.e. public and private, the financial sector, civil society and academia). Higher education institutions and research centres, in particular, should be engaged to collaboration with local actors to support evidence-based food policy development and to help provide local solutions to integrated food system challenges.
Mutual learning: reinforce or create new networks of cities and towns to share good practices and learn from and support each other. This implies involving cities with well-developed food policies to provide guidance and lessons learned, as well as new forms of collaboration/twinning.
Proposals should address inequalities in urban food systems, whether they be due to gender, race and other social categories.
Conducting inter and trans-disciplinary research and involving a wide diversity of food system actors is required to implement the multi actor approach (cf eligibility condition). In particular, a strong involvement of citizens and civil society, together with urban designers, design thinkers, social innovators, planners, social scientists and public authorities to strengthen relationships between urban planning and food choices and to develop new methods and approaches to innovation have to be ensured.
Proposals should set out a clear plan on how it will collaborate with other projects selected under this and any other relevant topic/call, e.g. by participating in joint activities, workshops, as well as common communication and dissemination activities.
Social innovation is recommended when the solution is at the socio-technical interface and requires social change, new social practices, social ownership or market uptake.

In line with the European Green Deal objectives and the EU forest strategy, successful proposals will support the resilience and adaptation of forests and the forest-based sector contributing to advance the understanding and science, and support adaptation and resilience of natural and managed ecosystems, water and soil systems and economic sectors in the context of the changing climate.
Project results are expected to contribute to all following expected outcomes:
Strengthened international cooperation with actors from China in the areas of forest adaptation to climate change
Comprehensive knowledge base on the impact of climate change on forests and their capacity to adapt
Increased adaptation efforts in climate change hotspots in the EU/associated countries (mountains, Mediterranean, Northern Scandinavian Peninsula, Central and Eastern Europe, outermost regions) and China
Informed decision-making by forest managers adopting sustainable forest management practices.
Knowledge transfer and capacity building at science-policy-practice interface.
Scope:
Adaptation and increased resilience of forests is essential for the forests to maintain their function as carbon sinks, to protect existing stocks and to ensure that forests will continue to provide important ecosystem services and to support the forest-based bioeconomy. Due to the high variation of European and Chinese forests, diversity of landscapes as well as governance and ownership structures, adaptation strategies need to be adapted to regional conditions and circumstances, with focus on the most vulnerable forests in climate change hotspots.
Proposals will:
Develop and refine projections at regional scale, improve the modelling of effects on natural vegetation, both at individual and ecosystem level and support science-based decisions with a view to the sustainable management of forests, including activities related to afforestation, reforestation and regeneration.
Design adaptation plans to increase the resilience of forests by active management of the species composition and the genetic diversity within these species (including through assisted species migration, and forest regeneration and afforestation with species already adapted and / or further improved to tolerate or even benefit from future climate conditions) while supporting forest production and ecosystem services under climate change in the various regions and forest types of Europe.
Analyse socio-economic aspects of forest adaptation, including forest managers’ and users’ perception and factors influencing their decision making such as consumer choices, sectorial integration and international/domestic competition and analyse the potential of incentives and tools to reach forest managers and to encourage changes towards preventive strategies/measures by taking into account the different forms of forest governance and ownership.
The project must implement the multi-actor approach and ensure an adequate involvement of the primary production sector and the wider forest-based value chain.
In this topic the integration of the gender dimension (sex and gender analysis) in research and innovation content is not a mandatory requirement.
Proposals should include a task to collaborate with projects financed under the topic HORIZON-CL6-2022-CLIMATE-01-05: Forestry: European observatory of climate change impacts and demonstration network of climate smart restoration pilots. Actions will contribute to implementing the EU-China Food, Agriculture and Biotechnology (FAB) flagship initiative, which aims to ensure sustainability of agri-food systems, catering for the needs of a growing population, the reduction of food and agricultural losses and waste, and the provision of safe and healthy foodstuffs.
Due to the scope of this topic, international cooperation is strongly encouraged, in particular with China. This topic is envisaged to be implemented as a coordinated call but if no agreement is reached with the Ministry of Science and Technology China (MOST) on the co-funding of Chinese partners, it will be implemented as a normal call.

Deadline date","ExpectedOutcome:
The successful proposal will contribute to fostering a sustainable, balanced and inclusive coastal development, supporting the implementation of the European Green Deal, incorporating a better understanding of the environmental, socio-economic, behavioural, cultural and demographic drivers of change. Conducted research activities and innovative results will empower people to act for change through education and upgraded skills, leading to positive long-term prospects, including jobs, for all including women, young people and vulnerable groups. Among several potential coastal sectors being addressed, the proposal will ensure inclusion of tourism, recreational and leisure activity development in coastal areas to respect long-term environmental carrying capacity, and social goals.
Project results are expected to contribute to all the following expected outcomes:
Better understanding of the environmental, socio-economic, behavioural, cultural and demographic drivers of change for users of the sea in coastal areas is taken into account by the policy making community.
Better understanding of the nature connectedness of coastal communities and preconditions, hurdles and success factors for social transition and nature-based social innovation inspired the policy making community to take measures.
Socio-economic resilience and well-being of coastal communities (including gender related) are measured, understood and enhanced through a properly developed and established link with coastal ecosystem services and cultural heritage.
Empowerment of coastal communities and sectors to innovate for the ecological transition and feel part of it, through a multi-actor approach.
Design of transition mechanisms and identification of the means to make necessary changes socially acceptable, that among others may include curiosity-driven citizen science initiatives and outcomes connected to specific societal and blue bioeconomy-related socio-economic challenges on coastal climate adaptation and mitigation, coastal pollution, coastal biodiversity, circularity and sustainability or other aspects of coastal (eco)tourism and cultural events etc.
Creation of a well-connected community, involving companies, local businesses, social innovators, private investors, researchers, citizens and policy makers, which will bring together on the one hand research actions and results and on the other implementation actions, new initiatives, and policy developments for their own companies or local communities.
Improved skills in ocean literacy education and awareness raising, social sciences, green skills and digital transformation to process and integrate large network input of gradually more ‘Green and Blue Literate’ citizens that are more engaged to take direct and sustainable action.
Contributions to Maritime Spatial Planning and Integrated Maritime Policy, including the Water Framework Directive and the Marine Strategy Framework Directive.
Contribute to the UN SDG 1, SDG 2, SDG 3, SDG 5, SDG 10, SDG 11 and with a specific emphasis on UN SDG 14.
Scope:
The multi- and trans-disciplinary proposals should undertake a thorough analysis of gaps in ocean literacy, marine environment connectedness like monetary and non-monetary values of the marine environment, socio-economic vulnerability and resilience (including gender-related) and preparedness for the social transition of coastal communities and stakeholders in order to advance understanding of the preconditions and success factors for social transition and nature-based social innovation. Proposals should deal with environmental and socio-economic challenges related to coastal climate adaptation and mitigation, coastal pollution, coastal ecology, coastal habitability and entrepreneurship, blue spaces and well-being, coastal (eco)tourism and cultural events, coastal food and energy production and consumption among others. Proposals should identify opportunities based on coastal ecosystem services and active engagement and participation of the users of the sea in designing, implementing and maintaining nature-based solutions (including monitoring activities on the performance and impacts of the solutions), taking into account cultural heritage aspects where relevant. SSH approaches should serve through a multi-actor approach to orient and contextualise coastal STEAM (science, technology, engineering, arts and mathematics) activities related to the above-mentioned challenges in terms of social and economic impact as well as in terms of the deep impact of human behaviour, culture (including indigenous knowledge and practices) and history (including religion literacy) on all societal innovation and integrated sustainable coastal zone development and management. Proposals should engage or create appropriate multi-stakeholder platforms who should jointly evaluate cultural, societal and economic marine or coastal practices that are not compatible with sustainability principles, avoiding duplication with other projects, existing initiatives or platforms. They should jointly identify required cultural and societal changes for a sustainable use of the sea, design transition mechanisms and identify the means to achieve necessary changes. Attention needs to be given to different learning arrangements (e.g. multi-actor networks, producer-consumer association, hybrid innovative networks, territorial alliances, twinning approaches) as well as to innovative governance mechanisms at various levels, and their potential implications for social transition and nature-based social innovation. Activities should cover diverse types of coastal areas across the EU and Associated Countries and non-European (Black Sea and Mediterranean) countries. In line with the objectives of the EU Global Approach to Research and Innovation[1], proposals are strongly encouraged to include third country participants, especially those established in Black Sea and Mediterranean countries.
This topic should involve the effective contribution of SSH disciplines.
The involvement of sea-based businesses, and economic and local development bodies is required to implement the multi-actor approach (cf eligibility conditions). Engaging with managing authorities of European Structural and Investment Funds during the project would help increase implementation of the project outcomes and support further uptake.
Projects should build on existing knowledge and integrate results from multiple origins, including other EU, international or national projects. Some cooperation activities with projects financed under Destination ‘Biodiversity and ecosystem services’ and topics of the Green Deal Call could be included, as well as with relevant projects from other EU programmes or with relevant EU initiatives and thematic networks.
This topic should be linked to the Horizon Europe Missions Ocean, seas and waters and Adaptation to Climate Change including Societal Transformation, the Partnership for a climate neutral, sustainable and productive Blue Economy, the Biodiversity Partnership or other partnerships where relevant.
Social innovation[2] is recommended when the solution is at the socio-technical interface and requires social change, new social practices, social ownership or market uptake.

Deadline date","ExpectedOutcome:
A successful proposal will contribute to the EU’s goal of leading just digital, economic and ecological transitions that will leave no one behind, supporting in particular European Green Deal priorities such as the biodiversity strategy for 2030. It will support the empowerment of rural, coastal and urban communities to act for change and to contribute to the Green Deal objectives through education and upgraded skills regarding the design, implementation and benefits of nature-based solutions (NBS)[1]. By doing so, communities will be better prepared to adapt to climate change through the deployment of NBS, and turn digital and ecological transitions into increased resilience and positive long-term prospects, including jobs for all, notably for young people.
Project results are expected to contribute to all following expected outcomes:
Increased awareness of the value of NBS to educate children and young people in an innovative and holistic way, developing 21st century competencies, values and attitudes through an active and engaging pedagogy.
NBS teaching programmes and materials are more widely available across the EU.
Local communities across the EU are stimulated to co-create NBS, thus contributing to greater upscaling and impact of these solutions.
Increase awareness and long-term public engagement on NBS and their benefits, enhancing citizens' capacity to act as responsible and participative actors in a knowledge-based society.
Scope:
Citizens and experts have identified better awareness of the opportunities, benefits, and limitations of nature-based solutions (NBS) as one of the main factors that could facilitate the transition to more sustainable cities and territories, and help build physical and mental resilience. Examples of NBS include green roofs and green walls that cool down cities in the summer; parks that may contribute to air purification and provide leisure and exercise opportunities to citizens; green corridors connecting natural areas; urban food gardens, etc.
NBS build on nature and ecosystems to deliver social, ecological, and economic benefits, increasing biodiversity and contributing to climate change adaptation and mitigation. Their large educational potential remains quite unexplored, whilst innovative programmes and resources around NBS for children and families have only recently started to appear in formal and informal education. Building on scientific evidence and experiences from NBS projects in cities and involving teachers in different countries, an educational pilot study in 2020 exploited research results to develop educational programmes and resources, raising awareness on NBS and their benefits in primary and secondary schools[2].
The scope of the present topic is to upscale that pilot, broaden its geographical and educational reach, and increase its impact. The successful proposal should set up a multidisciplinary, pan-European network of education professionals, researchers, public authorities, multipliers and civil society to integrate and help create awareness and mainstream NBS-related EU research and innovation into primary and secondary schools, vocational training and higher education centres (e.g. architecture and engineering), influencers, mass media and other multipliers.
The successful proposal should develop learning scenarios, formal and informal education activities and training programmes for teachers to mainstream biodiversity and NBS in education at all levels, in a broad range of disciplines (not exclusively STEM), adaptable, freely available in all European languages, to be used inside and outside (remote learning, classroom, in/with nature, outdoors).
Actions should build on the results of the pilot project and the growing corpus of EU-funded project results, networks and initiatives to develop innovative, open-access educational programmes and materials to raise awareness on NBS and their social, economic and environmental benefits among children, young people and their families in an interdisciplinary, problem-based learning approach. They should combine the use of ICT (e.g. games, apps, etc), remote learning, audio-visual productions and social media with real-life experiences in nature and local NBS, such as educational green roofs and urban gardens. All programmes and materials should be tested in a network of pilots and should convey a call for action for students to engage with local stakeholders (e.g. involving celebrities as NBS 'ambassadors', where appropriate) and reflect on the different ethical, economic, environmental and social aspects related to NBS, including gender aspects. Responsible research and innovation (RRI) guidelines and tools should be applied. The work that the JRC may have developed on a competence framework for sustainability during the lifetime of the project should also be taken into account.
Relationships should be considered between educational programmes, together with practitioners and policy-makers (e.g. linking up living-lab models and embedding demonstration approaches and NBS projects in conjunction with local schools, universities and colleges).
Proposals should ensure that all evidence, information and project outputs will be openly accessible through the Oppla (the EU repository for NBS) and Scientix (the community for science education) portals[3].
Applicants should create synergies with projects under the same topic and other relevant ongoing or up-coming projects, notably the Horizon 2020 NBS project portfolio and its task forces; ‘HORIZON-CL6-2021-BIODIV-01-05: The economics of nature-based solutions: cost-benefit analysis, market development and funding’; ‘HORIZON-CL6-2022-BIODIV-01-03: Network for nature: multi-stakeholder dialogue platform to promote nature-based solutions’; ‘HORIZON-CL6-2022-COMMUNITIES-01-05: Assessing the socio-politics of nature-based solutions for more inclusive and resilient communities’; ‘HORIZON-CL6-2022-COMMUNITIES-02-02-two-stage: Developing nature-based therapy for health and well-being’. To this end, proposals should include dedicated tasks and appropriate resources for coordination measures, foresee joint activities and joint deliverables.

However, more action is needed to (1) address the fragmentation of this innovation ecosystem across food systems and bio-based sectors, (2) to create linkages between the different levels of governance, and (3) to improve the interfacing between the research communities, the innovation communities, investors and citizens. Actions that address these areas of improvement across the bioeconomy are to be preferred because their crosscutting nature and trans-disciplinarity might be a further source of innovation and system transformation, and because they enable sharing of best practices across sectors and actors.
Proposals are expected to:
Identify instruments and initiatives that contribute to spreading knowledge and deploying innovations in and across food systems and bio-based sectors, at EU, national, regional, and local level. Identify links with other policies (e.g. education) and instruments (e.g. financial instruments, regulation);
Analyse possible interactions and complementarities between initiatives, instruments and policies;
Identify opportunities for improved governance and for enhanced cooperation between instruments and initiatives within the bioeconomy’s innovation ecosystems, across the EU, Member States and private sector;
Recommend actions to improve bioeconomy innovation and the deployment of new knowledge, technologies and practices, in particular by strengthening cooperation between entities and activities that support different forms of innovation.
Proposals should:
Map the structures, instruments and initiatives that make up the innovation ecosystem of the bioeconomy with respect to food systems, bio-based sectors (including the blue economy), at local, regional, national and EU level
Put in place networking and matchmaking activities to allow these structures, instruments and initiatives to raise their profile, to identify opportunities for new collaborations both amongst themselves, and across the different sectors of the bioeconomy
Provide advisory support to these structures, instruments and initiatives to align themselves to policy priorities at different levels of governance, and in full awareness of existing schemes of sustainability and circularity indicators of the bioeconomy
Identify best practices to improve the exploitation of outcomes from funded research within innovation communities, innovators and entrepreneurs, and public and private investment communities
Examine the possibilities for improved reporting on the state-of-play and results of innovation in the bioeconomy
Address specific barriers to reducing the fragmentation of the innovation ecosystem
Deliver specific recommendations related to thematic financial instruments and tools applicable to sectors of the bioeconomy and to innovation. Targets of this activity should be previously mapped public and private investors, entrepreneurs and all the structures, institutes, programs and initiatives. Advice should focus on the effective and integrated use of financial tools to support innovation in the long term, and on the contribution to building a sustainable and responsible financing framework in Europe
Where appropriate, link to Horizon 2020 and Horizon Europe projects that demonstrate innovative and cross-sectoral solutions, as well as to relevant EU initiatives (for example those linked to : European Innovation Partnerships, European Innovation Council, European Institute of Innovation & Technology).
Engage with policy makers and other stakeholders/initiative-owners that are responsible for innovation support at different levels of governance, to co-create recommendations to improve bioeconomy innovation and the deployment of new knowledge, technologies and practices
Proposals should set out a clear plan on how they foresee to collaborate with other projects selected under this and any other relevant topics/calls, by participating in joint activities, workshops, as well as common communication and dissemination activities.
This topic should involve the effective contribution of SSH disciplines.

","single-stage
Deadline date","ExpectedOutcome:
Improved coordination of national research programmes on food, agriculture and the wider Bioeconomy with a view to integrate them better within the European Research Area (ERA) through:
Regular portfolio analysis to support a better structured organisation, facilitation and reporting of SCAR Strategic and Collaborative Working Groups`(SWGs/CWGs) activities on the various themes of main relevance for Horizon Europe, the common agricultural policy, the Green Deal, Digital Europe and the farm to fork and biodiversity strategies. This will lead to enhanced R&I cooperation between Member States and Associated Countries and to synergies at national and EU level;
Improved linkages between Horizon Europe, the CAP and the Green Deal, including its farm to fork and biodiversity strategies through enhancing Agricultural Knowledge and Innovation Systems (AKIS) in the countries and a more efficient European Innovation Partnership (EIP-AGRI) on Agricultural Productivity and Sustainability, bridging the gap between science and practice;
More inclusive SCAR SWGs and CWGs, fostering mutual learning, covering as much as possible all European Member States and Associated Countries and serving the development and implementation of foresight based research and innovation policy strategies on European and national level.
Scope:
The main focus of the successful proposal should be to support the work of the SCAR SWGs and CWGs. This includes notably the organisation and facilitation of the activities, particularly meetings and workshops of SCAR SWGs, CWGs and potential ad hoc task forces, according to the initiatives taken by the Working Groups themselves.
This should in the short- to medium-term improve the quality of outputs of the SCAR SWGs or CWGs in the different areas covered, thus having a positive impact on achieving the objectives of the European Green Deal, the farm to fork strategy, the common agricultural policy, the biodiversity strategy, the wider food systems and bioeconomy research and innovation policies and the Agricultural Knowledge and Innovation Systems in Member States and Associated Countries.
Main activities are the collection of a portfolio of ongoing or finished projects at national, regional and EU level relevant to the various themes covered in the work plans of the SCAR SWGs and CWGs, as well as on other issues that may arise in light of policy developments and priorities. This includes the search, the summarising and analysis of relevant project content and outputs in order to help prepare the activities of each SWG/CWG, including their regular meetings, according to the specific theme(s) covered. This should support the depth of strategic discussions in the Working Groups. At the end of each year, an annual overview document of all portfolios per theme should be made.
Activities should consider the linkages to Horizon Europe partnerships and missions, to Joint Programming Initiatives and ERA-Nets, other relevant policies (e.g. Education policy) and interesting Member States/Associated Countries networking activities. Support for phasing-in of SCAR SWGs or CWGs that may be set up in the future also forms part of the scope. Ad hoc task forces may be used to support specific activities for short time periods.
This proposal should furthermore ensure broader dissemination of the outputs of the SCAR SWGs and CWGs, including the portfolio analysis, to any actor interested in their respective domains, both in classical ways (e.g. with reports, factsheets, videos, workshops, conferences, etc.) as by using up to date IT tools and websites, providing on a case by case basis interactive linkages with the young generation of scientists, innovators and citizens for example by hackathons. These materials and tools should be widely spread and also be made available to the SCAR Steering Group and the SCAR Plenary. It includes helping to prepare the input from the SWGs/CWGs for the SCAR Foresights and to help disseminate outcomes, as well as supporting its take-up by SCAR Working Groups and possible ad hoc task forces, including linking to international R&I partnerships (EU-AU) and processes, such as the UN Food Systems Summit follow-up.
The consortium should be representative of the EU Member States and Associated Countries. Entities in EU Member States and Associated Countries not integrated in the consortium should be identified and the reasons for not participating in the Consortium clearly explained in the proposal. These countries should nevertheless be invited and encouraged to participate in the project activities (e.g. meetings, workshops).
A project duration of 4 years is expected.
This topic should involve the effective contribution of SSH disciplines.

The selected project results are expected to contribute to the following outcomes:
New game changers to provide sustainable diets and nutrition for all, ways to meet the Green Deal targets, establish cross cutting priorities, establish knowledge as a legitimate player/enabler in public debate, accelerate scientific progress, redesign farming systems, cope with unforeseen system shocks, and develop smart diversification.
A food systems transformation, which achieves co-benefits for nutrition and health, climate mitigation and adaptation, environment, biodiversity, circularity, inclusion and overall sustainability.
Novel understanding on how, and to which degree, such a transformation can be catalysed and sustained in the long term, and how the resulting trade-offs can be mitigated.
Knowledge and understanding of how to move towards true cost accounting of food and food systems services that adequately integrate social and environmental externalities and embed environmental accounting (e.g. LCA).
New insights, methods and tools to assess and manage the full systemic complexity of food systems and their multiple drivers, their dynamics and the issues and opportunities that relate to them.
Ways to measure food system performance across all three dimensions of sustainability, which can provide more informed decision and policymaking, and implementation.
An increase in the scientific understanding of food systems, in particular their systemic aspects, as to how they function, and how to transform them for co-benefits and minimised trade-offs.
Engagement of academia and the necessary practitioners in science, innovation and beyond, that can deliver the necessary scientific methodologies and approaches to support policymakers to put complex transformations into practice.
The establishment of a broad interdisciplinary network of researchers, scientists, universities and research centres covering a wide diversity of food systems-related disciplines, as well as those dealing with complex systems, to further systems science in this area.
A strengthened European Research area for food systems transformation for co-benefits
Scope:
This topic should support and strengthen the science, and the science-policy interface relevant to food systems, in particular in relation to delivering on farm to fork and Green Deal policy priorities. Successful proposals are expected to address one of the three inter-connected transformation actions:
Action a) Advance food systems science through:
Mapping of existing food systems and typologies and design of new/existing indicator sets that could be applied at different spatial levels (local to global), with a focus on Europe.
Development of methods and means to assess food system sustainability, such as establishing an overall food systems sustainability score incorporating common agreed Life Cycle Analysis methodologies.
Development of innovative cause-effect simulation models that include all food system sectors and actors beyond the economic focus and which can integrate the three pillars of sustainability to explore the potential impact of different food systems transition options and scenarios delivering co-benefits, while minimising trade-offs.
Providing sound evidence for policy and regulatory science needs to deliver food systems transition towards sustainability; including on how to transition to a true cost of food and food systems services that adequately embed social and environmental externalities relevant to various levels (global to local).
Action b) Contribute to building up a food systems European Research Area – part 1 - through:
Launching new and assessing ongoing food systems foresight activities (building on existing ones including the fifth SCAR Foresight), detecting emerging trends, and delivering early warnings to policy makers and other relevant actors.
Establish a project for policy support capacity to extract, summarise and disseminate findings and achievements of relevant EU Horizon projects and clusters of projects to policy makers, food systems actors and the public.
Perform measurement of, and increase research impact of food system science (for example by assisting scientists to adopt inter and transdisciplinary approaches), and encourage the exchange of scientists for mutual learning and knowledge transfer across disciplines
Foster citizen science in support of food systems transformation by assessing existing attempts, communicating successes, and catalysing new citizen science initiatives across Europe, in particular by engaging with youth, women, and under-represented communities
Action c) Contribute to building up a food systems European Research Area – part 2 – by creating an interdisciplinary pan-European academic network for food system science that integrates the social sciences and humanities, natural science and engineering, and design. This should:
Federate universities, academics and researchers across Europe to support and engage in inter and trans-disciplinary research, foster debate, reflexivity and responsible research and innovation (RRI) in support of food systems transition and improved policymaking at all levels from global to local.
Develop and share freely available open access educational material/curricula to be used by Higher Education Institutes (bachelors and post-graduate levels) to help strengthen their exiting food systems-related teaching and research with an inter and transdisciplinary systems dimension that integrates all three aspects of sustainability, and farm to fork policy and Green Deal priorities.
Support researcher training, mobility, mutual learning and knowledge sharing, and open science approaches.
Disseminate and communicate scientific outcomes adapted for multiple audiences including researchers, policy makers, industry, science media and society. This will also include the organisation of a major international annual/bi-annual conference dedicated to advancing food systems science.
Establish a high-level liaison with EU and relevant international initiatives.
Proposals must involve a wide diversity of food system actors and conducting inter-disciplinary research to implement the required multi actor approach (cf eligibility conditions).
All projects should explain and map how co-benefits should be achieved relevant to the four Food 2030 priorities: nutrition for sustainable healthy diets, climate and environment, circularity and resource efficiency, innovation and empowerment of communities.
All projects should ensure a clustering mechanism with each other and feedback mechanisms with other governance topics and provide general scientific advice for related food systems oriented Horizon Europe projects.
All projects should set out a clear plan on how they should collaborate with other projects selected under this and any other relevant topic/call, by participating in joint activities, workshops, as well as common communication and dissemination activities and channels.

Successful proposals will contribute to the expected impacts of Destination ‘Innovative governance, environmental observations and digital solutions in support of the Green Deal’, and the European policies it supports, in particular the European Green Deal, and EU bioeconomy strategy, by supporting the establishment of the innovative governance models notably to achieve better-informed decision-making processes, social engagement and innovation. In addition, the topic supports the strengthened EU and international science-policy interfaces to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals.
Projects results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:
Creation of a supporting governance structure and related capacities for regional authorities, contributing to the Circular Cities and Regions Initiative (CCRI)[1] and aiming at developing comprehensive and innovation- and sustainability-driven bioeconomy strategies.
Support to local economic and implementing authorities, including at bioeconomy clusters’ level, to improve engagement of regional and local actors, considering hierarchy of use, trade-offs, synergies, business models, participatory approaches etc. with improved environmental, social and economic impacts.
Support to the development of regional/local strategies, aiming at exploiting and developing balanced local potentials and innovation (in terms of feedstock, infrastructures (e.g. biorefineries) for logistics, services and production, investments) within the framework of local development and investment as well as environmental protection plans.
Integration of the opportunities created by the local bio-based economy within broader bioeconomy transition, e.g. by linking ecosystem/nature services’ valorisation with sustainable biomass production, processing, product design and manufacture, circular use and upcycling to new applications.
Development of the best practice guidelines for local operators and innovation developers, supporting climate-neutrality and low environmental footprint improvements of bio-based products and services;
Development of novel business models and related social measures to enable consumers, industry and public bodies to switch to socially and environmentally responsible behaviour within their choices (e.g. regulatory measures, corporate responsibility initiatives, education); ensuring synergies, transparency and inclusiveness of all actors;
Scope:
Improved and informed governance including social innovation contributes to reducing resource consumption and results in an increased innovation capacity of all actors, and reducing the risk of leaving anyone behind. This should take into account the regional and local peculiarities, including feedstock availability, industrial development, consumption patterns, market measures and available investment streams (financial models), while ensuring effective sharing of best practices across European regions. This also helps to advance innovation at local scale and engage all actors.
This action should support the implementation of sustainable bio-based value chains, in regional settings (toolbox of instruments including strategies, plans and programmes, including the social dimension). Proposals should benefit from social creativity and opportunities at regional scale unleashed for bio-based systems, ensuring their low environmental footprint, and providing for its operational verification. Robust environmental protection plans should underpin the effort undertaken.
The local dimension refers to regional scales, in terms of rural/urban/coastal areas, to be identified/defined in their specific characteristics to act as optimal frameworks for coherent and replicable strategies of bio-based systems. The proposals should seek complementarities with related actions[2] on the governance of bio-based innovation and ensure inclusiveness and the engagement of all actors.
Proposals should:
Analyse and structure the regional bioeconomy-related policy mix (e.g. regional operational programmes, bioeconomy strategies under the common agricultural policy instruments, innovation action plans, business models, environmental protection plans) to understand the potentials, bottlenecks, and opportunities, capacities etc. for feedstocks, infrastructure, investment, human skills, innovation actors (including community knowledge) etc. to enable sufficient impacts/benefits/positive trade-offs and performances of the specific bioeconomy/bio-based value chains;
assess existing/develop a new policy monitoring system and key performance indicators of the effectiveness and robustness of existing governance schemes, to allow replication across Europe (e.g. income generation for all stakeholders, labour conditions, environmental indicators, social engagement, innovation parameters etc);
ensure efficient exchange of best practice and engagement of all actors (regional and local authorities, SMEs, civil society organisations including NGOs, knowledge providers) via robust and transparent communication and awareness-rising campaigns;
analyse social and economic barriers and potentialities to enable the transition towards socially and environmentally responsible behaviour within all ranges (e.g. regulatory measures, corporate responsibility initiatives, education), ensuring inclusiveness of all actors (NGOs, civil society etc, considering gender and age, where relevant.)

In line with the European Green Deal’s zero pollution ambition and the Marine Strategy Framework Directive, successful proposals will support the development and implementation of a policy vision and the transition needed to reach clean European seas, cutting across behavioural, social-economic and governance spheres.
Better understanding of major obstacles and showcasing of best practices on the implementation of sustainable and effective marine pollution reduction, prevention, mitigation measures and monitoring (e.g. administrative, legal, financial, technical, social);
Improved support, with a set of guidelines, for the needed blue green transition to reach the policy vision of achieving clean European seas by 2030.
Scope:
To reach the policy vision of achieving clean European seas, a profound transition is needed on how we address and manage marine pollution – a blue green transition. Many national laws, European and international agreements, forbid dumping of harmful materials into the environment, although enforcing these regulations remains a challenge. Proposals should consider all of the following aspects in the move towards this transition: i) encouraging the enforcement of existing or new pollution management related legislation; ii) the incorporation of new circular economy principles (designing materials and processes to enhance the recyclability and reuse of products and wastes e.g. plastics); iii) encouraging responsible chemical-use through consumer and political actions; iv) the definition and uptake of effective sustainability policies e.g. procurement processes – to better capture and uptake green, blue, sustainable, and circular innovations, etc. In summary, this transition embraces all levels e.g. legal, social, economic, industrial[1], environmental and wide range of stakeholders e.g. decision makers, scientists[2], citizens, industry, overall all players behind man-made pollution as well as players that can contribute with solutions (e.g. innovators, procurement experts, service providers etc). Proposals should consider ways for improved cooperation within and across sectors, regions and countries (the ocean and seas do not have borders), improved sharing and integration of information, development of joint measures to achieve zero polluted ocean and seas.
Social innovation is encouraged when the solution is at the socio-technical interface and requires social change, new social practices, social ownership or market uptake. This topic should involve the effective contribution of SSH disciplines.

Successful proposals will set out a credible pathway to contributing to innovative governance and sound decision making in policy for the transition required by the European Green Deal.
Project results are expected to contribute to the following expected outcomes:
Boosting of economic and environmental modelling of land use and management and carbon sequestration in Europe and use of modelling for policy purposes (mainly climate policy, agricultural policy, land use policy).
Contribution to the formulation, implementation and monitoring of land-related issues of agriculture and forestry policies, in particular linked to climate change.
Scope:
To ensure the sustainable management of land resources in the long term there is a need for an integrated framework that addresses society's objectives appropriately by understanding the trade-offs between uses and by incentivising actions / behaviours / investments contributing to desirable targets. Land use and management has a key role to play in Europe in terms of boosting carbon storage, producing biomass for the bioeconomy, reducing urban sprawl and attaining the objective of climate neutrality by 2050 while ensuring food and nutrition security, biodiversity commitments and well-being in general. There are however substantial knowledge gaps regarding, in particular, the understanding of the impacts of farming / forestry practices at various scales, from local to global, and the capacity to model these impacts (economic and environmental). Work should include the analysis of land use dynamics and trends between arable land, permanent grassland, land abandonment / marginal lands, forest areas, for which quantifications and an identification of drivers and impacts should be done in an integrated manner.
Projects should:
work on land use dynamics and explore the effects of policy measures that can influence such dynamics, in particular agricultural, land use and climate policies.
focus activities mainly on agriculture and forest land use/cover and should extend to interactions of the former with other main land uses/covers and drivers. This should ensure usability of the results in larger contexts. While focusing on Europe, proposals are encouraged to draw on good examples from elsewhere.
work at various spatial scales – farm level, regional to EU levels - and simulations and projections should range from medium-term to long-term policy scenarios and should cover the whole of the EU and its Member States and possibly Associated Countries.
The possible participation of the JRC in the projects will ensure that the proposed approach will be compatible with and/or improve existing databases and tools used at the European Commission and ensure open access to data.
include a task to collaborate with other projects financed under this topic and under topic HORIZON-CL6-2021-GOVERNANCE-01-12 “EU agriculture within a safe and just operating space and planetary boundaries”.

The successful proposals will support tracing environmental impacts along value chains and trades in the bio-based systems for business-to-business communication to enable responsible production and consumption, in line with the 2030 Climate Target Plan and the zero pollution ambition. Project outcomes will contribute to establish circular bio-based systems reversing climate change, restoring biodiversity and protecting air, soil and water quality along supply chain of biological resources and industrial value chains, within the EU and across borders.
Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:
Bio-based value chains transparency in international and EU trade is enhanced through business-to-business labels of biological resources and bio-based materials and products.
Harmonization of existing international and EU certification scheme and the monitoring system and indicators of their effectiveness and robustness.
Scope:
Climate neutral circular bio-based systems have the potential to establish a zero-pollution economy provided that they are developed sustainably. Environmental, social and economic impacts and trade-offs should be traced along value chains and trades to enable responsible production and consumption. Activities under this topic should assess scope, potential and requirements of international and EU sustainability certification schemes and business-to-business labels applicable to biological resources including primary biomass resources and bio-waste and residues intended for bio-based industrial value-chains and to bio-based materials and products, also in complementarity with actions on bio-based innovation and market measures. Industrial bio-based systems do not include food/feed, biofuels, bioenergy and cultural/recreation sectors. However, relevant initiatives in the field of assessment and certification of environmental sustainability arising from EU policies in the bioeconomy sectors should be taken into account. Traceability of biological resources and bio-based materials and products on a business-to-business level, at the EU and the global scale, should be part of certification, including aspects on primary and secondary biomass and bio-based intermediates in global trade flows and imports into the EU.
Proposals should:
Review and analyse existing international and EU sustainability certification schemes and business-to-business labels for biological resources. The analysis should encompass schemes applied/applicable to biological resources intended for industrial bio-based value chains. Certified environmental, social and economic impacts and trade-offs should be analysed. Bio-waste and any biological secondary raw materials from rural/urban/industrial activities are included in the definition of biological resources.
Collect data and figures on volumes of biological resources and bio-based materials and products in global trade flows and imports into (exports from) the EU and their geographic distribution, distinguishing between certified and uncertified resources and materials/products. The data collection should be based on existing and consolidated market databases.
Review and analyse existing international and EU sustainability certification schemes and business-to-business labels for bio-based materials and products with the same level of detail apply to the analysis of resources (point a).
Assess existing/develop new monitoring system and indicators of effectiveness and robustness of existing certification schemes and labels reviewed in point a) and c). The task should consider the life cycle analysis perspective and identify minimum requirements of a certification scheme to ensure its completeness covering environmental, social and economic aspects.
Demonstrate/test effectiveness of existing (voluntary) certification schemes and labels and monitor their robustness; this action includes testing the monitoring system and indicators assessed/developed within the project, point d, on the reviewed schemes, point a) and c). The results should consolidate the optimal monitoring system and indicators and provide a preliminary selection of (parts of) the certification schemes covering the minimum requirements identified in point d). The same for labels.
Assess costs from the adoption of certification schemes and labels in selected industrial bio-based value-chains. The assessment includes selecting a range of value-chains in the EU and Associated Countries and the corresponding biological resources and flows of materials and products among those certified and reviewed in point a and c and collecting data and figures on the known costs: actual economic and internalised environmental and social ones. The evaluation of the externalised environmental and social costs should be part of the overall assessment, based either on primary data or/and on models taken from peer-reviewed literature in the related fields of economy, social and environmental sciences.
Evaluate the feasibility of business-to-business labels that award best performances either of resources or material or products from either environmental or social aspects. The feasibility should include modelled economic costs and benefits.
Analyse and develop recommendations on how to promote the best practices in the adoption of effective and robust certification schemes and business-to-business labels. Promoting actions may include deployment and take-up by industrial sectors of certification schemes, building trust between business stakeholders, deploying corporate responsibility, engagement with and awareness of bio-based sectors.
Engage in cooperation with international partners and organisations, to increase impact and outreach, while ensuring sufficient focus on the EU’s situation.

Deadline date","ExpectedOutcome:
Successful proposals will set out a credible pathway to contributing to innovative governance and sound decision making in policy for the transition of European agriculture required by the European Green Deal.
Project results are expected to contribute to the following expected outcomes:
Boost EU and Associated Countries analytical and modelling capacity in agriculture in both bio-physical and socio-economic domains
Develop an analytical and policy framework and timeframe for the European farming sector to operate within safe and just operating space and planetary boundaries and achieving EU climate change policy objectives
Analyse policies and develop policy recommendations for the agricultural policies in Europe in 2030
Scope:
In order to enable the transition to sustainable agriculture, it is crucial to establish the necessary policy framework and related monitoring and evaluation activities. This implies the development of appropriate tools for measurement and monitoring of socio-economic and biophysical data in order to model and project scenarios and derive the necessary targets, trajectories and relevant policy measures and the development of relevant analysis.
Projects should:
operationalise the concept of safe and just operating space, including planetary boundaries, in the case of the EU agriculture and at different spatial scales;
boost the analytical and modelling capacity of the EU and Associated Countries in the farming sector with a view to informing impact assessments and formulating policy recommendations, with a particular focus on conditions and policy measures for the EU farming sector to respect planetary boundaries, in particular regarding climate change and biodiversity, and safe and just operating space;
work at various geographical scales, from local, national, EU to global levels, and simulations and projections should range from short / medium term (to capture the accelerating impact of climate change) to long term policy scenarios;
Within a foresight exercise, develop post-2027 science-based targets for European farming allowing the sector to remain within the planetary boundaries and a safe and just operating space, and the conditions to achieve the targets, and develop a roadmap and the related policy framework to reach those objectives;
mobilise running Horizon 2020 projects and build on their main results. It should aim to bridge gaps in modelling approaches relevant to the exercise, including those identified by the Horizon 2020 project Suprema. Projects should link in particular with the projects financed under RUR-03-2018 (CONSOLE[1], Contract2.0[2] and EFFECT[3]) and RUR-04-2018-2019 (Mind Step[4], BESTMAP[5] and AGRICORE[6]);
include a task to collaborate with other projects financed under this topic and under topic HORIZON-CL6-2021-GOVERNANCE-01-13 “Modelling land use and land management in the context of climate change”;
work in a multidisciplinary manner and involve a broad community of scientists including climate, land, biodiversity, health, human, economic and environment sciences;
establish a regular dialogue with the European Commission regarding objectives, timeline and main deliverables with the goal to provide analyses, analytical tools, simulations and policy recommendations for the common agricultural policy (CAP) post 2027, as well as other relevant EU programmes (for instance EU climate and biodiversity policies). The possible participation of the JRC in the project will ensure that the approach proposed will be compatible with and improve the tools used at the European Commission. Project duration should not be shorter than four years;
ensure that the proposed approach will be compatible with and improve the tools used at the European Commission.
As an option, necessary additional analysis and modelling may be supported through grants to third parties. In this case, the proposal must define the process of selecting entities for which financial support will be granted, of up to 60.000 EUR per third party. Grants to third parties may be utilised to ensure a comprehensive coverage of technical issues and the participation of pluralistic approaches to the analytical work on a series of key issues.

","single-stage
Deadline date","ExpectedOutcome:
This action will enhance the sustainability performance and competitiveness in the domains covered by Cluster 6 through further deployment of digital and data technologies as key enablers. It will help to achieve better informed decision-making processes, social engagement, governance and innovation. It will help deliver solutions to advance the European Green Deal priorities, the EU's Climate ambition for 2030 and 2050 and the farm to fork strategy for a fair healthy and environmentally friendly food system. In particular, it will contribute to improving the data economy for food systems.
Project results are expected to contribute to all of the expected outcomes:
address the lack of solid knowledge about the data economy in food systems, its development, its fairness and inclusiveness, and its impacts including on EU policy objectives such as those related to food and nutrition security (FNS), sustainable and resilient food systems[1], climate change, health, competitiveness, fair trading practices, privacy, and consumer protection
increase insights in the state-of-play, the actual and potential impacts (positive and negative), the drivers, barriers and enablers of digital transformation, its fairness and inclusiveness
accelerate the positive impacts of the digital transformation, and broaden the group of citizens, communities, companies and other food system stakeholders that benefit from it.
Scope:
Data driven innovation is fast reshaping the way we produce and consume food. It enhances the potential to manage natural resources more efficiently and to care for the ecosystems that our food production relies on without exceeding finite boundaries. It improves the transparency of our food systems, processes and products from farm to fork, enables a more resilient, safe, circular and customised supply and more personalised diets. It motivates policy-makers, regulators and researchers to make better use of data for monitoring and for generating new insights.
Proposals should gather expertise from a broad range of disciplines and food system participants to obtain new insights and achieve a deepened and more comprehensive understanding of the data economy for food systems. New insights and understanding should relate to the data economy’s structure, its functioning, its present and potential development and its performance versus relevant EU policy objectives, as a basis for future policy recommendations, improved governance and monitoring.
The research that is conducted should therefore go well beyond technology insights and include a holistic assessment of the state-of-play of the data economy, data driven innovation and data reuse[2] in EU food systems, of the drivers, barriers and enablers of digital transformation, and of ongoing and expected trends, including behavioural. Proposals should assess actual and expected impacts (positive and negative) of this transformation on the performance of EU food systems versus the 3 dimensions of sustainability and versus relevant EU policy objectives, including “the European Green Deal” (and therein “the EU Farm-to-Fork Strategy”), an “Economy that works for people” and “a Europe fit for the digital age”. In their assessment of impact, proposals should include a review of the inclusiveness of the ongoing digital transformation in EU food systems (e.g. participation of micro-companies and SMEs, role of gender), and study the fairness of the data economy (e.g. presence of power asymmetries based on data holdings, unfair competition and practices, fair distribution of added value among actors, empowerment of consumers, including the most vulnerable). Proposals will perform 5-10 detailed end-to-end case studies of data flows and reuse in specific parts of our food systems, from farm to fork.
Proposals will put in place a broad stakeholder dialogue to facilitate and discuss new insights, to boost mutual learning and cooperation, to increase awareness among policy makers and stakeholder representatives about the benefits and pitfalls of digital transformation, and to generate new ideas and approaches to improve governance of the data economy in food systems. The stakeholder dialogue should attract and involve players from all parts of the data value chain and representing different sectors and markets. Special care should be taken to involve SMEs, young entrepreneurs, young farmers, start-ups, cities and consumers, and to include relevant actors that are not directly linked to the food value chains (e.g. social media companies, knowledge brokers, educators).
Proposals should develop a framework for the data economy in food systems, as a basis for monitoring its future development, its performance and impacts.
Proposals should formulate recommendations (including technological, societal, economic, legal) for policy makers (EU, national, regional, local) and other stakeholders. They should do this with a view to accelerating the uptake of data driven innovation and data reuse in a socially acceptable way and to improving the development, functioning, governance, monitoring, impact and fairness of the data economy in food systems, within the context of overall EU policy objectives. These recommendations should also take into account trends and opportunities[3] that the research identified, that are expected to be important drivers of change in food systems, and for which improved governance, adapted legal frameworks, new policy initiatives and enhanced societal engagement (from citizen science to prosumer approaches) can significantly increase the positive and mitigate the negative impacts of future changes. This includes efforts to explain and map how the recommendations generate co-benefits for the four Food 2030 priorities: nutrition for sustainable healthy diets, climate and environment, circularity and resource efficiency, innovation and empowerment of communities.
These recommendations should also address the need for more (and more effective) exchange and reuse of data assets across parts of EU food systems, national boundaries and language barriers, public and private sectors, and for a wider adoption of data driven-innovations. They should also help to mitigate power asymmetries based on data holdings, ensure fairer competition in the data economy, maximise benefits for citizens and food system actors and enable more open access to data. More specifically, an EU data space for Food systems, in which data is shared for the common good (“data commons”), should be examined to support the objectives of the EU Farm-to-Fork Strategy. Integration of such a data space, with the European Open Science Cloud, the common European data space for research and innovation, should aim at allowing the research community to create new knowledge in this domain.
Proposals should set out a clear plan on how they plan to collaborate with other projects selected under this and any other relevant call, by participating in joint activities, workshops, as well as common communication and dissemination activities.
This topic should involve the effective contribution of SSH disciplines.

This topic aims at supporting activities that are enabling or contributing to one or several expected impacts of destination 4 “Ensuring access to innovative, sustainable and high-quality health care”. To that end, proposals under this topic should aim for delivering results that are directed at, tailored towards and contributing to some of the following expected outcomes:
Health care organisations and policymakers adopt robust and transparent modelling (including data collection, storage and analysis), planning algorithms and artificial intelligence (AI) solutions in support of health care decision-making processes;
Health care providers, caregivers (formal and informal), citizens, and other relevant stakeholders take better informed decisions about their health or the health of persons they are responsible for and/or about the organisation of the health care service or system they are involved in or in charge of;
Health system owners are provided with evidence-based participative decision-making processes that take into consideration all relevant values, needs and perspectives, enabling to deliver health care services to patients in the most suitable and efficient manner;
Policymakers access evidence-based, interoperable decision support tools for public health policy-making and health care delivery.
Scope:
This call topic will contribute to Europe’s Beating Cancer Plan activities[1] and other relevant initiatives such as the European Cancer Information System[2]. For this reason, proposals must focus on one or more phases of the cycle of the disease, starting from prevention and early diagnosis to treatment and quality of life of patients and survivors.
An ever-increasing amount of data is at the disposal of decision- and policy-makers, which, if analysed, pooled and used, could lead to novel data-driven approaches in health care delivery and policy-making, thus improving quality of life, health equity and producing better health outcomes. The collection, access, processing, and (primary and secondary) use of data is still very fragmented across national health systems. The availability and use of structured and unstructured health data represents an opportunity for the implementation of data-driven innovation and it provides new opportunities for developing, monitoring and evaluating decisions, and providing feedback into decision-making processes and policy strategies.
In this topic, research and innovation actions should aim at optimising and/or transforming health care delivery decision-making processes, supporting policy-making, and/or empowering citizens and cancer patients. The development of innovations, including tools, processes and services, should be done together with end-users (i.e. citizens, health professionals and policymakers), and represent both a support-base and scientific evidence for data-driven innovation. Design thinking and other relevant design methodologies should be considered.
The proposals should adhere to the FAIR data[3] principles and adopt data quality standards, data integration operating procedures and GDPR-compliant data sharing/access best practices developed by the European research infrastructures, if relevant. In addition, the proposals are encouraged to adopt best practices of international standards used in the development of computational models.
Data-driven algorithms should be explainable, unbiased and inclusive. Caution needs to be paid to systematically control for gender and racial bias and/or discrimination bias, when developing and using data and algorithms. The actions should ensure that the novel ideas are accompanied by frameworks/guidelines for new forms of collaboration and incentivising mechanisms/tools in order to support implementation of the innovations in the public sector. The tools should aim to improve health outcomes and quality of life, not only to lower health care costs.
Actions should pursue a multi-disciplinary and multi-stakeholder approach to integrate health care research, health services research, innovation, health economics, implementation science, operations management/research, data science and other relevant disciplines (i.e. sociology and anthropology) to ensure more equitable, innovative and sustainable health care systems.
Applicants should propose activities underpinned by health care data in one or more of the following areas:
The development of data-driven, interactive policy and visualisation tools (i.e. through creation of digital twins/virtual models) bringing novel insights on populations, systems and services as a whole, to help policymakers make data-driven decisions. These can be foreseen to be used solely for health care decisions or constitute health-relevant inputs for other sectorial approaches, and promote multi-disciplinary knowledge exchange;
The development of data-driven solutions (i.e scenario-building tools and models) helping health care organisations take evidence-informed decisions on cancer care delivery processes such as logistics planning and management, capacity, utilisation of health services and allocation of resources and infrastructures (i.e. human resources, health goods, etc.), and availability of and access to health care technologies (i.e. pharmaceuticals, vaccines, medical devices, etc.) and interventions;
The development of data-driven solutions empowering citizens' and cancer patients' interaction with the health care systems, including feedback mechanisms, guidance on health care pathways and on managing health care data, supporting patients in making health care decisions and treatment adherence;
The development of digital toolkits and indicators to improve the reporting and assessment of outputs from end-user involvements, including those of patient-reported outcomes measures (PROMs) and patient-reported experience measures (PREMs), and help gauge the actual impact in health care (including interaction between patients and health care providers).
Applicants are encouraged to establish dynamic relations and synergies with the following areas, where applicable:
Decision-making processes and tools, including social innovation;
Monitoring and evaluating the budgetary impact of health care interventions (i.e. innovative solutions, digital services and health care models);
Health technology assessment and cost-effectiveness analysis;
Artificial intelligence/deep learning tools in social medicine to determine causal factors of disease/conditions and develop interventions;
Data sharing between different institutions;
European Health Data Space (EHDS);
Open source and/or common building blocks used in Connecting Europe Facility (CEF) (e.g. eDelivery, eID);
Standards and mechanisms to allow for interoperability between primary and secondary use of data;
Privacy-preserving protocols for secondary use of data for public health policy-making and research;
Federated/distributed access or data processing protocols for data-driven decision-support tools for better health care delivery and policy-making.
Proposals should adopt a patient-centred approach that empowers patients, promotes a culture of dialogue and openness between citizens/patients, caregivers, health care providers and other relevant stakeholders, and unleashes the potential for social innovation.
Whenever the data sources proposed to be used by the applicants include genomics data, the proposals should consider the data standards and legal, ethical and technical interoperability requirements and guidelines agreed under the 1+ Million Genomes Initiative[4] where relevant.
If projects use satellite-based earth observation, positioning, navigation and/or related timing data and services, beneficiaries must make use of Copernicus and/or Galileo/EGNOS (other data and services may additionally be used).

This topic aims at supporting activities that are enabling or contributing to one or several expected impacts of destination 4 “Ensuring access to innovative, sustainable and high-quality health care”. To that end, proposals under this topic should aim for delivering results that are directed, tailored towards and contributing to all of the following expected outcomes:
Stakeholders involved in the demand side of health and social care innovations (such as procurement agencies, health care providers, payers/health insurers, public authorities, health care professionals, citizens) reach a common understanding that reflects their key clinical, procurement/supply, organisational and coordination priorities.
Public/private procurers and decision makers at a local, regional, national and EU level collectively develop and adopt optimal, cost-efficient and flexible innovation procurement strategies, taking into account the ongoing changes in the organisational procedures of health care structures caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.
Procurers and decision makers in procurement organisations mainstream health care-related Innovation Procurement best practices in their respective policy and investment strategies.
Health care procurers from participating Member States and associated countries scale up cross-border collaborations in research and deployment of innovative solutions, thereby minimising investment risks.
Scope:
This call aims to support the creation of a network of public[1] and private procurers that are responsible for deploying health care innovations across the EU, in order to identify potential areas of interest for innovation procurement.
Health care stakeholders on the demand side can address their clinical or organisational challenges through networking and the coordinated use of innovation procurement tools and policies. A network’s scale, internal transfer of knowledge and engagement with external stakeholders in health, research and industry would facilitate the development of a holistic approach in innovation procurement and an increased collective capacity to procure solutions, which improve health outcomes for patients in inclusive, flexible and fiscally sustainable ways.
This network should assemble a critical mass of European procurers with a strong track record, processes and resources for deploying innovative solutions in health and social care, as well as less experienced ones (due, for example, to budget constraints, lack of expertise or language barriers) who are interested to venture into this area. Through collaboration, experience sharing and in particular through twinning activities, the network should offer the opportunity to less experienced procurers in health innovation to build up capacity on innovation procurement. To this aim, beneficiaries may provide financial support to third parties. This support can only be given in the form of grants and the maximum amount to be granted to each third party is EUR 60 000. The respective options of the Model Grant Agreement will apply. Beneficiaries should refer to General Annex B of the Work Programme for further information and guidance.
These goals are particularly relevant in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, which highlighted issues such as the timing, financing and coordination of cross-border/emergency procurement in the EU, supply chain diversity and security, as well as the benefits of digital solutions for patients, health professionals and citizens. The ongoing pandemic has demonstrated that new critical challenges for health care systems may arise in the future, which will need to be addressed properly and swiftly, sometimes with innovative tools and flexible approaches.
The proposals should present a credible plan for a network, which will:
Create a sustainable mechanism for decision-makers in the health and social care sector to enable and facilitate the use of Innovation Procurement as a tool to tackle current and future challenges faced by the procurers involved;
Develop a holistic innovation procurement action plan for key health care challenges ahead, that is adaptable to the procurement strategies of most public organizations in the health care sector in Europe and covering all stages of Innovation Procurement implementation (from the identification of a need and pre-tender market consultation, until evaluation of the procurement’s impact);
Set the ground for mainstreaming (cross-border) Innovation Procurement implementation in Europe’s health sector (EU-funded or not), by engaging, in an appropriate way, other key stakeholders, such as patients, industry (including SMEs/start-ups), policymakers (local, regional and/or national authorities) or investors (e.g. private investors, National Promotional Banks and Economic Development Agencies etc.).
Applicant consortia should be composed primarily of public and/or private procurers, dealing with or interested in the purchase of health care innovations. Consortia may also include health authorities or innovation procurement competence centres, which support these health care procurers in implementing innovation procurement[2]. The composition of the applicant consortia should ensure a broad and balanced geographical representation of Member States and Associated Countries.
Proposals should not promote a silo mentality but should interconnect different types of procurers with their counterparts in other countries across Europe and with the wider healthcare/eHealth ecosystem and an enlarged group of stakeholders critical to the success of Innovation Procurement activities. Applicants should demonstrate that they have the mandate and capacity to procure and can engage key decision-makers from their organisation (e.g. procurement departments, clinical, academic and research departments) who would provide the backbone for such an innovation procurement policy and coordination mechanism to operate effectively (e.g. leverage funds and external expertise, recruit stakeholders, develop/adapt strategies, provide policy recommendations, facilitate emergency procurement procedures).
Proposals should include all of the following aspects:
Hold an open market consultation with the industry across Europe on the current state of the art for the shared unmet needs for innovative solutions identified by the procurers, including on technical and service readiness;
Develop capacity and cooperation models for implementing Innovation Procurement (in the form of Innovation Partnerships, PCP/PPI or other relevant instruments), which overcome potential differences among the legal public procurement frameworks of the participating procurers in health and social care;
Conduct a user analysis of Innovation Procurement, identify barriers and propose solutions to overcome these barriers (e.g.: standardisation, certification, regulatory requirements, intellectual property rights, contracting models, payment/reimbursement models) and facilitate uptake of such solutions;
Plan for procurement(s) based on identified common needs;
Take measures ensuring the sustainability of outcomes beyond the lifespan of the proposed project and their integration into the procurement strategies of participating organisations, taking into account acceptance with users and professionals as well as health economics considerations.

This topic aims at supporting activities that are enabling or contributing to one or several expected impacts of destination 4 “Ensuring access to innovative, sustainable and high-quality health care”. To that end, proposals under this topic should aim for delivering results that are directed, tailored towards and contributing to some of the following expected outcomes:
Health policymakers use context specific knowledge and evidence to develop inclusive, effective and affordable interventions ensuring patient safety;
Health care professionals know how to prevent, identify, evaluate and address risks for patient safety, and use harmonised or standardised patient-centred procedures and practice guidelines for improving patient safety developed in partnership with empowered patients;
Health care providers integrate harmonised and standardised practices with personalised treatment schemes;
Health care providers use quality assured processes to bridge inter-sectorial gaps in the clinical pathways of patients to improve patient safety;
An increased number of health care professionals and patients/citizens adhere to recommendations for improved patient safety.
Scope:
Patient safety remains an issue of increasing concern for EU health systems. The Commission estimates that between 8% and 12% of patients admitted to hospitals in the EU suffer from adverse effects of health care[1].
Overall, the most common types of in-hospital adverse effects are operative/surgical related, medication or drug related, and health care associated infections, half of them being preventable[2]. According to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), more than 7 million admissions in the OECD countries result from safety lapses in primary and ambulatory care[3]. Diagnostic errors persist throughout all settings of care and contribute to increased risks and harms from the treatment[4]. Therefore, it is necessary to develop and implement coherent quality improvement and patient safety strategies in Europe. Harmonisation and standardisation of health care processes (Guidelines and Standard Operating Procedures) along the continuum of care contribute to improve quality and safety of health services, minimise the risk of errors and at the same time ensure the quality and comparability of health data. It is also a mean to address inequities in health care delivery.
The proposals should take into consideration the already existing EU-funded initiatives in this area and must address in a coherent manner at least three of the following items, but may also contain other research and innovations activities for improving patient safety:
Fill knowledge and practice gaps in quality of care and patient safety, including through harmonisation and standardisation of health care delivery, optimizing inter-sectoral clinical pathways and decision-making processes and tools across regions and countries.
Development and piloting of harmonised evidence-based interventions in a uniform and structured way in health care institutions of different EU regions and countries. This should be addressed in case studies at hospital, primary and outpatient care levels, and it should also take into consideration the diverse health care landscape across European Union and Associated Countries.
Research on translation of international standards and clinical guidelines into national practice for improved quality of care and patient safety.
Provide context-specific evidence on facilitators and barriers for transferring identified good practices across regions and countries.
Comprehensive comparison of practices related to clinical guidelines in European Union and Associated Countries, including the regulatory basis underpinning guidelines in each health system, the guideline development process, mechanisms of quality control, implementation modalities, and evaluation of produced recommendations.
Development of innovative approaches for the integration of harmonised and standardised practices with personalised treatment plans.
Proposals should consider a patient-centred approach that empowers patients/citizens, promotes a culture of dialogue and openness between health professionals and citizens/ patients, and unleashes the potential for social innovation.
The proposals should contribute to improved patient safety along the continuum of care in European Union and Associated Countries. The proposal should present a clear strategy for empowering and involving patients and caregivers in addressing the selected item(s), giving attention to both PROMs (Patient-Reported Outcome Measures) and PREMs (Patient-Reported Experience Measures). The research design, including the expected results, should carefully analyse and tackle the sex and gender dimension. The proposed evidence-based interventions, including clinical guidelines and standards, should meet health care providers’ needs and goals to increase patient safety and health care quality.
All projects funded under this topic are strongly encouraged to participate in networking and joint activities, as appropriate. These networking and joint activities could, for example, involve the participation in joint workshops, the exchange of knowledge, the development and adoption of best practices, or joint communication activities. This could also involve networking and joint activities with projects funded under other clusters and pillars of Horizon Europe, or other EU programmes, as appropriate. Therefore, proposals are expected to include a budget for the attendance to regular joint meetings and may consider to cover the costs of any other potential joint activities without the prerequisite to detail concrete joint activities at this stage. The details of these joint activities will be defined during the grant agreement preparation phase. In this regard, the Commission may take on the role of facilitator for networking and exchanges, including with relevant stakeholders, if appropriate.

This topic aims at supporting activities that are enabling or contributing to one or several expected impacts of destination 3 “Tackling diseases and reducing disease burden”. To that end, proposals under this topic should aim for delivering results that are directed, tailored towards and contributing to all of the following expected outcomes:
All stakeholders along the health care value chain dispose of enhanced knowledge of risk factors, symptoms expression, disease progression and clinical outcomes in relation to host and viral characteristics, and host-pathogen interaction (i.e., the mechanistic understanding of the interplay between host and virus).
Clinicians, regulators and other stakeholders along the health care value chain have access to decision support based on characterized diversity of host response at the level of genetic patterns, molecular pathways and physiological mechanisms, in relation to a large number of variables that inform disease predisposition, disease progression, symptoms expression and clinical outcomes.
Clinicians and researchers use information on the deep characterization of the dynamics of the immune responses to the chosen virus(es), identifying factors critical for viral control and immune protection. This will provide a robust and common evidence base for the development of personalised therapeutic interventions and vaccines in the future.
Clinicians use biomarkers[1] in the broad sense for personalised patient management.
Clinicians and other stakeholders along the healthcare value chain have access to and use guidance on preventive measures and for the early identification of patients at risk of developing severe symptoms.
Scope:
Proposals are expected to characterize the host response and host-pathogen interaction to a virus (or viruses) at the level of genetic patterns, physiological mechanisms and molecular pathways involving different organs and systems to identify factors that predispose to different clinical symptoms, different progression of the viral disease and different clinical outcomes. The study should include patient follow-up to identify conditions (including long-term ones) that may appear after the patient has recovered from the viral disease.
In all cases, actions should cover deep immunological phenotyping of the host response, including the use of animal models or in-vitro models if relevant. The latter should cover the dynamics of the innate and adaptive immune responses to the chosen virus(es) (comprising immunity duration, the effect of potential subsequent infections, etc.) including, if relevant, the association of HLA assets of patients with protective or harmful immune responses. Ultimately, this research should inform disease progression and the development of personalised prophylactic and therapeutic strategies.
The analysis should address the effect of differences in age, sex, gender, ethnicity, chronic conditions, co-morbidities, treatments offered and other relevant characteristics. The sample should be geographically representative for Europe. Where relevant, the sample could also include the data of subjects from outside Europe.
The data used should be standardized following the best available international practices and standards. Equally, sample collection and processing should be done following recognised standard operating procedures. All data should be treated in accordance with GDPR and ethical principles.
Proposals that focus on COVID-19 are strongly encouraged to build links with the EU-funded project ORCHESTRA[2]. Proposals should pay special attention and link to the newly established European COVID-19 data sharing platform[3] and collaborate with the existing network of COVID-19 projects[4] funded under Horizon 2020.
Proposals could consider the involvement of the European Commission's Joint Research Centre (JRC) on modelling the pathogenesis of COVID-19 using Adverse Outcome Pathways.
Collaboration with other relevant initiatives, such as the International Consortium for Personalised Medicine (ICPerMed)[5], the 1+ Million Genomes initiative[6] and the EBrains[7] research infrastructure is encouraged, where relevant. Whenever the proposed data sources or fields of application include genomics, the proposals should consider the data standards, and legal, ethical and technical interoperability requirements and guidelines agreed within the 1+ Million Genomes initiative where relevant.

This topic aims at supporting activities that are enabling or contributing to one or several expected impacts of destination 2 ‘Living and working in a health-promoting environment’. To that end, proposals under this topic should aim for delivering results that are directed, tailored towards and contributing to all of the following expected outcomes:
Public authorities and regulators are supported with scientific evidence to implement the Council Recommendation 1999/519/EC on the limitation of exposure of the general public to electromagnetic fields (0 Hz to 300 GHz) as well as Directive 2013/35/EU on the minimum health and safety requirements regarding the exposure of workers to the risks arising from physical agents (electromagnetic fields), in particular the implementation of article 1.4 of the Directive, as well as the most recent ICNIRP guidelines[1] for limiting exposure to electromagnetic fields;
Public authorities improve their risk assessment, management and communication through access to FAIR[2] data and robust evidence on the exposure to EMF, in particular for the new generation radio-communication networks (e.g. 5G networks), and on the causal links between level and duration of exposures and health effects;
Public authorities and the scientific community take advantage of novel and robust methodologies, including models, for the assessment of health impact of exposures;
Stakeholders consistently use quality criteria and standards (CEN/ISO[3]) for the analytical methodologies in the assessment of exposure to EMF, including 5G, and their impact on human health and on the environment;
Public authorities, employers and citizens rely on practical guidelines for exposure prevention and reduction;
Citizens are effectively engaged and informed about the health impact of EMF exposures and risk-preventing behaviours.
Scope:
Digital technologies and electronic communication services are a critical enabler for attaining the sustainability goals of the European Green Deal in many different sectors. The use of the new generation radio-communication networks, e.g. 5G (the fifth generation of mobile phone technology), promise higher data transfer rates and increased network capacity compared with previous generations. While digitalisation presents new opportunities, e.g. distance monitoring of air and water pollution and health outcomes, it also presents potential health risks. Europe needs a digital sector that puts sustainability at its heart: when deploying new technologies, the potential risks related to human health should also be assessed, in addition to the significant benefits.
There has been an exponential increase in the use of wireless personal communication devices (mobile phones, WiFi or Bluetooth-enabled devices etc.) by almost all citizens in private and professional settings and in the supporting infrastructures. The number of other applications using EMF has also increased such as security scanners, smart meters and medical equipment. This has resulted in an increase in man-made electromagnetic radiation in our surroundings.
The International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP) issues guidelines for limiting exposure to electric, magnetic and electromagnetic fields. EU member states are subject to Council Recommendation 1999/519/EC and the Directive 2013/35/EU, which follow basic rules on EMF exposure evaluation provided by ICNIRP guidelines. Nevertheless, there is some concern over the possible impact on health and safety from potentially higher exposure to EMF, e.g. arising from the deployment of 5G technology. Increased exposure may result from, for instance, the additional use of higher frequencies, and from the potential aggregation of different signals, especially in cities.
Research actions under this topic should provide forward-looking information on potential hazards and risks of existing and emerging EMF exposures through innovative monitoring techniques, experimental evidence and modelling and should include all of the following activities:
Monitoring of exposures of the general population and specific groups at risk such as children and workers using innovative technologies;
Establishment of potentially new exposure patterns and comparison with existing patterns, e.g. those generated by the use of previous generations of mobile phone technologies. It should be documented how exposures to EMF changes over time due to the introduction of new technologies, including 5G, supporting infrastructure, radiofrequency bands, modulation techniques and applications;
Investigating evidence of local and systemic biological effects and health impacts across the lifecycle using in vitro and in vivo approaches, respecting the 3Rs[4] principle, and taking into account combined exposures and changing patterns of device use;
Delivering FAIR[5] data on the causal links between level and duration of exposures and potential health (biological) effects, including potential mechanisms, in living and working environments, considering also vulnerable groups, particularly children;
Proposing new quality criteria and standards (CEN/ISO[6]) for the analytical methodologies used for the assessment of exposure to EMF and their impact on human health and on the environment;
Undertaking case studies on solutions for exposure reduction based on acquired evidence and deliver practical guidelines for exposure prevention along the stakeholder chain;
Proposing and testing efficient communication methods and tools for engaging citizens in preventive actions and addressing their concerns.
Aspects such as gender, age, regional variations, socio-economics and culture should be considered, where appropriate.
All projects funded under this topic are strongly encouraged to participate in networking and joint activities, as appropriate. These networking and joint activities could, for example, involve the participation in joint workshops, the exchange of knowledge, the development and adoption of best practices, or joint communication activities. This could also involve networking and joint activities with projects funded under other clusters and pillars of Horizon Europe, or other EU programmes, as appropriate. Therefore, proposals are expected to include a budget for the attendance to regular joint meetings and may consider to cover the costs of any other potential joint activities without the prerequisite to detail concrete joint activities at this stage. The details of these joint activities will be defined during the grant agreement preparation phase. In this regard, the Commission may take on the role of facilitator for networking and exchanges, including with relevant stakeholders, if appropriate.

To that end, proposals under this topic should aim for delivering results that are directed, tailored towards and contributing to all of the following expected outcomes:
Public authorities, consumer protection entities and patient associations have access to FAIR[1] data on air pollutants, including both chemical and microbiological determinants, and their main sources for relevant and representative indoor environments and settings in Europe;
Society has access to user-friendly solutions to monitor indoor air quality, a knowledge base of risk factors associated to human health impacts related to the main indoor air determinants and guidelines for interventions to improve air quality;
Policy-makers are provided with proposals for revised indoor air quality standards for the main determinants identified to support regulatory measures and improve regulatory monitoring;
The Zero-Pollution Action Plan of the European Green Deal is supported by science-based evidence.
Scope:
Air quality is primarily monitored in outdoor locations, often for regulatory targets compliance purposes. However, people spend the majority of their lives in indoor environments: e.g. at home, in the workplace, in schools and inside transport vehicles. Whereas improving outdoor air quality leads to general improvements of indoor air quality as well, certain sources of air pollution not covered by ambient air quality standards can dominate in some indoor environments. In the current pandemic situation, the issue of good indoor air quality has become even more prominent, encompassing issues such as the need of good ventilation of indoor spaces.
In addition to identifying determinants for indoor air quality, it is important to assess their health impacts in the levels reached indoors to facilitate setting of purposeful indoor air quality standards. The mere presence of a determinant may not mean harmful health effects and some (biological) determinants may even have beneficial health effects.
Applicants should propose research actions that advance the understanding of the indoor air quality and related health and safety issues and should include all of the following activities:
Identification and characterisation of sources and routes of exposure and dispersion of chemical and biological indoor air pollution, e.g. indoor air microbiome and allergens, viral pathogens, household chemicals, biocides in building materials, particulate matter, radon as well as emerging pollutants;
Identification of differences and modes of interaction between indoor and outdoor air quality at relevant and representative locations;
Development and deployment of technologies enabling cost-effective monitoring of indoor air quality (e.g. air quality sensors) and user-friendly alert systems;
Development and deployment of effect-based test systems for the detection of synergistic effects of different biogenic particles and substances as well as additional chemical substances such as volatile organic compounds, including in vitro and in vivo approaches with respect to 3Rs[2];
Identification of body burdens resulting from multipollutant (real-life scenario) indoor exposures and associated health effects, with specific focus on vulnerable population groups and sensitive life stages;
Conducting dose-response studies to facilitate the setting of purposeful quality standards;
Development of cost-effective, environment-friendly and scalable technologies to improve indoor air quality to reduce disease burdens;
Preparation of guidelines and training materials for interventions, supporting health promotion and disease prevention in various sectors, e.g. construction and transport, and in various socio-economic settings;
Delivery of FAIR[3] data and databases structured to allow user-friendly access to information about exposures, sources and risk factors.
Aspects such as gender, regional variations, socio-economics and culture should be considered, where appropriate.
Proposals should ensure that chemical monitoring data are shared in IPCHEM[4] through involvement with the European Commission's Joint Research Centre (JRC).
All projects funded under this topic are strongly encouraged to participate in networking and joint activities, as appropriate. These networking and joint activities could, for example, involve the participation in joint workshops, the exchange of knowledge, the development and adoption of best practices, or joint communication activities.

To that end, proposals under this topic should aim for delivering results that are directed, tailored towards and contributing to all of the following expected outcomes:
Global and EU climate policies[1], the EU Observatory for Climate and Health[2], and the Green Deal activities are supported with up-to-date scientific evidence;
Public authorities and surveillance organisations have access to predictive and early warning systems for direct and indirect health impacts caused by climate-change induced events and dispose of indicators for improved monitoring of policy actions;
Public authorities, employers and risk managers draw benefit from user-friendly tools for integrated risk assessments and cost-benefit analysis of climate change mitigation and adaptation actions to support decisions across policy sectors;
Public and private health authorities and care providers use guidelines and training materials produced to adapt and innovate health systems and practices to prevent and mitigate climate change related health risks in cost-efficient and effective ways.
Scope:
The European Green Deal refocused the European Commission’s commitment of tackling climate and environment-related challenges. It also aims to protect, conserve and enhance the EU's natural capital, and protect the health and well-being of citizens from environment-related risks and impacts. In addition to aiming for climate neutrality by 2050, the Commission adopted a more ambitious EU strategy on adaptation to climate change on 24 February 2021. This is essential, as climate change will continue to create significant stress in Europe in spite of the mitigation efforts.
The World Health Organization estimates that climate change will cause at least 250 000 additional deaths per year globally between 2030 and 2050[3]. Climate change, together with other natural and man-made health stressors, can influence human health and disease patterns in numerous ways. Some existing health threats will intensify and new health threats will emerge, with variable impact on different socio-economic groups. Climate changes induce events such as changes in biodiversity, disruption of ecosystems, habitats and land use, global warming and heat waves, changes in UV exposure or flooding. These events are influencing globally the incidence and spread of infectious diseases and increasing pollution, thereby causing new threats to human health.
The aim of this topic is the identification, monitoring and quantification of direct and indirect impacts on human health, including in occupational settings, and related risk factors correlated to climate change, especially in vulnerable population groups such as children or in groups at risk such as workers. Innovative surveillance tools are further required to ensure a timely response to emerging threats, to feed and strengthen early warning systems, and to enable the design, monitoring and evaluation of interventions. This may include mathematical modelling with big data and artificial intelligence (AI), remote sensing, citizen science and biomarkers of exposure or virulence.
Proposals must choose and address one of the following areas of research:
Research on the relationships between changes in environmental hazards caused by climate change, the impacts on interrelated ecosystems and their influence on human health;
Climate induced emergence and transmission of pathogens and spread of zoonotic pathogens using Eco-health[4] and One Health[5] approaches.
Proposals should include all of the following activities:
Development of suitable indicators and monitoring mechanisms to assess the health-relevant outcomes of climate policies and actions;
Development of predictive models and early warning systems for exposure and health impacts of climate change based on transparent assumptions and architecture;
Development of tools for health impact and cost-benefit assessment of climate-change adaptation and mitigation measures;
Investigation of health co-benefits of adaptation and mitigation policy measures outside the health sector;
Demonstration of the validity of tools and methods developed in the above listed activities in policy-relevant case studies;
Determination of the societal implications of climate change on health systems, including occupational health, and development of adaptation measures;
Development of training materials and guidelines to educate relevant actors in citizens’ daily life on climate change health impacts and to facilitate adaptation of health systems and practices;
Delivery of FAIR[6] data on positive and negative health impacts of climate change, including impact on groups at higher risk or vulnerability.
International cooperation is encouraged with the specific aim to support international climate policies. If projects use satellite-based earth observation, positioning, navigation and/or related timing data and services, they must make use of Copernicus and/or Galileo/EGNOS (other data and services may additionally be used).[7].

Specific Challenge: This topic aims to facilitate multilingual online communication for the benefit of the digital single market which is still fragmented by language barriers that hamper a wide penetration of cross-border commerce, social communication and exchange of cultural content. Current machine translation solutions typically perform well only for a limited number of target languages, and for a given text type.
The aim of this challenge is to launch interdisciplinary work leading to a new paradigm in overcoming the language barrier and progressively, to reach high quality for all language combinations and translation directions, and cater for the most demanded text types and use contexts. Systems and solutions that are intended to overcome the language barriers, are expected to deal with huge volumes, high variety of languages and text styles, and deliver results in reasonable time (in most cases, instantly). Where the methods require automatic learning from language resources, the availability and suitability of the latter need to be addressed.  Special focus is on the 21 EU languages (both as source and target languages) that have ""fragmentary"" or ""weak/no"" machine translation support according to the META-net language white papers.
Scope:
a.      Research & Innovation Actions to kick off a multidisciplinary research path to develop a new paradigm leading to radically improved quality and coverage (in terms of languages and text types) of machine translation. Special focus is on issues where current methods fall short in quality or fail to adapt to different languages and different needs of translation, or where further improvement with current methods becomes very expensive or requires such amounts of training data that are not available. The projects should use existing and emerging structures (in particular, those developed under action c) below) for testing, validating and evaluating the novel methods against agreed benchmarks.
b.      Innovative Actions in view of optimizing translation quality and language/topical coverage in demanding, realistic use situations arising from well documented market needs, for example in pan-European online services. The pilots should focus on areas where multilingualism contributes to competitiveness and user-friendliness and optimize, evaluate and test performance improvements with languages that are poorly served by current machine translation systems. The pilots should make use of and contribute to existing and emerging platforms and infrastructures for pooling, building, and adding value to language resources and tools.
c.       Coordination actions to promote benchmarking and competitive evaluation of machine translation, as well as the optimal use of language resources from various sources, in view of federating the sources and repositories towards a single access mechanism, respecting appropriate standards of interoperability and metadata.
Expected impact:
         Initiating a programme of ground-breaking actions that will deliver, by 2025, an online EU internal market free of language barriers, delivering automated translation quality, equal to currently best performing language pair/direction, in most relevant use situations and for at least 90% of the EU official languages.
         Significantly improving the quality, coverage and technical maturity of automatic translation for at least half of the 21 EU languages that currently have ""weak or no support"" or ""fragmentary support"" of machine translation solutions, according to the META-NET Language White Papers referenced before.
         Attracting a community of hundreds of contributors of language resources and language technology tools (from all EU Member States and Associated Countries) to adopt and support a single platform for sharing, maintaining and making use of language resources and tools;  establishing widely agreed benchmarks for machine translation quality and stimulating competition between methods and systems.

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
In view of privacy considerations, businesses are often unsure about how to deal with the data collected through their operations. This data is of particularly high value to companies for offering personalised services or developing new business models. Data subjects (citizens, consumers) often feel that they have no control over the use of their personal data. This is aggravated by uncontrolled exploitation, aggregation and linking of personal data by large corporations and advertisers. The resulting lack of confidence undermines efficient and legitimate data sharing and value creation for agreed purposes. The challenge is to develop technologies that are inherently privacy-preserving and offer the basis for empowering the data subjects to understand and be informed of (and, where appropriate, control) the use of their personal data, and the entrepreneurs to develop and run their data driven business.
Scope:
Research and Innovation actions will advance the state of the art in the definition of methods that will support protection of personal data for harvesting, sharing and querying data assets. The personal data protection methods shall be implemented in secure and robust software modules and be exposed to publicly administered penetration/hacking challenges, open to participants the world over. Cross-disciplinary consortia are required to conduct legally and methodologically sound field work and coordinate with the CSA to determine i) if the various formal notions of personal data protection implemented are consistent with EU legislation and with the ethical intuitions of the EU citizens such methods are designed to protect; ii) to what extent privacy protection measures can be personalised in a way that remains intelligible to the data subject while remaining consistent with EU legislation. The diversity (e.g. in terms of age, sex, gender, socio-economic class) of data subjects should be taken into account, as appropriate. The data experimentation and integration projects (ICT-14) are likely to provide real-world challenges and data to validate the privacy-preserving technologies. The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 2 and 4 million would allow this area to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Coordination and Support Actions will complement the research by exploring the societal and ethical implications and provide a broad basis and wider context to validate privacy-preserving technologies. The CSA is expected to liaise with a broad and multidisciplinary community of stakeholders (including public administrations, research community, companies, civil society, citizens) to advise the research and innovation in privacy-preserving (Big) Data technologies, promoting an integrated societally and ethically valid approach. Another task is to observe, map and report on ethical and Responsible Research and Innovation (RRI) issues in the field of Big Data, including technology, research, markets and education. The action is expected to organise networking, awareness-raising and consultation among its communities, connect with the technical RIAs to inform their thinking and issue reports, analyses and recommendations. The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of about EUR 1 million would allow this area to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts. No more than one action will be funded.
Expected Impact:
a. Research and Innovation actions
Substantial improvement of technologies for data access, processing and analysis to better protect consumer and personal data and respect security in line with existing and future EU rules on the protection of personal data, and as measured in terms of improved confidence and satisfaction of data subjects by the end of 2020;
Substantial improvements towards creating a secure environment for data access, process and analysis, demonstrated in the use situations that arise in the data experimentation/integration projects (ICT-14).
b. Coordination and Support action
Appropriate consideration and attention towards an ethically sound approach to big data processing, and effective involvement of the relevant actors and stakeholders;

The challenge is to scale up innovative businesses across the EU, detect high potential innovations and support innovators in going to market. Actions under this heading reinforce the Startup Europe and Innovation Radar initiatives and link to the activities of the European Innovation Council in a complementary way by targeting exclusively ICT innovators that are not supported by the EIC.
Scope:
Actions should help startups and scaleups achieve market success and mature the innovation excellence of high potential innovators. Actions should support the creation of new jobs and high growth businesses and support their growth on a pan-European and international level. Innovators identified, promoted and supported by the Innovation Radar are expected to enrich and benefit from the Startup Europe ecosystem[1][2][3]. Projects should demonstrate sustainability of proposed actions beyond the life of the project. Where appropriate, the projects should seek synergies with ESIF funds or ESIF supported actions in order to improve the synergies between H2020 and ESIF.
a. Innovation actions
Connecting local deep-tech startup ecosystems and supporting cross-border activities: among the 4-5 startups ecosystems connected by each project, at least half of them will be located in less developed ecosystems. Actively connect them to the Startup Europe one-stop-shop and involve the Digital Innovation Hubs to support individual ecosystems. Cross-border activities will include: connecting deep-tech entrepreneurs with e.g. potential investors, business partners, accessing skills and services helping startups soft land in new markets. Particular focus will be placed on stimulating partnerships between scaleups and corporates with a view to procurement. Special attention will be placed to support digital startups and scaleups wherever situated in Europe, to access public procurement opportunities across borders.
b. Coordination and support actions
Provide targeted and tailored go-to-market support to SMEs, startups, scaleups, spinoffs and market-oriented researchers, who are supported by EU funded ICT projects[4] and are delivering market-creating innovations that have scale-up potential.
Insight and intelligence from the Innovation Radar is to be used to detect EU-funded innovators who face the biggest market opportunities (enhancement of Innovation Radar data by merging with relevant third party data sources is welcomed).
Support for innovators is expected to include mentoring, coaching, investor readiness training, coaching on how to bid for public procurement sales opportunities, connecting innovators with potential customers, business partners and investors (Business Angels, Venture Capital, Crowdfunding and other relevant forms of financing).
Expected Impact:
Proposals should address the following and provide appropriate metrics for measuring success with respect to a defined baseline:
a. Innovation actions
Increased connectedness among members of deep-tech startup ecosystems and their companies (startups and scaleups) and to the larger European business ecosystem seeking maximum synergies
Increased access to customers, private and public, better access to qualified employees, access to the right combination of finance and prospects for scaling up across border;
Stimulate European investments in deep-tech digital sectors through increasing the number of cross-border investments; demonstrate sustainability of proposed actions beyond the life of the project.
b. Coordination and Support actions

Deadline date","Scope:
Specific Challenge: Technologies, networks and new digital and social media are changing the way people behave, think, interact and socialize as persons, citizens, workers and consumers. Understanding the nature and consequences of these changes in order to better shape the digital future is a key success factor for the values and competitiveness of the European society. There is a need for exploring the two-way interactions between technology and society in order to lay foundations for future thinking in ICT and for future regulatory and policy-making activities in the DAE areas.
Scope:
a.      The Research & Innovation Actions should aim at in-depth exploration of the development of fundamental notions such as identity, privacy, relationships, culture, reputation, motivations, responsibility, attention, safety and fairness, in the hyper-connected age where the limits between offline and online are blurred in numerous ways. Gender, generational and cultural differences in behaviours should also be considered where relevant.
Examples of relevant research topics include:
         How do humans cope with information overload and attention scarcity? How do ICT environments and processes affect the ways individuals deal with information flows and focus their attention?
         How does the blurring between online and offline world affect the way people experience their different settings (work, leisure, family)? How can smart and connected environments support individuals and society?
         What are the norms and behaviours that should be considered for behaving ethically and being fair to each other in a hyper-connected digital world? How should their adoption in the digital culture be fostered?
b.      The coordination and support activities should facilitate community building between ICT developers, researchers in SSH and other disciplines, and stakeholders for responsible research and innovation. They should provide concrete incentives and motivations for cross-disciplinary collaborations. Coordination actions are invited to coordinate  and support responsible research and innovation through ICT and within ICT R&D&I areas on different parts of the H2020 Work programme, notably by efficient exchange of results between SSH research, on-going R&D&I projects and relevant areas of policy making and regulatory activities.
Expected impact:
a.      The Research & Innovation Actions supported under this objective are expected to:
         provide new knowledge of the ways by which individuals and communities work, think, learn, behave, and interact in the new hyper-connected environments and of how these new developments affect people's perceptions of self, services, entrepreneurship, democracy, and governance.
         provide well-founded transferable results, including innovative concepts and proved functional models, which can be exploited in the future research, policy and regulatory agendas.
b.      The coordination and support activities are expected to
         provide support to the ongoing and future ICT projects by establishing an efficient and effective collaboration ground between ICT developers, researchers in multiple disciplines, and a broad stakeholder base (including society, industry, policy makers).
         provide support for take-up and establish best practices for responsible research and innovation in different areas of ICT Work programme.
All successful projects should establish broad and durable constituencies, which support results take up and further work beyond the lifetime of the project.

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
The ever-increasing role of technology in our daily life offers huge potential for added value for our society. Artists can help unleash this potential. They can help shape a better relation of technology and humans and stimulate human-centred innovation through their transversal competencies and unconventional thinking. The challenge of the S+T+ARTS=STARTS program – innovation at the nexus of Science, Technology and the Arts - is to better address innovation in industry and society by engaging artists in European R&I projects to explore unconventional art-inspired solutions to industrial/societal problems.
Scope:
The topic will support art-driven innovation in European R&I projects by inclusion of artists in research consortia.
a) STARTS lighthouse pilots (RIA instrument) will explore art-inspired solutions to industrial/societal challenges in two chosen areas. Pilots will engage industry, technology, end-users, and artists in a broad artistic exploration of technologies with the aim of creating novel products, processes and services that respond better to human needs. The added value of artistic practices to realise unexpected solutions via artistic exploration must be clearly put forward in the two light house pilots.
(i) Lighthouse pilot in 'art-inspired interactive human-centred environments' created by digital objects and novel media, like IoT, augmented reality or social media. The pilot will explore how these digital objects and media can lead – via artistic exploration – to novel experiences and new models for creativity and thereby to unexpected solutions for challenges in the city, in the home or for mobility.
(ii) Lighthouse pilot in 'art-inspired urban manufacturing' driven by de-centralised digitally-enabled production systems and co-creation in urban environments. The pilot will explore how digitally-enabled small-scale production/manufacturing systems and networks combined with artistic exploration and creativity in design and process - can revive the social, ecological and economic urban space and lead to unexpected products and services in an urban environment.
It is expected to fund one lighthouse pilot in each of the two chosen areas (i) and (ii). For grants awarded under this topic for Research and Innovation Actions at least 30% of the EU funding requested shall be allocated to contributions to the work by artists and creatives.
For grants awarded under this topic for Research and Innovation Actions beneficiaries may provide support to third parties as described in part K of the General Annexes of the Work Programme. The support to third parties can only be provided in the form of grants. The respective options of Article 15.1 and Article 15.3 of the Model Grant Agreement will be applied. Third party support is expected to help cover the work of artists and creatives.
b) Coordination and Support Action (CSA instrument) to create a STARTS ecosystem by coordinating artistic and innovation relevant aspects of the two lighthouse pilots and of other European/international R&I projects that put artists and creatives at the centre of innovation. Tasks comprise analysing and helping implement best practices for including artists in R&I, organising events, providing online spaces for artists and technologists to meet, presenting the results from art-technology collaborations in exhibitions that are highly visible in the art world and in industry, and assisting European research teams to learn from art and design thinking as a strategy for innovation.. It is expected to fund one Coordination and Support Action.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of up to EUR 4 million for each of the two light house pilots for Research and Innovation Actions and of up to EUR 1 million for maximum one Coordination and Support Action would allow the areas to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts. All proposals under a) and b) should target a duration of 3 years.
Expected Impact:
The demonstration of value-added to industry and society in having artists contribute to the development of radically new products, services and processes.
Signalling effect for future uptake of art-driven solutions to concrete industrial and societal challenges and art-driven user-centred products and services.
Efficient working models how art-technology collaboration can contribute to innovative processes in research, industry and society.
Burgeoning STARTS ecosystem involving industry, technology, research, end-users, societal stakeholders, and the Art world that reconciles and unites the goals and thinking of industry and technology with that of the Art world.

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
The development and deployment of digital technologies and services induces pervasive and radical changes in our lives and in the societal system. The explosion of the number of devices, their increased ""intelligence"", autonomous behavior and connectivity are changing significantly the life conditions of Europeans. Beyond the benefits brought about by technological innovations, there are also challenges, and sometimes threats, that need to be addressed to ensure that technological innovations go hand in hand with societal needs and expectations. Including SSH (social sciences and humanities) expertise provides a constructive and critical accompaniment of the scientific and technological developments for the projects funded under LEIT-ICT, and enables responsible research and innovation in the digital age.
SSH engagement in ICT research can both address proactively the impacts of the take-up of novel technologies, and contribute to innovation by proposing alternative approaches. For example, considering that there is a trade-off between privacy and security refers to conceptions that can be challenged. Reconsidering underlying assumptions or taking a new and broader view to ICT related research and innovation can lead to other options that inspire different and more responsible technological R&I, with new benefits for the society.
Scope:
a. Research and Innovation Actions should take a fresh look on the relationship between information and communication technologies, on the one hand, and social phenomena, on the other hand. They should contribute to ongoing ICT-driven research and innovation by providing best practice in collaborative research between SSH and ICT communities. The projects are expected to have direct relevance to ongoing ICT-related research and innovation, in particular in the area of robotics, cyber-physical systems, internet of things, big data and cybersecurity.
From this wide range of issues, proposals are expected to focus on one or both of the following clusters:
How can we avoid the traps of ICTs ending up in isolating humans behind their screen, or harnessing them in a passive role? In the forthcoming hyperconnected era, it is essential to acknowledge the dual human aspirations for relationships and for freedom, and the dynamic nature of the relationships between humans and artefacts.
What are the conditions for ICT-enabled innovations to generate interesting and rewarding jobs, and reduce the risk of excluding sections of society from the labour market? What economic models can ensure a fair sharing of the created added value?
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 1 and 2 million would allow this area to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
b. Smaller short-term Research and Innovation Actions are expected to engage SSH expertise and, potentially other actors, to reflect and challenge the way ICT-related research and innovation is currently approached in a specific area and/or reflected in the call text. This approach opens new ways for interactions between SSH and ICT. SSH expertise is called for to unveil and challenge the implicit assumptions underlying broader technological research agendas, with a view to propose constructive alternative framings which enhance considerations for responsible ICT research and innovation. These so called ""sister projects"" should clearly describe how they intend to bring an innovative research perspective for one or more LEIT ICT topic areas. These projects are expected to have a light project structure, accommodating for its exploratory experimental nature and its relevance beyond disciplinary boundaries.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 300.000 and 500.000 and running for 12 months would allow this area to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts and/or proposing other durations.
Minimum one action will be selected for each of the areas (a, b) described above.
Note that there are related topics with emphasis on SSH and responsible ICT research and innovation in other parts of ICT LEIT WP.
Expected Impact:
Alternative approaches and new perspectives for future societal relevant ICT research and innovation activities.
Increased research collaboration and common agenda between ICT and RRI-SSH communities.
Improved take-up of responsible ICT research and innovation that takes into account human and societal concerns and expectations under new technological conditions
Increased relevance and usability of SSH knowledge for ICT R&I processes in order to align ICT R&I with human needs and societal expectations.
Increased societal relevance of future research agendas in ICT-related areas.

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Innovation, today, is as much about novel solutions that technology and design can provide as it is about understanding needs of society and ensuring wide participation in the process of innovation. In this context, the Arts are gaining prominence as a catalyst of an efficient conversion of S&T knowledge into innovative products, services, and processes.
The challenge is to accelerate and widen the exchange of skills of artists and creative people with entrepreneurs and technologists, thus creating a common language and understanding. This topic supports the STARTS (S&T&ARTS) initiative, fostering innovation at the nexus of 'Science, Technology and the Arts'.
Scope:
The activities are structured in two lines: establishing a structured dialogue between creative people and technology developers and encouraging artists' integration into research and innovation projects, providing visibility of good practices and rewarding them.
a. Innovation Action establishing a structured dialogue between creative people and technologists:
First, it will identify the relevant regional, national and international agencies active in education, research and economic support of the Creative Industries and:
establish a Europe wide sustainable structured dialogue, ensuring the synchronisation of the efforts; as well as
promote the replication of successful initiatives across other industries and European countries.
Second, it will directly support creative people and technologists to work together and produce unconventional and compelling new products. Taking advantage of existing structures such as fab labs, creative and innovation hubs, the action should at least combine the following activities:
Launch a yearly Europe wide competition for the best creative product ideas and ensure the financial support of their realisation. The action should cover the promotion of the competition, the selection process and support for the development of the selected ideas into fully functional prototypes. The competitors should be teams of creative individuals and technologists providing novel ideas to be evaluated according to their originality, feasibility and economic or social value potential.
Promote the newly selected ideas as well as the prototypes resulting from the selection of the previous year, through highly visible actions addressing both the general public and potential investors across Europe[1].
Develop a sustainability strategy to ensure the persistence of the experiences gained and the coordination mechanisms set up during the action beyond the funding period.
The action may involve financial support to third parties in line with the conditions set out in Part K of the General Annexes. The consortium will define the process for selecting the prototype developments to which financial support will be granted (typically below the range of EUR 50.000 per experiment). At least 80% of the funding should be dedicated to the prototype developments.
.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of about EUR 3 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
b. Coordination and Support Actions
Proposals will cover one of the two areas defined below:
1. Integration of artists in research and innovation projects is encouraged across all ICT objectives in WP2016/2017. To facilitate this integration and help build silo-breaking partnerships between industries, entrepreneurs, and researchers in ICT with the Arts, a Coordination and Support Action will provide a brokerage service that will:
Fund short-term residencies/fellowships in running H2020 projects or in institutions and sponsor ‘matchmaking events’ (workshops, hackatons, etc.) that will allow artists and ICT experts to develop common work practices and address concrete problems.
Set up an online platform to match partners from the ICT and the Arts, identify concrete R&D&I problems that artistic practices could help address.
Organise an annual high visible STARTS event with international outreach bringing together H2020 projects, industrial players and artists and showcasing successful interactions between industry, technology and the Arts.
2. Implementation of a 'STARTS prize' that will showcase vision and innovation in technology rooted in links with the Arts by giving visibility to the most forward- looking collaborations and the impact on innovation that they have achieved. rewarding outstanding contributions to innovation resulting from collaborations of technology with the Arts. The support action will ensure publicising the prize, handling of submission in a scalable manner, the evaluation procedure for the prize in liaison with the EC services, the award ceremony together with an exhibition and a (travelling) exhibition of shortlisted works.
It is foreseen to hand out two annual prizes (20.000Euros each) covering different aspects of STARTS, one honouring artistic exploration where appropriation by the Arts has altered (the use, deployment, or perception of) technology and one that honours works linking ICT and the Arts (technological or artistic) that open new pathways for innovation and/or society.
To achieve visibility and impact the STARTS prize must be a long-term commitment, must reach out to both technology/industry and to the art world. It might therefore be best linked to an existing high profile prize allowing leveraging existing resources and credentials. This action allows for the provision of financial support to third parties in the form of prize in line with the conditions set out in Part K of the General Annexes.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of about EUR 4 million for area 1 and of about EU 1 million for area 2 would allow each area to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts. Proposals should target a duration of four years.
Expected Impact:
Provide the European landscape with sustainable structured dialogues between creative people and technologists.
Increase the transfer of knowledge between the ICT and the Creative Industries.
Contribute to a change of culture, appreciating the societal and economic added value of creativity, promoting more innovation-oriented mind-set rooted in silo-breaking collaborations between technology and the Arts.

The challenge is the development of advanced photonics technologies which have the potential to revolutionise an existing application sector or to create completely new applications and markets.
Scope:
The focus is on the following themes (sub-topics):
3D light field and holographic displays: Actions should develop innovative photonics components and systems which enable 3D light field or holographic displays for use in mixed-reality applications such as automotive, healthcare, telecommunication, entertainment and gaming. In addition, the display components actions may also develop sensors and actuators for necessary support functionality such as sensing, connectivity, user interaction, and scene recognition etc. Actions must include validation in application settings.
Packaging and module integration for photonic integrated circuits (PIC): Development of novel packaging, assembly, module integration technologies or novel testing approaches offering breakthrough advances for the automated, flexible, low-cost, high volume, scalable production of PIC-based photonic components or modules. Actions should demonstrate the technical and industrial feasibility of the proposed technologies or approaches through a functional demonstrator.
Light to Fuel: Development of photonics devices at TRL level 5-6 for the direct and efficient (>5%) conversion of solar energy into chemical fuel. Actions may also include R&D into catalyst development and disruptive material and device concepts where appropriate. Actions should demonstrate technical and economic feasibility.
Next generation biophotonics methods and devices as research tools to understand the cellular origin of diseases: Actions will focus on photonics-based in-vivo/in-vitro imaging systems and techniques which deliver greatly increased penetration, resolution, sensitivity, specificity and depth of focus. Real time data handling and processing may also be addressed as appropriate. Actions should include medical/clinical doctors or research laboratories with relevant experience.
At least one proposal will be selected to cover each of these themes.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU between EUR 3 and 6 million would allow these to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
Proposals should describe how the proposed work would contribute to the listed corresponding expected impacts and metrics, including the baseline and the targets to measure impact.
Actions should enable European system manufacturers to bring to market highly competitive products by integrating 3D light field and holographic visualization solutions for systems and user-centric services in different areas, and to build a Europe-centred value chain from the domestic manufacturing of components and software up to the system integrators and end users.
Approaches must deliver a reduction in production costs by an order of magnitude, enabling the introduction of PIC technology in new markets.
The projects should demonstrate the efficient conversion of solar energy into chemical fuels, with a device efficiency of >5% and payback period of <10 years. This should enable Europe taking the lead in creating a multi-billion industry, and give independence from imported energy.

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Interactive Technologies such as Augmented (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR) are set to transform the ways in which people communicate, interact and share information on the Internet and beyond. This will directly impact a larger number of European industries ranging from manufacturing, data life cycle, healthcare, engineering, to education, entertainment, media and culture, enabling new business opportunities. The challenge is to forge a competitive and sustainable ecosystem of European technology providers in Interactive Technologies.
Scope:
The full scope of the EU intervention in this areas includes: 1/ support a pan-European coordination effort to strengthen the collaboration among the constituency (ICT-25-2018); 2/ improve competiveness through research into future high-quality multi-sensorial interactive hardware and multi-user interaction systems (ICT-25-2018) and 3/ increase the European innovation capacity through the development of new authoring tools and the access to a broader community which will be the objective of this specific call through Innovation Actions.
The uptake of Interactive Technologies in various industrial and societal domains
To maintain competitiveness and allow the European industry to embrace these new technologies, the objective of the proposal should be either to:
develop authoring tools for automated interactive content creation that can be used also by non-expert users on various platforms and environments; The authoring tools are expected to:
rely on less manual input enabling quicker content creation
manage large quantities of data
allow higher fidelity
allow improved immersion, engaging all senses
or develop solutions in key sectors such as in manufacturing, automotive, healthcare or cultural and creative industries or in sectors where the use of such technology is not mainstream.
Focus should be on developing richer virtual environments, new user interfaces and improved immersion maximizing the feeling of presence.
Proposals should ensure that the targeted industries have a leading role in the design of solutions and guarantee the take up of the technology. Actions are expected to engage and contribute to the exchange platforms developed in the frame of the CSA on Interactive Technologies funded under H2020 ICT-25-2018 eXtended Reality for All (XR4All – GA 825545).
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 1.5 and 2 million with a duration from 12 to 24 months would allow this area to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
Increase in the use of Interactive Technologies in the industrial and societal domains.
Increase in the number of European SMEs and start-ups who benefit from technology transfer.
Increase in market opportunities in the Interactive Technologies sector for European SMEs.

Internet of Things (IoT) technologies and applications are bringing fundamental changes to all sectors of society and economy and constitute an essential element of the Next Generation Internet (NGI). The challenge is to leverage EU technological strength to develop the next generation of IoT devices and systems which leverage progress in enabling technologies such as 5G, cyber-security, distributed computing, artificial intelligence (AI), Augmented Reality and tactile internet. In addition it is important to build and sustain a competitive ecosystem of European technology and system providers in IoT as well as ensuring end-user trust, adequate security and privacy by design.
Scope:
The scope is to develop and demonstrate novel IoT concepts and solutions to underpin the NGI vision and make provision for predicting future events, trigger actions and moving decisions to the point of interest in order to better serve the end-user
a) Research and Innovation Actions (RIA)
Proposals must provide reference implementations in terms of a dynamically configured infrastructure and integration schemes for smart devices into self-adaptive, robust, safe, intuitive, secure and interconnected smart network and service platforms. Reference implementations should include proof-of-concept, demonstrations and validation, driven by realistic use cases with advanced needs in areas such as wearables, transportation, agriculture homes, health, energy, and manufacturing.
Proposals should clearly explain how access to the necessary infrastructure for leveraging key technologies such as 5G, edge computing and distributed AI will be ensured. The action may involve cascading calls through financial support to third parties in line with the conditions set out in Part K of the General Annexes, duly justified as a means to achieving the overall objectives. The consortium will define the selection process of additional users and suppliers for which financial support will be granted (typically in the order of EUR 50.000 to 150.000[1] per party but smaller amounts may also be justified). Maximum 30% of the requested EU contribution requested by the proposal should be allocated to this purpose.
Proposals must address all the following challenges (sub-topics):
Next generation IoT architectures with a focus on user-aware, self-aware and semi-autonomous IoT systems. This should also address new real-time capable solutions, which solve performance challenges such as streaming and filtering at the edge, latency and network constraints. A further challenge is to make use of distributed AI, address security, privacy and trust requirements by design and allow for new de-centralised topologies and governance.
Interoperability to cope with the increased complexity of connecting vast numbers of heterogeneous devices with increasing demands for data sharing, protection of privacy, data monetization and contractual arrangements (e.g. blockchains/DLTs) for secure and trusted interaction.
Intelligent IoT devices supporting the proposed use cases and drawing from applicable results in micro-nano-bio technologies, including resource-aware hardware/software concepts, low power processor platforms integrating computing, networking, storage and acceleration elements, new communication schemes and topologies that range from the cloud continuum towards mesh, and securing computing and communication at device level with constrained resources.
Tactile/contextual Internet of Things based on human-centric sensing/actuating, augmented/virtual reality and new IoT service capabilities such as integration with parallel and opportunistic computing capabilities, neuromorphic and contextual computing.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 5 and 8 million would allow this area to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
b) Coordination and Support Action (CSA)
A support action will support measures for further development of IoT ecosystems, partnerships, stakeholders networking, contribution to pre-normative activities and to standardisation, development of business models, innovation activities and skills building.
It will liaise also with NGI and other initiatives of the work programme that are relevant to IoT related research and innovation activities.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of EUR 2 million would allow this area to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
Contribution to human-centred IoT evolution improving usability and user acceptance, notably through strengthened security and user control.
Contribution to emerging or future standards and pre-normative activities
Long-term evolution of next-generation IoT infrastructures and service platforms technologies and contribution to scientific progress enabling novel, future semi-autonomous IoT applications.

New leading-edge research infrastructures in all fields of science and technology are needed by the European scientific community in order to remain at the forefront of the advancement of research, and to be able to help industry strengthen its base of knowledge and its technological know-how. The aim of this activity is to support the conceptual and technical design for new research infrastructures which are of a clear European dimension and interest. Major upgrades of existing infrastructures may also be considered if the end result is intended to be equivalent to a new infrastructure.
Scope:
Design studies should address all key questions concerning the technical and conceptual feasibility of new or upgraded fully fledged user facilities (proposals considering just a component for research infrastructures are not targeted by this topic). Design studies lead to a 'conceptual design report' showing the maturity of the concept and forming the basis for identifying and constructing the next generation of Europe's and the world's leading research infrastructures. Conceptual design reports will present major choices for design alternatives and associated cost ranges, both in terms of their strategic relevance for meeting today's and tomorrow's societal challenges, and (where applicable) in terms of the technical work underpinning the development of new or upgraded research infrastructures of European interest. All fields of science are considered.
The activities to be performed in a Design Study proposal include both:
Scientific and technical work, i.e. (1) the drafting of concepts, architecture and engineering plans for the construction, taking into due account resource efficiency and environmental (including climate-related) impacts, as well as, when relevant, the creation of prototypes; (2) scientific and technical work to ensure that the scientific user communities exploit the new facility from the start with the highest efficiency.
Conceptual work, i.e. (1) plans to coherently integrate the new infrastructure into the European landscape of related facilities in accordance, whenever appropriate, with the EU objective of a balanced territorial development; (2) the estimated budget for construction and operation; (3) plans for an international governance structure; (4) the planning of research services to be provided at international level, (5) procedure and criteria to choose the site of the infrastructure.
The main output of a design study will be the conceptual design reports for a new or upgraded research infrastructure of strategic importance for Europe.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 1 and 3 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.

The ESFRI roadmap, updated periodically, identifies the needs of the European scientific community in terms of research infrastructures. However, inclusion in the ESFRI roadmap does not guarantee that these needed infrastructures will be built. Before proceeding with the construction and/or implementation of the identified infrastructures, many preliminary decisions need to be taken with respect to issues such as the identification of funders, the financial plan for sustainability, the governance by involved stakeholders, the site and legal form of the managing organisation (and of the research infrastructure, if different), the architecture and the service policies. The aim of this activity is to provide catalytic and leveraging support for the preparatory phase and the early phase of ESFRI projects leading to the construction of new research infrastructures or major upgrades of existing ones.

The preparatory phase aims to bring the project for the new or upgraded research infrastructure identified in the ESFRI roadmap to the level of legal, financial, and, where applicable, technical maturity required for implementing it.
Proposal consortia should involve all the stakeholders necessary to move the project forward, to take the decisions, and to make the financial commitments, before construction can start (e.g. national/regional ministries/governments, research councils, funding agencies, in particular, but not limited to, from the countries that have already declared their commitment in the application to ESFRI). Appropriate contacts with ministries and decision-makers should be continuously reinforced, thus further strengthening the consortia. Operators of research facilities, research centres, universities, and industry may also be involved whenever appropriate. Technical work should be carried out when necessary to complete the final technical design, providing a sound technical base for establishing a cost baseline and detailed financial planning. The financial needs of the project should be mapped out to the extent necessary for funding agencies to establish their own medium- and long-term financial planning.
The preparation of the legal and financial agreements (including site, governance, internal rules, financing of the new research infrastructures) is one of the main activities and deliverables and should be finalised before the end of the project (e.g., through the signature of a Memorandum of Understanding).
The detailed list of activities that can be included in a preparatory phase proposal is given in part A of the section “Specific features for Research Infrastructures”. Proposals should explain any synergies and complementarities with previous or current EU grants.

","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
This topic covers two interrelated and synergic areas:
(a) Supporting Centres of Excellence (CoE) that promote the use of upcoming exascale and extreme performance computing capabilities in areas where user communities in collaboration with other HPC stakeholders can develop or scale up existing parallel codes towards exascale and extreme scaling performance, resulting into tangible benefits for addressing scientific, industrial or societal challenges.
(b) Addressing the fragmentation of activities for excellence in HPC applications, and fostering the widening of the use of HPC codes in the EU, by establishing a focal point for the consulting skills and training available from the CoE, and from other HPC centres or organisations, including PRACE.
Scope:
(a) Research and Innovation Actions
CoEs will be user-driven and inherently committed to co-design activities so as to ensure that future HPC architectures are well-suited for the applications and their users, providing them with a high performance and scalable application base. CoEs will federate capabilities around Europe, exploiting available competences, and ensuring multidisciplinarity (combining application domain and HPC system, software and algorithm expertise) and synergies with national/local programmes.
Proposals for CoEs should clearly identify one of the following areas as the main focus of their work and the challenges addressed:
Engineering: aeronautics, automotive and/or new combustion engines;
Environmental sciences: climate and weather simulation, natural hazards forecast and prevention;
Biomolecular research: combined research in chemical, biological, physical and computational science;
Health/medicine:, computational methods and simulation in the biomedical domain;
Materials science and engineering: materials design, simulation and modelling;
Energy: optimising energy consumption and supporting the transition to a reliable and low carbon and clean energy supply;
Big Data and Global Challenges: Big Data analytics for strategic global issues;
Performance optimisation: optimisation and productivity services for HPC academic and industrial code(s) (including support to selected Centres of Excellence)
Other domains (with a focus not addressed by any of the areas above)
Proposals should address all the following points:
Research in HPC applications towards highly scalable, optimised codes and the path to exascale performance (both computing and extreme data);
The provision of services supporting different usage models for the community needs, and contributing to the potential convergence of HPC, High Throughput Computing (HTC), and HPDA (High-Performance Data Analytics). This includes developing, maintaining, optimising (if needed re-design) and scaling HPC application codes, addressing the full scientific/industrial workflow, particularly covering data aspects; testing and validating codes and quality assurance;
Commitment to the co-design approach (hardware, software, codes), including the identification of suitable applications relevant to the development of HPC technologies towards exascale;
In collaboration with PRACE, address the skills gap in computational science in the targeted domain by specialised training and capacity building measures to develop the human capital resources for increased adoption of advanced HPC in industry (including SMEs) and academia;
Data management and long term data stewardship, in particular towards exascale;
Widening the access to codes and fostering transfer of know-how to user communities, including specific and targeted measures for industry and SMEs;
Business plans for long-term sustainability embracing a wide range of service models and funding options;
In collaboration with the support action foreseen for CoEs (specific challenge (b) of this topic), addressing the fragmentation of HPC activities for excellence in applications, and fostering the widening of the use of HPC codes in the EU
Proposals should include clear KPIs allowing the assessment and monitoring of the progress towards the objectives, both in terms of outputs and ultimate impact.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 6 and 8 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
(b) Coordination and Support Action
Proposals will address the following activities:
Coordinate the services (including e.g. consultancy to other organisations), training and skills development, and outreach activities for the CoE projects and potentially other initiatives and HPC stakeholders (e.g. PRACE), ensuring that best practices are shared;
Act as a clearing house for HPC training and consultancy, working with relevant stakeholders to ensure gaps are filled and overlaps avoided where possible;
Promote outreach to industry and SMEs, especially targeting specific industrial sectors and their events, and in view of supporting the INFRAINNOV-01-2019 action for stimulating the innovation potential of SMEs as users of advanced HPC services.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of up to EUR 2 million would allow this area to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
(a) Research and Innovation Actions
European leadership in exascale and extreme-scale -oriented codes and innovative algorithms/solutions that address societal challenges or are important for key scientific and industrial applications;
Improved access to computing applications and expertise that enables researchers and industry to be more productive, leading to scientific excellence and economic and social benefit;
Improved competitiveness for European companies and SMEs through access to CoE expertise and services;
Federating capabilities and integrating communities around computational science in Europe;
A large number of scientists and engineers, in particular female and young ones, trained in the use of computational methods and optimisation of applications.
(b) Coordination and Support Action
Access to consultancy and services (including training) offered by CoEs for external potential users and learners;
Maximise visibility and outreach of Centres of Excellence, in particular to industry;
Promoting the use of HPC by identifying industrial and SMEs users in the different business areas, and matching their needs with the available expertise in the CoEs;
Improved coordination and increased availability of training activities on HPC in Europe, in particular with PRACE.

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
European researchers need effective and convenient access to the best research infrastructures in order to conduct research for the advancement of knowledge and technology. The aim of this action is to bring together, integrate on European scale, and open up key national and regional research infrastructures to all European researchers, from both academia and industry, ensuring their optimal use and joint development.
Scope:
'Advanced Communities' are scientific communities whose research infrastructures show an advanced degree of coordination and networking at present, attained, in particular, through Integrating Activities awarded under FP7 or previous Horizon 2020 calls.
An Integrating Activity will mobilise a comprehensive consortium of several key research infrastructures in a given field as well as other stakeholders (e.g. public authorities, technological partners, research institutions) from different Member States, Associated Countries and other third countries[1] when appropriate, in particular when they offer complementary or more advanced services than those available in Europe.
Funding will be provided to support, in particular, the trans-national and virtual access provided to European researchers (and to researchers from Third Countries under certain conditions[2]), the cooperation between research infrastructures, scientific communities, industry and other stakeholders, the improvement of the services the infrastructures provide, the harmonisation, optimisation and improvement of access procedures and interfaces. Proposals should adopt the guidelines and principles of the European Charter for Access to Research Infrastructures.
To this extent, an Integrating Activity shall combine, in a closely co-ordinated manner:
(i) Networking activities, to foster a culture of co-operation between research infrastructures, scientific communities, industries and other stakeholders as appropriate, and to help develop a more efficient and attractive European Research Area;
(ii) Trans-national access or virtual access activities, to support scientific communities in their access to the identified key research infrastructures;
(iii) Joint research activities, to improve, in quality and/or quantity, the integrated services provided at European level by the infrastructures.
All three categories of activities are mandatory as synergistic effects are expected from these different components.
Access should be provided only to key research infrastructures of European interest, i.e., those infrastructures able to attract significant numbers of users from countries other than the country where they are located. Other national and regional infrastructures in Europe can be involved, in particular in the networking activities, for the exchange of best practices, without necessarily being beneficiaries in the proposal.
Proposals from advanced communities will have to clearly demonstrate the added value and the progress beyond current achievements in terms of integration and services, of a new grant. The strongest impact for advanced communities is expected typically to arise from focusing on innovation aspects and widening trans-national and virtual access provision, both in terms of wider and more advanced offer of scientific services, than in terms of number of users and domains served. Furthermore, in particular for communities supported in the past under three or more integrating activities, the creation of strategic roadmaps for future research infrastructure developments as well as the long-term sustainability of the integrated research infrastructure services provided at European level, need to be properly addressed. The latter requires the preparation of a sustainability plan beyond the grant lifecycle as well as, where appropriate, the involvement of funders.
In line with the strategy for EU international cooperation in research and innovation (COM(2012)497), Integrating Activities should, whenever appropriate, pay due attention to any related international initiative (i.e. outside the EU) and foster the use and deployment of global standards.
Integrating Activities should also organise the efficient curation, preservation and provision of access to the data collected or produced under the project, defining a data management plan, even when they opt out of the extended Pilot on Open Research Data. Data management (including ethics and privacy issues), interoperability, as well as advanced data and computing services should be addressed where relevant. To this extent, proposals should build upon the state of the art in ICT and e-infrastructures for data, computing and networking, and ensure connection to the European Open Science Cloud.
Integrating Activities should in particular contribute to fostering the potential for innovation, including social innovation, of research infrastructures by reinforcing the partnership with industry, through e.g. transfer of knowledge and other dissemination activities, activities to promote the use of research infrastructures by industrial researchers, involvement of industrial associations in consortia or in advisory bodies.
Integrating Activities are expected to duly take into account all relevant ESFRI and other world-class research infrastructures to exploit synergies, to reflect on sustainability and to ensure complementarity and coherence with the existing European Infrastructures landscape.
Proposals should include clear indicators allowing the assessment of the progress towards the general and specific objectives, other than the access provision.
As the scope of an integrating activity is to ensure coordination and integration between all the key European infrastructures in a given field and to avoid duplication of effort, advanced communities are expected to submit one proposal per area.
Further conditions and requirements that applicants should fulfil when drafting a proposal are given in part D of the section “Specific features for Research Infrastructures”. Compliance with these provisions will be taken into account during evaluation.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of up to EUR 10 million would allow this topic to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
On the basis of a multiannual plan drafted taking into account the assessment and the timing of previous grants as well as strategic priorities and needs, in term of research infrastructures services, emerging from other parts of Horizon 2020, this work programme invites proposals addressing the following areas listed under the different domains. A balanced coverage of the various domains, in line with the distribution of areas per domain, is expected as outcome of this topic.

Economies of scale and saving of resources are also realised due to common development and the optimisation of operations.
Innovation is fostered through a reinforced partnership of research organisations with industry.
A new generation of researchers is educated that is ready to optimally exploit all the essential tools for their research.
Closer interactions between larger number of researchers active in and around a number of infrastructures facilitate cross-disciplinary fertilisations and a wider sharing of information, knowledge and technologies across fields and between academia and industry.
For communities which have received three or more grants in the past, the sustainability of the integrated research infrastructure services they provide at European level is improved.
The integration of major scientific equipment or sets of instruments and of knowledge-based resources (collections, archives, structured scientific information, data infrastructures, etc.) leads to a better management of the continuous flow of data collected or produced by these facilities and resources.
When applicable, the integrated and harmonised access to resources at European level can facilitate the use beyond research and contribute to evidence-based policy making.
When applicable, the socio-economic impact of past investments in research infrastructures from the European Structural and Investment Funds is enhanced.

","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
European researchers need effective and convenient access to the best research infrastructures in order to conduct research for the advancement of knowledge and technology. The aim of this action is to bring together, integrate on European scale, and open up key national and regional research infrastructures to all European researchers, from both academia and industry, ensuring their optimal use and joint development.
Scope:
'Advanced Communities' are scientific communities whose research infrastructures show an advanced degree of coordination and networking at present, attained, in particular, through Integrating Activities awarded under FP7 or previous Horizon 2020 calls.
An Integrating Activity will mobilise a comprehensive consortium of several key research infrastructures[1] in a given field as well as other stakeholders (e.g. public authorities, technological partners, research institutions) from different Member States, Associated Countries and other third countries[2] when appropriate, in particular when they offer complementary or more advanced services than those available in Europe.
Funding will be provided to support, in particular, the trans-national and virtual access provided to European researchers (and to researchers from Third Countries under certain conditions), the cooperation between research infrastructures, scientific communities, industry and other stakeholders, the improvement of the services the infrastructures provide, the harmonisation, optimisation and improvement of access procedures and interfaces.
To this extent, an Integrating Activity shall combine, in a closely co-ordinated manner:
(i) Networking activities, to foster a culture of co-operation between research infrastructures, scientific communities, industries and other stakeholders as appropriate, and to help develop a more efficient and attractive European Research Area;
(ii) Trans-national access or virtual access activities, to support scientific communities in their access to the identified key research infrastructures;
(iii) Joint research activities, to improve, in quality and/or quantity, the integrated services provided at European level by the infrastructures.
All three categories of activities are mandatory as synergistic effects are expected from these different components.
Access should be provided only to key research infrastructures of European interest, i.e., those infrastructures able to attract significant numbers of users from countries other than the country where they are located. Other national and regional infrastructures in Europe can be involved, in particular in the networking activities, for the exchange of best practices, without necessarily being beneficiaries in the proposal.
Proposals from advanced communities will have to clearly demonstrate the added value and the progress beyond current achievements in terms of integration and services, of a new grant. The strongest impact for advanced communities is expected typically to arise from focusing on innovation aspects and widening trans-national and virtual access provision. Furthermore, in particular for communities supported in the past under three or more integrating activities, the creation of strategic roadmaps for future research infrastructure developments as well as the long-term sustainability of the integrated research infrastructure services provided at European level, need to be properly addressed. The latter requires the preparation of a sustainability plan beyond the grant lifecycle as well as, where appropriate, the involvement of funders.
In line with the strategy for EU international cooperation in research and innovation (COM(2012)497), Integrating Activities should, whenever appropriate, pay due attention to any related international initiative (i.e. outside the EU) and foster the use and deployment of global standards.
Integrating Activities should also organise the efficient curation, preservation and provision of access to the data collected or produced under the project, defining a data management plan, even when they opt out of the Pilot on Open Research Data. Data management (including ethics and privacy issues), interoperability, as well as advanced data and computing services should be addressed where relevant. To this extent, proposals should build upon the state of the art in ICT and e-infrastructures for data, computing and networking, working in cooperation with e-infrastructure service providers.
Integrating Activities should in particular contribute to fostering the potential for innovation, including social innovation, of research infrastructures by reinforcing the partnership with industry, through e.g. transfer of knowledge and other dissemination activities, activities to promote the use of research infrastructures by industrial researchers, involvement of industrial associations in consortia or in advisory bodies.
Integrating Activities are expected to duly take into account all relevant ESFRI and other world-class research infrastructures to exploit synergies, to reflect on sustainability and to ensure that rationally designed, comprehensive and coherent overall concepts for European Infrastructures are being pursued.
As the scope of an integrating activity is to ensure coordination and integration between all the key European infrastructures in a given field and to avoid duplication of effort, at most one proposal per area is expected to be submitted.
Further conditions and requirements that applicants should fulfil when drafting a proposal are given in part C of the section “Specific features for Research Infrastructures”. Compliance with these provisions will be taken into account during evaluation.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of up to EUR 10 million would allow this topic to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
On the basis of a multiannual plan drafted taking into account the assessment and the timing of previous grants as well as strategic priorities and needs, in term of research infrastructures services, emerging from other parts of Horizon 2020, this work programme invites proposals addressing the following areas listed under the different domains. A balanced coverage of the various domains, in line with the distribution of areas per domain, is expected as outcome of this topic.
Biological and Medical Sciences

It is expected that this community work towards close cooperation with relevant ESFRI Infrastructures. By developing their complementary nature, the different research infrastructures should answer broad scientific needs such as studies of the impact of atmospheric processes e.g. on regional photochemistry, global change, as well as cultural heritage and human health effects. Building on the former integrating initiatives, the development of a strategic integrating structure should also be considered.
Research infrastructures for forest ecosystem and resources research. This activity aims at integrating and facilitating broad access to forest research facilities and methodologies with a view to enabling, coordinating and harmonising research and monitoring including investigation of the biological effects of air pollution and mitigation and adaptation to climate change. Access should be provided to data on genetic and species diversity in forest ecosystems.

Research Infrastructures for hadron physics. This activity must provide and facilitate access to key research infrastructures in Europe for studying the properties of nuclear matter at extreme conditions, turning advances in hadron physics experimentation into new applications. It must present a long-term sustainable perspective on the integration of relevant facilities and related resources. Furthermore, it should also target new users and stimulate new scientific activities aimed at taking full advantage of new possibilities which will be offered by relevant initiatives on the ESFRI Roadmap, in particular FAIR.
Particle Accelerators. A project under this topic should facilitate access to state-of-the-art facilities to develop new techniques for improving the performance of existing and future accelerators. It should include accelerators for nuclear and particle physics and accelerator-based photon sources. It must present a long-term sustainable perspective on the integration of relevant facilities and related resources. A project under this topic should complement and further new scientific activities aimed at taking full advantage of new possibilities which will be offered by relevant initiatives on the ESFRI Roadmap.
Social Sciences and Humanities
Access to European Social Science Data Archives and Official Statistics. A project under this topic should aim at a further improvement of the researcher's access to official statistics. Work should address technologies for secured trans-national access to sensitive data. Synergies with relevant ESFRI Infrastructures, in particular CESSDA, should be duly exploited.
Research infrastructures for the study of poverty, working life and living conditions. The aim of this activity is to bring together research infrastructures serving European and international research in the fields of poverty, working life, and living conditions. It will compile historical data, and provide instruments for the analysis of the effects of employers’ behaviour and the evaluation of labour market and social policies targeted to vulnerable groups as well as offer training to researchers interested in the use of these instruments.
Expected Impact:
Researchers will have wider, simplified, and more efficient access to the best research infrastructures they require to conduct their research, irrespective of location. They benefit from an increased focus on user needs.
Operators of related infrastructures develop synergies and complementary capabilities, leading to improved and harmonised services. There is less duplication of services, leading to an improved use of resources across Europe. Economies of scale and saving of resources are also realised due to common development and the optimisation of operations.
Innovation is fostered through a reinforced partnership of research organisations with industry.
A new generation of researchers is educated that is ready to optimally exploit all the essential tools for their research.
Closer interactions between larger number of researchers active in and around a number of infrastructures facilitate cross-disciplinary fertilisations and a wider sharing of information, knowledge and technologies across fields and between academia and industry.
For communities which have received three or more grants in the past, the sustainability of the integrated research infrastructure services they provide at European level is improved.
The integration of major scientific equipment or sets of instruments and of knowledge-based resources (collections, archives, structured scientific information, data infrastructures, etc.) leads to a better management of the continuous flow of data collected or produced by these facilities and resources.
When applicable, the integrated and harmonised access to resources at European level can facilitate the use beyond research and contribute to evidence-based policy making.
When applicable, the socio-economic impact of past investments in research infrastructures from the European Structural and Investment Funds is enhanced.
Cross-cutting Priorities:
Gender
Socio-economic science and humanities

","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Research Infrastructures such as the ones on the ESFRI roadmap and others, are characterised by the very significant data volumes they generate and handle. These data are of interest to thousands of researchers across scientific disciplines and to other potential users via Open Access policies. Effective data preservation and open access for immediate and future sharing and re-use are a fundamental component of today’s research infrastructures and Horizon 2020 actions but researchers are still confronted with a fragmented research data landscape. The European Open Science Cloud (EOSC) will help addressing the current situation. Major stakeholders, such as the pan-European research infrastructures, must actively contribute to the setting up of its services.
Scope:
This topic will ensure the connection of the research infrastructures identified in the ESFRI Roadmap to the EOSC. Support to this activity will be provided through cluster projects gathering ESFRI projects and landmarks in each of the following large thematic domains: Biomedical Science, Environment and Earth Sciences, Physics and Analytical Facilities, Social Science and Humanities, Astronomy, Energy. While the ESFRI infrastructures represent the core component of any cluster, other relevant world class research infrastructures with a European dimension, established as ERICs or International Organisations, can also be involved in a cluster. Each infrastructure should participate to only one cluster.
Proposals will address the stewardship of data handled by the involved research infrastructures according to the FAIR[1] principles and in line with the objectives of Open Science. This will include the definition of domain specific data policies (e.g. acquisition, deposit, curation, preservation, access, sharing and re-use), addressing any legislative or interoperability issues which affect data handling across geographical and discipline borders, as well as the development of appropriate tools for depositing, curating and analysing data. Research infrastructures will have to expose their data and tools under the EOSC catalogue of services and take all the necessary steps to ensure that the used repositories are compliant with the FAIR principles. In doing so proposals should develop synergies and complementarity in data handling between research infrastructures, optimise technological implementation, and ensure integration and interoperability of data and tools within the EOSC.
Proposals may address the development of domain specific skills for data stewardships and the specific training of research infrastructure staff. Activities should contribute to a faster adoption of best practices and foster the use of open standards and interoperability in data and computing services. The detailed list of activities that can be supported under this topic is given in part C of the section “Specific features for Research Infrastructures”.
Consortia should include key participants of the involved infrastructures and/or the infrastructure legal entities as well as other partners needed to address the challenges or develop the required solutions. Proposals should build upon the state of the art in ICT and e-infrastructures for data, computing and networking and work in cooperation with e-infrastructure service providers.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 6 and 24 million would allow this challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts. The requested contribution should however be in line with the number of pan-European research infrastructures[2] the cluster aims to connect to the EOSC.
Expected Impact:
In line with the objectives of Open Science, improve access to data and tools enabling new and interdisciplinary research leading to new insights and innovation for the society at large
Facilitate access of researchers across all scientific disciplines to the broadest possible set of data and to other resources needed for data driven science to flourish.
Contribute to the creation of a cross-border and multi-disciplinary open innovation environment for research data, knowledge and services with engaged stakeholders and organisations.
Rise the efficiency and productivity of researchers thanks to an easier and seamless access to reliable and open data services and infrastructures for discovering, accessing, and reusing data;
Foster the establishment of global standards, ontologies and interoperability for scientific data.
Develop synergies and complementarity between involved research infrastructures, thus contributing to the development of a consistent European research infrastructures ecosystem.
Research communities adopt common approaches to the data management lifecycle (data and metadata curation), which leads to economies of scale.

","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Fostering targeted international co-operation is essential to promote e-infrastructure interoperation at global level allowing European communities to link with third countries, contribute to standardisation activities in international fora, to align strategic developments and share best practices. To optimise e-infrastructure investments in Europe it is essential to coordinate European, national and/or regional policies and programmes for e-infrastructures in order to develop complementarities and promote cooperation between e-infrastructures and related EU policies.
Scope:
Proposals will address part (a) or (b), but not both:
(a) Research and Innovation Actions for International Co-operation on high-end e-infrastructure requirements
Together with other countries in the world, European Member States are leading partners in the construction of the forthcoming Square Kilometre Array (SKA) radio telescope. SKA will generate huge amounts of data and a significant part will be made available online. Efficient processing and computation of the large volume of data are significant challenges and global co-operation is essential. SKA has the potential to drive innovation in query and knowledge creation on large databases, high performance computing, and communications and networking technologies.
Proposals bringing together key international partners should address all of the following aspects:
Define and test the high-speed networking e-infrastructure architecture, components and services to respond to the bandwidth requirements for SKA data dissemination channels.
Define and test computational requirements and architectures in terms of High-Performance Computing, distributed computing, storage e-infrastructures and services in order for the scientific community to be able to exploit SKA data.
Foster global co-operation on management e-infrastructure and services for the exploitation of SKA data through joint efforts on global interoperability in the context of the Research Data Alliance (RDA).
Further conditions and requirements that applicants should fulfil when drafting a proposal are given in part D of the section “Specific features for Research Infrastructures”. Compliance with these provisions will be taken into account during evaluation.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU between EUR 1.5 and 3 million would allow this activity to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
(b) Coordination and Support actions for international co-operation and policy development
Proposals will address only one of the points below. At least one proposal for each point will be selected:
1. International Co-operation on e-infrastructure supporting major societal challenges: International cooperation involving different third countries, to facilitate the development of globally interoperable e-infrastructures ensuring their global reach, innovation, skill development and sharing of lessons learned. Co-operation with third countries on interoperability of e-infrastructures for networking, computing and data in order to support joint-efforts on one or more major societal challenges (e.g.: health, agriculture, education/skills, etc.). Innovation and spin-off of technology for developing and developed countries and emerging economies to establish a platform for sharing information and best practices on e-infrastructure development, deployment and operation.
Proposals should address all the following aspects:
Define one or more key societal challenge that has significant potential of maximising benefit of e-infrastructure across developing, developed and emerging economies,
Organise a platform for sharing information and best practices,
Identify and explore spin-off and innovation, in particular with the co-operation of developing and developed countries.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU between EUR 0.5 and 1 million would allow this activity to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
2. Policy support to e-infrastructure programme: Support the e-IRG[1] secretariat. The activities should include the collection and aggregation of relevant policy information with impact on the development of EC-funded e-infrastructures, including KPIs and cost-related information, in coordination with the funded e-infrastructure initiatives and made available in open formats for reuse. The collected information will enable the e-IRG with the support of independent expert panels to provide strategic advice on the evolution of the European e-infrastructures landscape and associated costs.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU between EUR 0.5 and 1 million would allow this activity to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
3. Support to dissemination for the e-infrastructure programme: Develop and maintain dissemination and collaboration activities for information sharing among projects and stakeholders. They should include a web-portal to convey updated information related to the evolution of e-infrastructures at regional, national and European levels, with a special focus on e-infrastructure projects funded under Horizon 2020. The portal will be a vehicle to present to experts and the wider public the catalogue of services offered by e-infrastructures as well as service-related KPIs and costs (see point above). It should support monitoring activities on take-up of open science and e-infrastructures policies (e.g. Horizon 2020 Open Research Data Pilot by research communities and citizens, per country, region and research domain).
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU between EUR 1 and 1.5 million would allow this activity to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
4. Support to small-size foresight roadmaps for the e-infrastructure programme: Support small-size foresight roadmaps for research and education communities and operators of e-infrastructure services to define long-term requirements, community-building and identification of potential collaboration from stakeholders across different geographic areas and scientific domains.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU between EUR 300 and 400 thousand would allow this activity to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
(a) Research and Innovation Actions for International Co-operation on high-end e-infrastructure requirements: The impact of successful proposals will lead to the improvement of co-operation on e-infrastructures with European partners that are joining efforts in major research infrastructure undertakings. It will help the identification of benefits of joint technology development, standardisation and sharing risks.
(b) Coordination and Support Actions for International Co-operation and Policy Development:
International Co-operation on e-infrastructure supporting major societal challenges: will exploit the potential for further economic and educational co-operation between Europe and third countries. It will also improve the identification of areas for further co-operation on scientific development and innovation. The actions will provide mechanisms to assess measurable benefits of co-operation on major societal challenges in the developing countries.
Policy support to e-infrastructure programme: Support actions provide solid ground for future choices for a comprehensive European Research Infrastructure and especially e-infrastructure policy and enable decision making and deployment of e-infrastructures. Successful collaboration between all projects under the H2020 e-infrastructure funding brings together all key stakeholders, and enables finding further synergies towards a harmonised European e-infrastructure approach.
Support to dissemination for the e-infrastructure programme: improve awareness and knowledge about priorities of e-Infrastructures activities and strategies increasing the transparency and accountability of the workprogramme implementation.
Support to small-size foresight roadmaps for the e-infrastructure programme: improve the knowledge base for setting long-term e-infrastructure strategies and objectives.

","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
In the context of the communication for a reinforced ERA partnership for excellence and growth[1], the focus of the policy support measures is related to the effective investment and use of research infrastructures. Following the communication of the Commission on International Cooperation in Research and Innovation (COM(2012)497), international cooperation for research infrastructures is needed with a number of key third countries/regions seen as strategic for the development, exploitation and management of world-class research infrastructures necessary to address research challenges with a global dimension.
Scope:
Proposals will address only one of the following areas:
Develop a model describing the socio-economic impact of Research Infrastructures and of their related financial investments. The model should be adaptable to a broad range of scientific domains and types of infrastructures. It should contribute to a common approach at international level and facilitate investments in Research Infrastructures by funding agencies and other stakeholders. Proposals will take stock of the different existing models for research infrastructures and integrate, as appropriate, their findings in one single model. The activity should take into account the work of the Research Infrastructure Socio-Economic Impact Working group, being established by the OECD Global Science Forum, and involve major key international players in this domain.
European support to the Research Data Alliance, RDA: Proposals are expected to support the development of global interoperable research data infrastructures that will greatly benefit the coordination at European level addressing all the points below. The objective is (a) support to the RDA secretariat for logistics, open access to RDA reference documents and dissemination activities (b) support the emergence of building blocks of an open, interoperable data infrastructure fostering interoperability across regions, organisations and scientific disciplines (c) support ESFRI infrastructures and new communities to engage in Open Science and data sharing principles. In particular, the proposal activities should provide financial support of the organisation and coordination of European stakeholders' active participation and contribution to the Research Data Alliance[2].
At least a proposal per area will be selected. The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of up to EUR 1.5 million for the first area and between EUR 3 and 3.5 million for the second area (RDA) would allow this topic to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
This activity will help to:
Develop cooperation with key international partners for research infrastructures;
Enhance the role of the Union in international organisations and multilateral fora.
For the first area (model for socio-economic impact) further expected impact of the action is the enhancement of partnerships between policy makers, funding bodies, academia and industry and the promotion of the development of appropriate tools in support of decision making.
For the second area (European support to RDA) further expected impact of the action is the following: Europe will be in a leading position in enabling the use of the world's store of research data in multi-disciplinary, data intensive global scientific collaborations. It will help the development and adoption of relevant international open standards based on the best practices of a large spectrum of research communities. It will engage research communities at early stages of standards development and address common data requirements for new services bringing together users and technology providers. It will promote sustainable models for research data sharing and install trust in the adopted solutions.

","11 December 2013
","single-stage
Deadline date","Scope:
Specific challenge: The complexity of research infrastructures and the exploitation of their full potential require adequate skills for their managers, engineers and technicians, as well as users. Research infrastructures are built and operated at the cutting edge of what is technologically feasible, involving a high associated risk that needs to be managed. They may involve a multitude of partners in a consortium that fund and perform their construction and operation, either because they are distributed research infrastructures, or because certain problems are of a scale that can only be tackled by means of European and international cooperation. This renders their governance and the associated financial and legal issues a complex problem. Comparable issues are not usually faced by research institutions that do not operate research infrastructures, or in fields that do not yet have a long tradition of using research infrastructures. The skills and expertise specifically needed to construct, operate and use research infrastructures successfully therefore are not widely available.
EU funding will support the training of staff managing and operating research infrastructures of European interest, the exchange of staff and best practices between facilities, and the adequate supply of human resources in key disciplines, including the emergence of specific education.
While the human capital dimension will be embedded under other lines of activity of the research infrastructures work programme, specific actions will be needed to foster coordination across domains and types of infrastructures.
Scope: The activity will support the training of staff managing and operating research infrastructures. A proposal under this topic should build on the past activities and the experience gained in the projects such as RAMIRI (Realising and Managing International Research Infrastructures). It should engage with universities and prepare curricula and courses specifically for pan-European research infrastructures to address their intercultural and interdisciplinary nature as well as their diversity (global, highly distributed, single site etc.). A significant use of interactive online training material should be considered.
Expected impact:  This activity will improve and professionalise the training of the staff managing and operating research infrastructures of European interest, strengthen the human capital of the involved research infrastructures, stimulating their efficient management and therefore promoting their development and competitiveness at national, European and international level.

Deadline date","Scope:
Specific challenge: The changing methods of (digital) science and research require that researchers, professors and students receive adequate support in computing and networking, as well as in handling, analysing and storing large amounts of digital content. Formal education for emerging professions of e-infrastructure operators, research technologists (including those possessing computational skills, e.g. in parallel programming), data scientists or ""data librarians"" hardly exists today. Professional recognition of these communities and the development of appropriate curricula, training and skills are crucial to ensure effective services to institution staff and students. Training opportunities should be available at all levels and for all communities potentially engaged in research and innovation related activities.
Scope: Proposals should address one or more of the following areas:
(1) Defining or updating university curricula for the e-infrastructure competences mentioned above, and promoting their adoption.
(2) Developing and executing training programmes (including for lifelong learning) for the above mentioned professionals working as part of a team of researchers or supporting research teams.
(3) Support the establishment of these professions as distinct professions from that of a researcher. Create a reference model which defines their competencies, supported by case studies and best practices relating to e-infrastructures skills, human resources management, support tools and related institutional practices. Develop alternatives means for recognising non-research contributions by research technologists and data scientists.
(4) Support networking and information sharing among already practicing e-infrastructure experts, research technologists, computation experts, data scientists and data librarians working in research institutes and in higher education.
(5) Awareness raising activities; establish and promote e-infrastructures community champions to advocate on new jobs and skills needs at schools, universities and scientific communities.
Expected impact:  The number of high level education institutions offering degrees for e-infrastructure experts, research technologists, data scientists and data librarians will increase. Graduates and practitioners in these fields will have access to degrees, programmes and information sharing tools to improve their skills. The majority of European researchers will thus have access to training on e-infrastructures to develop related skills. The number of individuals able to design, develop and maintain e-science tools and services as well as to support researchers with computational and data expertise will increase significantly.

Scope:
Proposals will address one of the following areas:
Support Research Infrastructure policy development in terms of exchange of best practices for national Roadmap drafting and evaluation procedures for research infrastructures in order to promote comparability and synchronisation of national procedures and a possible harmonisation of ex-ante and ex-post evaluation mechanisms. The full lifecycle of research infrastructure funding should be duly taken into account. The proposals shall foresee the conduction of an analysis of existing national roadmaps so to extrapolate common trends that could be then proposed as best practices in terms of criteria for inclusion, and for addressing societal needs with cross-cutting/multi-disciplinary approaches. The activity should foresee, amongst other, the organisation of dedicated workshops with the relevant key players both at national and European level (with specific reference to ESFRI and the e-IRG) for validation of the findings and recommendations.
Conduct an International landscaping exercise for Research Infrastructures to support the EU strategy of International cooperation in this field. Such exercise should build on the ESFRI landscaping exercise. The proposals should demonstrate the added value of the pan European investments in terms of establishing, as appropriate, complementarities to non-European initiatives and should link, as appropriate, to the relevant European and International bodies (i.e. ESFRI, GSO, OECD/GSF).
Support to trans-disciplinary bilateral cooperation on research infrastructures with Africa. The proposal will build on the past experience and achievements gained in the FP7 project PAERIP (Promoting African – European Research Infrastructure Partnerships), taking also into account the recommendations deriving from the EU-Africa High Level Policy Dialogue (HLPD) on science, technology and innovation that has initially focused on food and nutrition security and sustainable agriculture. Proposals should allow to further landscape the research infrastructure dimension in Africa and identify domains in which cooperation between research infrastructures would be beneficial to consequently developing roadmaps for cooperation. Appropriate involvement of African participants is encouraged and will be taken into account during evaluation. The proposals should in particular:
Identify and promote opportunities (access and data sharing) available to European scientists in these research infrastructures;
Help to develop better coordination and cooperation of European research infrastructures with their non-European counterparts, ensuring their global interoperability and reach, and pursuing international agreements on the reciprocal use, openness or co-financing of infrastructures;
Support the training needs of the Synchrotron light for Experimental Science and Applications (SESAME) facility located in Jordan and the staff exchange with other European light source infrastructures to ensure its optimal use by the research community for world-class research.
A balanced coverage of the various areas is expected as outcome of this topic. The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 1.5 and 2 million would allow this topic to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
This activity will:
Strengthen the development of a consistent and dynamic European Research Area policy for research infrastructures;
Facilitate the exchange of experiences and good practices between the national and/or regional policies and programmes;
Enhance partnerships between policy makers, funding bodies, academia and industry and promote the development of appropriate monitoring tools for decision making;
Contribute to the emergence of sustainable approaches for the provision of cross-disciplinary research services;
Encourage the pooling of resources between infrastructure operators at European level in order to face the grand challenges and to foster a culture of co-operation between them, spreading good practices and encouraging infrastructures to develop in complementary ways.
Develop cooperation with key international partners for research infrastructures;
Contribute to the development of a competitive high performance ERA in the global research environment;

Deadline date","Scope:
Specific challenge: The Balkans represent an interesting neighbouring region for the EU from geographic as well as from political and historical perspectives. Following Slovenia´s accession to the Union in 2004 and since the launch of the Stabilisation and Association Process (SAP) in 2000, only Croatia has become an EU Member State in July 2013. All the other Balkan countries have the prospect of becoming Member States and are bilaterally engaged with the EU through Stabilisation and Association Agreements (SAA) (i.e. Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Montenegro, Kosovo[1] and Serbia). On its way toward EU membership, each country undergoes individual review processes to meet the reform requirements and comply with the so-called EU acquis. In addition, challenges which reflect to a large extent the socio-economic, political, cultural, religious and ethnic diversity of the Balkans have to be addressed and overcome. In its attempts at supporting a transformation toward political and socio-economic stability in the Balkans, the EU is therefore faced with a high degree of complexity.
Scope: Research should include stock-taking of existing relations between the EU and each of the countries in the Balkans as well as between these countries inter se. It should explicitly adopt the perspective of the examined countries so as to promote the understanding within the EU of the region its history and challenges. Key issues such as socio-economic and democratic development, identity politics, challenges of state building, linguistic and cultural diversity,  ethnic conflicts as well as gender equality and migration should be addressed. Moreover, research should examine if and how scientific cooperation and the mobility of researchers can contribute to an increased understanding between EU actors and the countries and people of the region and to addressing societal challenges of shared concern. The role of macro-regional strategies (e.g. the EU Strategy for the Danube Region) and of other strategic powers in this region, like the USA, Russia and Turkey, should also be analysed. Based on the research findings, EU policy options vis-à-vis each country in the Balkans and the region as a whole should be assessed, taking into account the broader geo-strategic environment.
Broad participation of partners from the Balkan countries in proposals submitted to this call is strongly encouraged.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 1.5 and 2.5 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected impact: Research should allow for a comprehensive understanding of the  Balkans, taking into account the current state of each country’s relations with the EU as well as the cultural, political and socio-economic conditions in the region. By adopting both an inside-out and an outside-in perspective on the EU's relations with the actors in this region, research should also enable a critical assessment of the Union's external policy - its overarching strategy, the tools it employs and their impacts - vis-à-vis the individual Balkan countries and the region as a whole. Research findings can ultimately be expected to identify best practices and shape the EU's enlargement policy and strategies vis-à-vis this region and to possibly include recommendations on how to further enhance their effectiveness for the benefit of both the Balkans and the EU.

Deadline date","Scope:
Specific challenge: A shared history, as well as cultural, political and economic ties, closely connect Europe and Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC). Individual countries enjoy close bilateral relations, and cooperation at regional and sub-regional level is gaining momentum.
At bi-regional level, the Strategic Partnership between the EU and LAC was launched in Rio de Janeiro in 1999 and has gradually been upgraded into the current EU-CELAC[1] Partnership. Aided by this process, the two regions have cooperated on a wide range of issues in a number of sectors, including those identified by the EU-CELAC Action Plan and more particularly the Joint Initiative for Research and Innovation (JIRI) adopted at the Madrid Summit in 2010.
Today, the European Union is the leading investor in the region, the second largest trading partner after the U.S.A. and a major provider of development cooperation assistance. However, beyond the economic relationship, the EU-CELAC cooperation needs to reinforce the cultural, scientific and social ties and common vision between the two world regions.
Scope: Research under this topic should critically examine past and present cultural, scientific, intellectual and social exchanges between individuals, countries and regions within the wide EU-CELAC area, with a view to determining synergies and cross-fertilization, as well as identifying asymmetries in bi-lateral and bi-regional relations.
The cultural exchanges between EU and LAC should be studied, as for instance those brought about through long-standing migration movements between the two regions, as well as those taking place in fields such as arts, literature, sports and beyond. Scientific exchanges between EU and LAC should also be examined in an historical and forward-looking perspective and research should look at how mobility of researchers and cooperation between research institutions and laboratories can contribute to an increased understanding and cooperation between the two sides. Research could also shed light on how LAC representative groups of citizens perceive the role of Europe in their own continent and the process of European integration, more generally.
The social dimension of the EU-CELAC relation should also be taken into consideration. Research could look at the impact of the EU-CELAC relation on the promotion of social cohesion in the two regions and at how different approaches to fight social exclusion and regional disparities can be successfully shared and applied to different contexts.
Research should be focused on those areas that are deemed crucial to explain the current state of play of relations between EU and LAC, and those that are considered strategic for future interaction and cooperation between the two regions.
Proposals shall include at least three legal entities established in three different LAC countries. However, an even broader participation of international partners from the LAC countries in proposals submitted to this call is encouraged.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 1.5 and 2.5 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected impact: Research under this topic will provide a better understanding of the cultural, scientific and social dimension of the relationship between the EU and LAC, thus supporting the process of EU-CELAC cooperation outlined by the EU-CELAC Action Plan 2013-2015 in defining a common vision for the years to come.
Research will contribute to the understanding of the role of social actors in both societies and to encourage mutual knowledge between the two regions, thus feeding into the work of the EU-LAC Foundation[2]. Research is also expected to inform the on-going bi-regional networking activities of the JIRI and the work of the Trans-Atlantic Platform for the Social Sciences and Humanities (T-AP).

","single-stage
Deadline date","Scope:
Specific challenge: At a time when other major global players, such as China or South Korea, are stepping up their public diplomacy efforts around cultural issues, including science and education, cultural diplomacy is also of increasing interest in the European Union. While there is a strong history of cultural diplomacy both within Europe and between Europe and the wider world, a  number of recent initiatives have been launched by the European Commission and the European Parliament to reinforce the link between EU foreign and cultural policies. The Commission's ""European Agenda for Culture in a Globalising World"" has led to the establishment of a Member States' expert group on culture and external relations (taking China as a test case), which has delivered a report with recommendations. Following its 2011 resolution on “Cultural dimensions of EU external actions”, the European Parliament has launched a Preparatory Action on culture in external relations, implemented by the Commission.These initiatives are based on the assumption that European cultural heritage and the long-standing experience with protecting it, as well as European science, need to be promoted, and therefore included in a broader global strategy.
Effective and coherent EU cultural and science diplomacy cannot only be a major means of furthering inter-cultural dialogues with third countries and regions, but it can also help in promoting trade in (cultural) goods and services to and from the EU as a basis for building relationships.
Moreover, it provides a significant tool for projecting Europe's immensely rich and diverse cultural heritage to the world and of allowing the EU to contribute to the global governance of culture and science. Inversely, cultural and scientific exchanges can also contribute to facilitating diplomatic relations and cultural diplomacy can be (co-)delivered by actors in a “bottom up” manner.
Scope: Research should analyse and compare in depth EU and EU Member States’ bi- and multilateral cultural relations with major third countries and regions in EU's neighbourhood and beyond, as well as international organizations. It should emphasize the institutional set-up, aims, processes and contents of the EU's external cultural activities and how cultural issues are embedded into its external relations more generally as well as examine how successful these activities are in building relationships. As part of this exercise, science and technology cooperation - as significant complement of cultural diplomacy - should explicitly be examined. The role of the Council of Europe and the multilateral dimensions of global cultural relations within UNESCO should equally be investigated.
Special attention should be paid to the role of non-governmental and private sector organisations as well as cooperation of cultural professionals and scientists. Research could compare the EU and its Member States with other major, and often very active global players (e.g. the US, China or South Korea). The broader social, political and economic developments that EU activities in the cultural and scientific domain are embedded into should be accounted for when researching this issue.
The participation of international partners in proposals submitted to this call is encouraged.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 1.5 and 2.5 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected impact: Research that will look into the evolutionary nature of multiple cultural ties between Europe and specific countries and world regions, also from a historical perspective, is expected to furnish a critical overview of the existing EU and Member State external cultural and science policies. It will explore incentives for joint action and reveal possibilities for achieving synergies and coordination. It will highlight best practices and effective cooperation, but also inconsistences and shortcomings in political and economic terms. The findings will contribute to a better understanding of the potential for and challenges facing European Union cultural and scientific diplomacy and the embedding of culture into its external relations more widely. They will allow for drawing policy implications on the set-up, the role of different EU institutions and services in, as well as the contents and processes of such diplomacy.

Specific challenge: Smart, inclusive and sustainable growth in the EU cannot be achieved without substantial contribution of its rural areas. The key challenge is to foster a balanced development of rural areas by enabling them to capitalize on their distinctive territorial capital and thus 'turn diversity into strength'. Social innovation relates to the development of new forms of organisations and interactions to respond to societal challenges. It is a collective learning process in which different social groups and actors participate and which results in new skills and practices as well as in new attitudes, values, behaviours and governance mechanisms. Although social innovation is considered as an enabler for a transition towards sustainable agriculture and rural development, there is limited empirical evidence of the extent and outcomes of social innovations and on the supporting conditions.  Little is known as to how to support social innovation, in particular in marginalised rural areas where the social structure is most fragile. This also raises the challenge of promoting institutional capacity building in these areas, at different levels, to develop the social capital and skills required to support the creation of successful social innovation. 
Scope: Proposals should undertake a thorough analysis of social innovation in agriculture, forestry and rural development, encompassing its complexity and various dimensions as well as its impact on unfolding the territorial capital in different regional contexts. Proposals should establish appropriate methods for the evaluation of social innovation.  Attention needs to be given to different learning arrangements (e.g. multi-actor networks, producer-consumer association, hybrid innovative networks, territorial alliances) as well as to innovative governance mechanisms at various levels, and their potential implications for social innovation. Proposals should also address the role of different policy instruments, other relevant incentives and diverse entities (public/private, local/non local, active citizens, etc.) as catalysts/constraints to social innovation. Proposals should explain why regions with similar initial conditions display diverging paths. Activities should cover diverse types of rural areas across the EU and Associated Countries and non-European Mediterranean countries. In line with the objectives of the EU strategy for international cooperation in research and innovation, proposals are encouraged to include third country participants, especially those established in Mediterranean countries[1].
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU in the range of EUR 5-6 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected impact:
         clarify the different dimensions of social innovation and its dynamics in agriculture, forestry and rural development
         Identify pathways to unfold the territorial capital of rural regions and thus shape sustainable development trajectories in different types of rural areas
         support more sustainable agri-food and forestry systems and rural development, thus contributing in the medium term to smart, inclusive and sustainable growth in rural areas
         improve territorial governance and pave the way for an integrated approach to rural development (i.e. ensuring effective mechanisms to coordinate different policies and establish appropriate linkages with other areas).
         deliver analyses of different innovative governance mechanisms with respect to social innovation in different contexts
         allow policy makers and the local communities to improve the formulation and delivery of relevant policies as well as to shape such programmes that explicitly foster the creation of sustainable social innovations.

","26 June 2014","Scope:
Specific challenge:Traditionally, agricultural and forestry activities have been the provider of manifold – often underappreciated – public goods including ecosystem services. In view of the expected rise in primary production and more intensive production methods, the provision of public goods by agriculture and forestry is threatened, the more since these are considered to be 'non-excludable', 'non-rival' and therefore without market value. Although the term 'public goods' is widely used, the concept lacks an operational framework and a common understanding as regards the wider societal and non-market benefits of agriculture and forestry activities – in particular in the context of dynamic changes in land use and farming systems. Thorough evidence on the nature, extent and function of public goods provided by agriculture and forestry – including those of global nature - is required to identify demand as well as to create effective incentives and policy options for their continued provision.
Scope:Proposals should develop a systematic and operational framework to map, characterize and quantify the variety of public goods provided by agricultural and forestry ecosystems throughout Europe. This will include identifying links between economic activities in the primary production sectors and the delivery of public goods (including conflicting demands) as well as important 'disservices' of agriculture resulting in trade-offs as regards the provision of public goods. Proposals should take into account various temporal and spatial scales, different types of cropping, husbandry and forest management systems as well as the diversity and dynamics of climatic, natural, cultural and socio-economic conditions all over the EU. Furthermore, proposals should consider ways in which to valorise and establish effective support measures (policies, incentives, public services) for the delivery of public goods in response to societal expectations. Information and dissemination activities should target a wide range of stakeholders including from policy making, the farming and forestry sectors and allow for their active participation.  
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU in the range of EUR 2–3 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected impact:
increased understanding of  the nature of management and other processes that influence the delivery of public goods by different types of farming and forestry systems in Europe (e.g. by means of a solid inventory)
development of robust mechanisms and tools for a) measuring and valorising public goods (including in terms of value streams, as relevant) as well as for b) establishing the contributions of the agricultural and forestry sectors to the sustained delivery of these goods
formulation of appropriate policies, incentives, service models and win-win scenarios to reduce conflicts between productivity objectives in primary production and the delivery of ecosystems services and other public goods
overall, increased sustainability of primary production by reducing the negative impacts and enhancing the positive contributions of the agriculture and forestry sectors to public goods

","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
The challenge is to foster the deployment of IoT solutions in Europe through integration of advanced IoT technologies across the value chain, demonstration of multiple IoT applications at scale and in a usage context, and as close as possible to operational conditions. Compared to existing solutions, the roadblocks to overcome include i) the integration and further research and development where needed of the most advanced technologies across the value chain (components, devices, networks, middleware, service platforms, application functions) and their operation at large scale to respond to real needs of end-users (public authorities, citizens and business), based on underlying open technologies and architectures that may be reused across multiple use cases and enable interoperability across those; ii) the validation of user acceptability by addressing, in particular, issues of trust, attention, security and privacy through pre-defined privacy and security impact assessments, liability, coverage of user needs in the specific real-life scenarios of the pilot, iii) the validation of the related business models to guarantee the sustainability of the approach beyond the project.
Scope:
Pilots are targeted, goal driven initiatives that will propose IoT approaches to specific real-life industrial/societal challenges. Pilots are autonomous entities that involve stakeholders from supply side to demand side, and contain all the technological and innovation elements, the tasks related to the use, application and deployment as well as the development, testing and integration activities. Large scale validation is characterised by the fact that it will be possible to operate the functional entities implemented in the pilot under load and constraints conditions close to operational load one's, either with real traffic/request/processing loads, or with emulated loads where full implementation is not possible. Demonstration to operate the system across multiple sites, scalability to large amount of heterogeneous devices and systems, as well as with large amount of real users are expected. Pilot work plans should include feedback mechanisms to allow adaptation and optimisation of the technological and business approach to the particular use case.
Use of experimental testbeds, such as FIRE[1], and real-world demonstrations may support IoT technologies validation before they are deployed in field trials. Given the considerable amount of work carried out on M2M/IoT and Cyber Physical Systems architectures (e.g. IoT-A) open platforms (e.g. FIWARE, CRYSTAL, UniversAAL) and standards (e.g. oneM2M) over the last few years, pilots are encouraged to exploit this previous work where applicable with the objective of further demonstrating the generic applicability and interoperability of these and/or other architectures, platforms and standards, and to identify where standards are missing or should evolve, as well as needed pre-normative activities.
IoT finds applicability in a broad range of industry, business and public services scenarios. On the basis of European relevance, technology readiness and socio-economic interest the following areas have been identified to be addressed with Large Scale IoT Pilots.
Pilot 1: Smart living environments for ageing well
The objective is to deploy innovative and user-led pilot projects capable of supporting and extending independent living at home for older adults based on Internet of Things (IoT) technologies. The smart living environments should be based upon an integrated system of a range of IoT-based technologies and services with user-friendly configuration and management of connected technologies for homes and outside.
They should provide seamless services and handle flexible connectivity while users are switching contexts and moving in their living environments. The proposed pilots should also demonstrate feasibility of integration with other relevant application domains such as energy, transport, or smart cities. The solutions shall build upon advanced IoT technologies, using and extending available open service platforms, standardised ontologies and open standardised APIs. Proposals shall address integration, standardisation and interoperability work on required ICT platforms, services and data sources, as well as on innovation in organisational and business models for service delivery.
Proposed solutions should take into account the specific requirements for accessibility, usability, cost efficiency, personalisation and adaptation arising from this application sector. They should be based on active user engagement from the outset and should involve a multi-disciplinary approach in order to ensure the understanding of user needs and their evolution, safeguarding ethics and privacy and the assessment of impact. This should include quality of life for older adults and their carers, care system efficiency gains, business and financing models and organisational changes required for service delivery.
A clear methodology for socio-economic impact assessment should be included. Large scale pilots should demonstrate the benefits of smart living environments based on IoT in terms of prolonged independent and safe living of older adults at home with good quality of life. The number of users involved and duration of pilot services should be sufficient to ensure statistical significance in impact analysis, with a minimum of 4 pilot sites in 4 countries.
Pilot 2: Smart Farming and Food Security
The implementation of Precision Agriculture has become possible thanks to the development of sophisticated sensors, robots and sensor networks combined with procedures to link mapped variables to appropriate farming management actions. Those sensors, either wired or wireless, integrated into an IoT system gather all the individual data needed for monitoring, control and treatment on farms located in a particular region. Such future Internet of Things scenario would bring data management to a new level by establishing interactions between the concerned objects, help them exchange information in efficient ways and enable them to execute autonomously appropriate interventions in different agricultural sub-sectors (e. g. arable crops, livestock , vegetable and fruit production) and their associated post-production value chain through to the consumer. The introduction of the IoT scenario would allow monitoring and control of plant and animal products during the whole life cycle from farm to fork. It should thereby also help farmers' decision making with regard to the use of inputs and management processes. The challenge is to design architectures to “program” or track each object for optimal behaviour, according to its role in the Smart Farming system and in the overall food chain, decreasing use of water as well as other natural resources and inputs, lowering ecological footprints and economic costs as well as increasing food security. It also enables consumers to access trustworthy traceability information throughout the whole food chain.
Proposals shall include an adequate combination of different farms to ensure that the deployment of the technology is adapted to the needs of different types and sizes of farms across Europe. Activities should allow for a wide geographic coverage within Europe and benefit both conventional and organic agro-food chains. In addition, proposals shall cover at least three sub-sectors (e.g.arable crops, livestock, vegetable and fruit production).
Proposals should fall under the concept of multi-actor approach[2] and allow for adequate involvement of the farming sector in the proposed activities.
Pilot 3: Wearables for smart ecosystems
Demonstration of innovative wearable solutions and services integrated in interoperable IoT ecosystems. Wearables are integrating key technologies (e.g. nano-electronics, organic electronics, sensing, actuating, localization, communication, energy harvesting, low power computing, visualisation and embedded software) into intelligent systems to bring new functionalities into clothes, fabrics, patches, watches and other body-mounted devices. They assist humans in monitoring, situational awareness and decision making. Particular attention should be devoted to actuating functions providing whenever feasible fully automated closed-loop solutions. Prototype development and demonstration are expected for healthcare, well-being, safety, security and infotainment applications. Actions should be driven by concrete business cases, open design approaches and user requirements, taking into account data protection and liability concerns. They should involve the actors of the entire innovation value chain, potentially including creative and artistic actors, and aim at demonstrations in real world settings. The number of users involved should be sufficient to ensure statistical significance in impact analysis.
Pilot 4: Reference zones in EU cities
Building on the past results and achievements[3] in some cities in Europe, a large scale pilot will cover a series of cities to operate as reference zones for showcasing and experimenting new citizen-centred IoT services. Starting from users' expressed preferences and needs, these cities will experiment and test similar new services and solutions, also through involvement of creativity hubs such as fablabs, co-working spaces, and gather experience at scale and evaluate citizens' acceptability and endorsement. It will enable SMEs to use open demonstrators to test innovative new services. This includes advanced solutions for traditional services' provisioning e.g. water management but also solutions that are at the edge of authorised business practices or regulation (ex: sharing of electricity, autonomous vehicles) and thus require dedicated testing zones. Whenever applicable, pilots will provide evidence of access to city areas where legal contexts are adapted to the demonstration requirements (i.e. 'reference zones'). Federation and interoperability between platforms may be considered as appropriate, as well as the ability to integrate data from different service providers. The number of users involved and duration of pilot services should be sufficient to ensure statistical significance in impact analysis, with a minimum of 4 pilot sites in 4 countries.
Pilot 5: Autonomous vehicles in a connected environment
The pilot addresses the added value and the potential of applying IoT for autonomous vehicles in a connected environment.
It should test scenarios of deployment of safe and highly and fully autonomous vehicles (up to SAE[4] international level 5, full automation) in various representative use case scenarios, exploiting local and distributed information and intelligence. Core technologies include reliable and real-time platforms managing mixed criticality car services, advanced sensors and Internet information sources around which value-added apps may be constructed, efficient navigation and improved decision-making technology, interconnectivity between vehicles, vehicle to infrastructure communication. Using advanced technologies for connectivity is seen as an asset. The selected scenarios will provide proofs of concept showing how such technology provides benefits affecting users on a daily basis, for instance on the highways or in urban congested environment, either on dedicated lanes or mixing autonomous connected vehicles and legacy vehicles. To make a real step towards future large scale deployment and to demonstrate dependability, robustness and resilience of the technology over longer period of time and under a large variety of conditions, priority will be given to permanent installations and sustainable pilots rather than to temporary prototypes or demonstrators.
These evolutions are expected to be supported by an open service platform which may have access to all in vehicle embedded information sources and to car surrounding information, in view of providing value-added apps e.g. intelligent maintenance. Key barriers to the deployment of such vehicles and ecosystems such as robustness of the perception, how to keep users of highly and fully automated vehicles sufficiently engaged and overall user acceptance are in scope, as well as economic, ethical, legal and regulatory issues.
Specific Pilot considerations:
Mapping of pilot architecture approaches with validated IoT reference architectures such as IoT-A enabling interoperability across use cases;
Common or interoperable object connectivity/functionality/intelligence approaches on various levels – protocols, data formats
Common or interoperable set of IoT related enablers and services. Pilots are requested to address the elements that provide the basis for interoperability with related fields outside the pilot especially for key aspects such as object identification/naming, service publication characteristics, search, semantic properties.
For the incorporation of users of the pilots, developers of additional applications, replication of the pilot through new sites or new connected devices, and complementary assessment of the acceptability of the use case where appropriate, the actions may involve financial support to third parties in line with the conditions set out in Part K of the General Annexes. Each consortium will define the selection process of the third parties for which financial support will be granted (typically in the order of EUR 100 000 to 300 000[5] per party). Up to 20% of the EU funding requested by the proposal may be allocated to the purpose of financial support to third parties[6].
Exchange on requirements for legal accompanying measures.
Involvement of social scientists and representative user groups, in order to design systems that are useful and acceptable for people/citizens and optimise testing and experimentation.
Integration of objects, devices and systems in an IoT environment adapted to the expressed needs of the users.
Pilots Implementation:
Pilots in the selected areas will clearly identify the supply and demand sides. The effort devoted to supply and demand should be balanced for each pilot.
The supply side represents the technological part of the pilot and addresses all the ICT elements that constitute the proposed approach. This includes:
definition of the IoT architecture;
IoT platform choice, technologies , necessary adaptations, trade offs required for the application requirements, and their management,
Retained platform deployment conditions, of non technological nature
development and operation of the distributed IoT nodes;
management and adaptation of involved sensing, actuating, processing, energy supply, storage technologies at node level (setting, programming, conditioning);
integration of devices, objects and systems in an IoT environment;
approaches to interoperability and openness;
security and privacy approaches;
contribution and compliance to relevant IoT standards;
The demand/user side of the pilot covers all the application and usage related elements. This includes:
definition, design, implementation and testing of multiple use-case scenarios;
setting up application(s) requirements in terms of performance, scale, reliability, cost, usability, maintenance;
interoperability needs and testing;
security and privacy needs;
feed-back to IoT supplier for technology optimisation;
users/citizen awareness, involvement and acceptance;
pro-active uptake of societal (RRI-SSH) issues;
impact, added value and affordability assessment;
mechanisms for replication;
business and sustainability models;
pilot conclusions and validation from the user side;
dissemination of results in relevant communities;
contribution and compliance to relevant IoT standards.
Pilot projects are expected to contribute to the consolidation and coherence work that will be implemented by the CSA supporting the activities defined under ""Horizontal Activities"" below. This requires that they contribute to clustering their results of horizontal nature (interoperability approach, standards, security and privacy approaches, business validation and sustainability, methodologies, metrics, etc.).
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU up to EUR 30 million (pilot 2), up to EUR 20 million (pilot 1), up to EUR 15 million (pilots 3, 4) and up to EUR 20 million (pilot 5) would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts. At least one large pilot is supported for each area.
Expected Impact:
Pilots are expected to have a high impact on citizens, both in the public and private spheres, industry, businesses and public services. Key performance indicators should be identified to measure progress on citizen benefits, economic growth, jobs creation, environment protection, productivity gains, etc.
Pilots' impact should go beyond involved partners and will aim at influencing external communities by putting in place appropriate mechanisms.
Validation of technological choices, sustainability and replicability, of architectures, standards, interoperability properties, of key characteristics such as security and privacy;
Exploration and validation of new industry and business processes and innovative business models validated in the context of the pilots.
User acceptance validation addressing privacy, security, vulnerability, liability, identification of user needs, concerns and expectations of the IoT solutions
Significant and measureable contribution to standards or pre-normative activities in the pilots' areas of action via the implementation of open platforms
Improvement of citizens' quality of life, in the public and private spheres, in terms of autonomy, convenience and comfort, participatory approaches, health and lifestyle, and access to services.
Creation of opportunities for entrepreneurs by promoting new market openings, providing access to valuable datasets and direct interactions with users, expanding local businesses to European scale, etc.
Development of secure and sustainable European IoT ecosystems and contribution to IoT infrastructures viable beyond the duration of the Pilot.
For Pilot 1:
Proposals should show clear evidence of the benefits of the proposed solutions for active and independent living and quality of life of older persons compared to current state of the art based on appropriate methodologies and metrics.

Specific challenge: Following the implementation of the actions foreseen by the Commission’s Communication on Joint Programming to tackle Europe’s major societal challenges, the Competitiveness Council has welcomed the progress made by EU Member States in Joint Programming Initiatives launched so far, among which is the Joint Programming Initiative ‘A Healthy Diet for a Healthy Life’ (JPI HDHL) that operates in the areas of food, nutrition, health, and physical activity research for the prevention of diet-related diseases. The vision of this JPI is that in 2030 all Europeans will have the motivation, ability and opportunity to consume a healthy diet from a variety of foods, have healthy levels of physical activity, and the incidence of diet-related diseases will have decreased significantly. Several Council Conclusions on Joint Programming[1] invite the Commission to support JPIs via Coordination and Support Actions. Scope: Proposals should build on the results expected by the coordination action in support to the HDHL JPI in the implementation of the Strategic Research Agenda (SRA) and Implementation Plan using effective and efficient methods of collaboration such as those proposed by the 'Voluntary guidelines on Framework Conditions, adopted by the High Level Group on Joint Programming. To carry out activities foreseen in the Implementation Plan, current efforts should be assessed to provide information on Member State implication and to favour the alignment of these activities to the JPI's SRA. Moreover, proposals should support in harmonization, integration, and alignment of national research programming, to enable evidence-based policy making and effective cross-policy actions, investigate novel forms of implementation of SRA such as collaborations with e.g. other JPIs or research infrastructures. Finally, they should further strengthen the international dimension of the JPI to be addressed by ensuring coherence with other relevant international initiatives. In line with the objectives of the EU strategy for international cooperation in research and innovation, proposals are encouraged to consider cooperation with related programmes from third countries.[2]The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU in the range of EUR 2 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately.

Specific challenge:Many barriers exist to practical implementation of RRI in research organizations. Therefore it is crucial to encourage the modernisation of institutional practices and culture in research institutions, Higher Education Institutions and funding agencies, to promote Responsible Research and Innovation. It also aims at supporting common actions by research institutions to identify and implement the best systemic organisational approaches to increase Responsible Research and Innovation uptake in research organizations.
Scope: This topic aims at developing a Responsible Research and Innovation Plan covering five RRI keys (societal engagement, gender equality and gender in research and innovation content, open access, science education and ethics) in each participating institution. The proposals shall include an analysis of the main problems and challenges, as well as a set of specific implementing actions aiming at the necessary structural change on the basis of specific situation and challenges. Action Plans shall be accompanied by an implementation roadmap. The RRI plans shall:
                Conduct impact assessment / audit of procedures and practices in order to identify RRI barriers at organisation level;
                Implement innovative strategies to address RRI barriers;

Specific challenge: Agriculture, forestry and the agri-food sector are integral parts of the European economy and society. They are subject to multiple pressures from external drivers, which include rising food, feed, fuel and fibre demand, globalisation, environmental changes and public health aspects, and are constrained by planetary boundaries such as land and water limits. With the expected increase in global population, demand for animal food products and competition for natural resources, agriculture and forestrywill need to become more efficient, and sustainable.
Scope: Proposals should address the following issues (F):
F. [2015] Biomarkers for nutrition and health
Development and validation of biomarkers for nutrition and health, including biomarkers for food intake and for the risk of diet-related disease.
The main objective of these ERA-NETs is to pool the necessary financial resources from the participating national (or regional) research programmes and the EU and to implement joint trans-national calls with EU co-funding in the above areas (one co-funded call per grant agreement, resulting in grants to third parties). Thematic focusing of these calls should be commensurate with the funds available, so as to ensure a reasonable rate of success in the call. The ERA-NETs should seek synergies with other relevant European and international research and innovation initiatives affecting sustainability and resilience of agriculture and food systems, in particular the FACCE and HDHL Joint Programming Initiatives. In line with the objectives of the EU strategy for international cooperation in research and innovation, proposals are encouraged to consider international cooperation, and the ERA-NETs should be open to participation by third countries national programmes[1].
The proposals should also aim at implementing other joint activities including additional joint calls without EU co-funding.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU in the range of EUR 5 million for (F) would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.

Specific challenge:Many barriers exist to practical implementation of RRI in research organizations. Therefore it is crucial to encourage the modernisation of institutional practices and culture in research institutions, Higher Education Institutions and funding agencies, to promote Responsible Research and Innovation. It also aims at supporting common actions by research institutions to identify and implement the best systemic organisational approaches to increase Responsible Research and Innovation uptake in research organizations.
Scope: This topic aims at developing a Responsible Research and Innovation Plan covering five RRI keys (societal engagement, gender equality and gender in research and innovation content, open access, science education and ethics) in each participating institution. The proposals shall include an analysis of the main problems and challenges, as well as a set of specific implementing actions aiming at the necessary structural change on the basis of specific situation and challenges. Action Plans shall be accompanied by an implementation roadmap. The RRI plans shall:
Conduct impact assessment / audit of procedures and practices in order to identify RRI barriers at organisation level;
Implement innovative strategies to address RRI barriers;
Develop the RRI dimension in research content and programmes;
Set targets and monitor progress via indicators at organisation level.
The proposals shall include a methodology for impartially monitoring and assessing the progress made throughout the duration of the project. This activity could be dedicated to a specific partner organisation or subcontracted.
The proposals should include an international dimension in particular with the following countries: Brazil, Republic of South Africa, India, Canada, Australia, Russia, United States of America, Japan and China.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 2 and 4 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected impact: Activities shall produce tangible and measurable results in terms of organisational process and structures. They will improve the uptake of Responsible Research and Innovation in research organisations, as the Plans will continue to be implemented in the medium / long term. In the medium term, institutional change shall be scalable to research institutions across EU 28 and Associated countries, thus contributing towards European Research Area (ERA) objectives. In the long term, the action will increase research institutions' ability to generate innovation that reflects societal needs.
Type of action: Coordination and Support Actions."

As climatic changes increasingly place populations under pressure, human beings are already adapting. However, less developed countries – particularly in Africa – are often less resilient to climate change and require the deployment of appropriate support to adaptation, including in the form of bespoke climate services tailored to users' needs. There is some evidence that climate change may already be playing a role in shaping population migration patterns around the world (e.g. Africa to Europe). It is important to make use of the wealth of available socio-economic and geophysical data to better understand these patterns in order to develop appropriate policy responses.
Scope:
Actions should address only one of the following sub-topics:
a) Climate services for Africa: Actions should exploit new, relevant climate data made available by Copernicus and other relevant sources (such as GEOSS) and create dedicated climate services for Africa for at least two of the following sectors: water, energy, food security, land use[1], health and infrastructure. Actions should develop and deliver tools/applications which demonstrate clear end-user engagement, consultation and participation, and which enhance planning and implementation of climate adaptation strategies in Africa. Actions should consider activities addressed by other initiatives such as the Global Framework for Climate Services (GFCS), Copernicus, and development cooperation activities, and provide added value. Actions should further consider the EU-Africa Research and Innovation Partnership on Climate Change and Sustainable Energy[2].
b) Climate and human migration: Actions should identify and analyse drivers relating to climate change that may affect human migration and displacement patterns. Actions should – using a multidisciplinary approach – identify and describe climate parameters, develop analytical methodologies, and demonstrate how these relate to human migration patterns, including the probability of migration/forced displacement and design adaptation solutions that may help in alleviating migration pressures at the source. They should also provide guidelines and policy recommendations for the European Agenda on Migration. Actions may also harness local knowledge and information by engaging with civil society organisations and citizen groups.
For both of the sub-topics, in line with the strategy for EU international cooperation in research and innovation (COM(2012)497), international cooperation is encouraged[3].
The participation of social sciences and humanities disciplines is encouraged to address the complex challenges of this topic, including challenges associated with relevant gender issues.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 5 million and EUR 7 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.

","04 September 2019","Specific Challenge:
The Paris Agreement notes the importance of taking action to ensure the integrity of all ecosystems and the protection of biodiversity in the context of combatting climate change and adapting to its impacts. An improved understanding of the interactions and feedbacks between ecological processes and climate change, together with evidence-based guidance, is crucial for the development of appropriate solution-oriented strategies and measures for biodiversity conservation and cost-effective ecosystems-based climate change adaptation and mitigation. Furthermore, there are opportunities to let biodiversity and ecosystems benefit multidimensionally from climate change adaptation and mitigation, because intelligent climate policy can simultaneously reduce other environmental stresses, such as air pollution.
Scope:
Actions should investigate at all relevant spatial and temporal scales the way that ecological processes, biodiversity (including terrestrial and/or marine ecosystems as appropriate) and ecosystem services are impacted, both directly and indirectly, by climate change. Actions should consider the interactions and feedbacks between climate change and biodiversity, ecosystem functions and services. The vulnerability of biodiversity and ecosystems functions and services to climate change should be investigated and modelled across a range of European (including other European territories) climatic and ecological regions; this includes human activities with relevance to climate change. They should account for social, ecological and economic aspects and climate change relevant stressors and sources of uncertainty. These should include tipping points and safe operating spaces. The role of nature-based solutions[1]in enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of climate change adaptation and mitigation strategies should be assessed and synergies with other pollution-reducing environmental policies be explored. Work should build, as appropriate, on existing knowledge and activities such as relevant FP7/Horizon 2020 and LIFE projects, European climate adaptation platforms and Copernicus Services, in particular on climate change, land monitoring and marine environmental monitoring, and contribute to long-term monitoring initiatives.
Actions should envisage clustering activities with other relevant selected projects for cross-projects co-operation, consultations and joint activities on cross-cutting issues and share of results as well as participating in joint meetings and communication events. To this end, proposals should foresee a dedicated work package and/or task, and earmark the appropriate resources accordingly.
In line with the strategy for EU international cooperation in research and innovation (COM(2012)497), international cooperation is encouraged, in particular with CELAC[2] countries.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU in the range of EUR 5 million to 7 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
The project results are expected to contribute to:
more effective, integrated and evidence-based biodiversity conservation strategies and ecosystem management in the face of climate change;
pushing the EU to the forefront in climate-change predictive capacity through models better accounting for the interactions and feedbacks between biodiversity, ecosystems and the climate system;
more effective ecosystem-based adaptation and mitigation, through evidence-based design and implementation of systemic nature-based solutions ;
enhanced ecosystem integrity, functionality, resilience and delivery of services;
increased investment in nature-based solutions, and ecosystem conservation, restoration and management, to support climate change adaptation and mitigation strategies;
providing evidence on the impacts of biodiversity on climate mitigation and adaptation, including indicators/quantitative data;
underpinning the EU Nature Directives, EU Biodiversity Strategy, 7th Environment Action Programme, and the EU Strategy on adaptation to climate change;
informing major international scientific assessments such as the IPCC reports and the IPBES;

","04 September 2019","Specific Challenge:
Globally, glaciers and the large ice sheets of Antarctica and Greenland are particularly vulnerable to climate change, risking a significant future contribution to changes in sea levels. At present, there are significant uncertainties, e.g. relating to their stability, which prevent an accurate assessment of their vulnerability. The 'Arctic amplification' of global warming is putting pressure on the ecosystems and communities of the region and having an impact at global level as well. The Arctic's fragile natural ecosystems and societies are under serious threat, and additional human activities, linked to the new economic opportunities that are made possible by climate change, are putting additional pressure on them.
Scope:
Actions should aim at developing innovative approaches to address only one of the following sub-topics:
a) Sea-level changes (Research and Innovation action): Actions should assess the processes controlling changes to global ice mass balance - including ice dynamics - such as ice shelf-ocean and sea-ice interactions, surface components, effects of crustal de-loading (Glacial Isostatic Adjustments) on relative sea-level changes and/or gravitational effects of ice mass changes on the spatial patterns of sea-level changes. Actions should assess the status of ice sheets and glaciers, report on how their changes are likely to affect future sea-levels, and increase confidence in predicting changes in the cryosphere including through better representation of poorly represented processes. Actions should also analyse low-probability high-impact scenarios including those associated with the collapse of ice sheets (sea-level fingerprints). Actions may be focused on specific issues which substantially contribute to sea-level changes and to the assessment of the associated major risks to and impacts on coastal communities, coastal ecosystems and critical infrastructure across the globe. Clustering with relevant projects funded by the ESA Earth Observation Programme is encouraged.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU in the range of EUR 8 to EUR 10 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
b) Changes in Arctic biodiversity (Research and Innovation action): Actions should identify and analyse major drivers and implications of changing biodiversity in the Arctic, such as the role of invasive species, and how vulnerable land and/or marine ecosystems are with respect to combined human and natural influences. Actions should assess the ecosystems' responses to both external and internal factors and how these responses are impacting on indigenous populations and local communities at socio-economic level. Actions should also identify adaptation strategies in relation to the changes in Arctic ecosystems.
The participation of social sciences and humanities disciplines is important for addressing the complex challenges of this topic.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU in the range of EUR 5 to EUR 6 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
c) Sustainable opportunities in a changing Arctic (Research and Innovation action): Actions should assess the viability of new economic activities – such as resource exploitation, shipping and tourism – and their ecological and socio-economic impacts and feedbacks at various scales, and their impact on the provision of ecosystem services. Actions should investigate key processes with high societal and economic impacts and provide appropriate, solution-oriented adaptation and mitigation responses, as well as capacity building for sustainable livelihoods while considering – in a co-design approach – the needs, priorities and perspectives of indigenous populations, local communities and economic actors operating in the region.
The participation of social sciences and humanities disciplines is essential for addressing the complex challenges of this topic.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU in the range of EUR 5 to EUR 6 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
d) Arctic standards (Coordination and Support action): The action should propose guidelines and protocols to develop ‘Arctic standards’, also including the legal framework, based on the translation of research outcomes into cold-climate technologies and services with commercial potential and the assessment of the sustainability of associated processes and technologies. The action should cover a wide range of technologies and services that have the potential to bring broad social and economic benefits within and beyond the Arctic region. The action should also provide requirements on how to design, build, install, and operate equipment and services to safely perform activities in the Arctic and to respond to emergencies.
The participation of standardisation organisations is encouraged.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU in the range of EUR 2 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
For all of the above sub-topics, in line with the strategy for EU international cooperation in research and innovation (COM(2012)497), international cooperation is encouraged[1], in particular with countries – beyond the EU Member States and countries associated to Horizon 2020 – that took part in the first Arctic Science Ministerial of 28 September 2016[2].
Expected Impact:
For projects addressing parts a), b) or c), the project results are expected to contribute to:
the implementation of the new integrated EU policy for the Arctic[3];
the IPCC assessments and other major regional and global initiatives;
enhanced engagement of and the interaction with residents from local communities and indigenous societies.
support the EU Arctic Research Cluster[4]
For projects addressing part d), the project results are expected to contribute to:
enhanced stakeholder capability to operate in cold climate environments;
better servicing of the economic sectors that operate in the Arctic (e.g. shipping, tourism);
promoting sustainable Arctic opportunities arising from climate change and supporting the leverage of regional (EU) funds into these opportunities;
supporting the competitiveness of European industry, particularly SMEs, engaging in sustainable development of the Arctic.

","03 September 2020","Specific Challenge:
The early 2020s will be an important period for EU climate action. In the context of the Paris Agreement, all Parties including the EU were invited to submit by 2020 both an update of the Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) regarding short term actions up to 2030 as well as long-term greenhouse gas emission development strategies up to 2050. These strategies are expected to underpin the EU’s commitment to the Paris Agreement to limit global warming to well below 2°C and to pursue efforts to keep it below 1.5°C. They will also address the need to reach carbon neutrality by mid-century, as highlighted by the recent IPCC Special Report on 1.5°C. Achieving the Paris climate goals and EU commitments will also depend on individuals, households and communities, who should systematically choose low-carbon options in their daily consumption, lifestyle and investment decisions. Effective communication on climate change and demand-side measures will be instrumental for active engagement of citizens. A reliable policy framework is needed for business and consumers enabling low-carbon consumption, lifestyle and investment decisions. Furthermore, the EU does not act in isolation and cannot achieve the Paris Agreement goals by its own mitigation efforts. Also other countries will be preparing for their next steps related to the development of new NDCs. Achieving the goals of the Paris Agreement will require a very significant increase of ambition and swift implementation at the global scale. Actions under this topic should provide scientific evidence, analysis and support for these processes and reinforce the link between the latest climate science, mitigation pathways and underlying policies.
Scope:
Actions should address only one of the following sub-topics:
a) Assessing and designing climate policies for the coming decade:
Actions should analyse what contributed to the delivery on the 2020 energy and climate policy targets, based on available European and national data and outcomes, with special regard to, inter alia, policy implementation, low-carbon investment flows, industrial innovation, the energy- land-use nexus, economic and environmental impact, and technology development and diffusion, as well as consequences for the post-2020 period. In the context of the EU's 2030 energy and climate targets and in view of providing scientific support to the design of post-2030 climate policies, actions should also analyse the needed evolution of the mitigation, adaptation and innovation policy mix at all relevant scales, including their innovative financing, the associated macro-economic and sector-level impact, including on productivity, competitiveness, environment, health and employment; the required investment flows for zero carbon solutions; the relevant socio-technical transition processes, as well as the interaction between near- to mid-term action, and long-term mitigation pathways. Finally, actions should involve relevant (private and public) stakeholders to enhance further their policy-relevance.
b) Decarbonisation and lifestyle changes:
Citizen engagement in climate action will be indispensable for delivering on the Paris Agreement goals, therefore identifying critical areas of individual level action, relevant structural changes and means to incentivise them are key. Accordingly, actions should identify and analyse the role of individuals (including gender aspects), households and communities in the socio-technical transition, critical areas of lifestyle change, and associated social innovation processes that are needed globally and in Europe to be in phase with low-carbon emission pathways. The analysis should consider, inter alia, the economic and climate impact of shifting lifestyle and consumption patterns, and the health co-benefits of action, as well as the risks of unintended consequences (e.g. rebound effects). Actions should also explore how citizen and household level changes can be incentivised and analyse enablers for and barriers to public engagement and acceptance. Actions may also explore possible policies and communication strategies on climate action where appropriate in conjunction with health co-benefits in order to engage citizens and stakeholders from relevant economic sectors and develop concrete recommendations. Already existing low-carbon lifestyles within intentional communities like eco villages, transition towns, slow food, slow city movements or car-free living maybe investigated in terms of what hampers their action despite high motivation and what can be learned for up-scaling or duplicating low-carbon practices. Finally, actions may explore citizen science activities as a way to engage and educate citizens on climate action.
c) Science underpinning the preparations of NDCs after the 2023 Global Stocktake at a global scale:
Following the 2018 Talanoa Dialogue which examined countries collective progress in global climate action, the next milestones of global climate governance will be the 2023 Global Stocktake and the preparation of new NDCs for the period beyond 2030, which for most countries have to be submitted by 2025. The need for adequate scientific capacities at national and subnational levels – and going beyond major economies – remains considerable. Actions should provide state-of-the-art evidence to policymakers during this crucial time. In particular, they should: contribute to the evidence base supporting countries efforts to finalise NDCs in 2024 following the Global Stocktake at the end of 2023 by i) reviewing the process of the development of existing NDCs including if and how policies were implemented by 2023 to achieve these NDCs, ii) providing scientific information on the options available for preparing post-2030 NDCs compatible with the goals of the Paris Agreement (mid- and long-term action) and latest climate science, within the context of multiple economic and sustainable development priorities and iii) demonstrating through quantitative modelling techniques how scientific findings such as those assessed in the IPCC can be translated into viable policies and long-term decarbonisation pathways at regional and national levels. Furthermore, actions should provide insights concerning the risks related to stranded assets, as well as possible interactions with policies targeting the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals. Actions should also assess to what extent, next to national action in the context of NDCs, international bunker fuels can contribute to achieve the Paris Agreement's mitigation goals, and what the risks are for double counting efforts between sectors.
Proposals for all sub-topics are encouraged to extend their analysis to some major emitters outside Europe and to selected less-developed countries.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU in the range of EUR 3-5 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
The project results are expected to contribute to:
providing measurable support to the EU's long term strategy on greenhouse gas emission reductions;
providing national and global pathways towards the Paris Agreement’s global temperature goal and insights into how these can inform countries’ next NDCs.
supporting the Stocktake Exercise by taking stock of collective progress towards the Paris Agreement goals and investigating how progress can be accelerated;
demonstrating how the latest climate science (including the 6th Assessment Report of the IPCC) can be converted into practical advice for national mitigation action;

","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
The urgency and the scale of Green Deal challenges require the mobilisation and advancement of world-class scientific capacities and resources such as those offered by European Research Infrastructures. They will contribute to the transition towards a climate neutral Europe, targeting at least 50% emissions reduction by 2030. As a pilot under Horizon 2020, activities will focus on the provision of research and innovation services for breakthrough research in two priority areas: energy storage and advanced climate/environment observation and monitoring. Expected impacts range from answering short-term needs of thematic European Green Deal objectives to longer-term perspective including Horizon Europe.
Energy storage:
In order to boost the advancement of knowledge and technology in the field of energy storage, European researchers need effective and customised access to the best research infrastructures. The aim of this action is to bring together, integrate on European scale, and open up key national and regional research infrastructures to European researchers from both academia and industry, as well as to develop any missing services, which better fit specific needs for research and technological developments.
Advanced climate/environment observation:
European research infrastructures such as ICOS, ACTRIS and IAGOS[1] are key enablers of the knowledge necessary to conceive, develop and assess European policies to address climate change and air pollution. They are essential to observe, understand and predict complex processes of the atmosphere, the concentration and flux of (long-lived) greenhouse gases, the interaction of short-lived atmospheric constituents and air pollutants. They provide sustained long-term, high quality and interoperable data, also used to calibrate satellites, validate or constrain climate models, weather forecasts, air pollution forecasts etc.
Yet, these research infrastructures do not cover appropriately “hotspots” such as cities and industry intensive sites (frequently not far from cities) despite their major role: cities and their surrounding are strong emitters of greenhouse gases and air pollutants; due to the high density of population, the impact on citizens’ health is very high. In particular, in situ measurements in and around cities to quantify anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases[2] and nanoparticles (with still unknown potential health damage) are lacking.
Scope:
Proposals will address one of the following sub-topics:
(a) Support Europe leadership in clean energy storage technologies
This sub-topic aims at:
supporting the development of a world-class European research and industrial ecosystem underpinning energy storage activities and the related value-chain;
enhancing the competitiveness of current and emerging industries by providing easy and seamless access to the most advanced scientific infrastructure available in Europe and related services;
enabling breakthrough research and innovation in energy storage systems and related materials across the whole value chain and with a life-cycle approach;
supporting a fair transition towards climate neutrality through a better understanding of socio-economic issues underpinning a paradigm change and of how to foster climate-neutral social practices.
Activities will cover the coordinated and integrated provision of transnational and virtual access by wide communities of key research infrastructures as well as joint developments of specific services to facilitate and integrate the access procedures, to improve and customise the services the infrastructures provide, and to further develop on-line and testing services. User training may be supported, to maximise the benefits and to ensure the optimal use of the services provided.
This action brings together several complementary and interdisciplinary facilities relevant for energy storage research and innovation, addressing different TRLs and covering the whole value chain in view of possible industrial applications. They will provide transnational and virtual access to technically advanced instrumentation and scientific methods in a coordinated and user-friendly way as well as training for their use and services linked to material modelling, data mining and experiment design.
Activities will also contribute to address the objectives of the European initiatives to tackle critical issues relating to performance, reliability and safety of storage technologies and to support strategies addressing the whole life-cycle.
Proposals should clearly identify potential industrial users and research communities, which can benefit from this pan-European open access to services and advanced instrumentations offered by internationally renowned facilities and strengthen the cooperation among researchers and industrial users.
Proposals are expected to duly take into account all relevant ESFRI and/or ERICs and other world-class research infrastructures as well as relevant major European initiatives, such as the Open Innovation Test Beds, to exploit synergies.
Proposals will also have to highlight how they contribute to attract new talents and create expertise support new skills through training addressing researchers and industrial users.
Trans-national and virtual access provision shall follow the rules specified for integrating activities under point (ii) “Trans-national and/or virtual access activities” in part D of the section “Specific features for Research Infrastructures”. Compliance with these provisions will be taken into account during evaluation.
Proposals should adopt the guidelines and principles of the European Charter for Access to Research Infrastructures. They should define a data management plan, even when they opt out of the extended Pilot on Open Research Data. When they address the curation, preservation and provision of access to the data collected or produced under the project, proposals should build upon the state of the art in ICT and e-infrastructures for data, computing and networking, and ensure connection to the European Open Science Cloud.
In line with the strategy for EU international cooperation in research and innovation (COM(2012)497), proposals should, whenever appropriate, pay due attention to any related international initiative (i.e. outside the EU) and foster the development of global standards.
Proposals should include clear indicators allowing the assessment of the progress towards the general and specific objectives, other than the access provision.
As the scope of this topic is to ensure integration and access to key European infrastructures in this domain and to avoid duplication of effort, at most one proposal is expected to be submitted.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of up to EUR 7 million would allow this topic to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
(b) Enhancing European research infrastructures for greenhouse gases observation in and around cities
The action should enhance greenhouse gases observation capacity of European research infrastructures, notably anthropogenic CO2 emissions, in and around cities and other large emissions sites such as industrial sites, transport infrastructures.
The action should include:
Scientific and technical work, i.e. (1) the drafting of concepts, architecture and engineering plans for extending and upgrading existing European research infrastructures and, when relevant, the creation of instrumentation prototypes or testbeds for up-to-date instrument arrays; (2) plans for the efficient curation, preservation and provision of access to their data in line with FAIR principles;
Conceptual work i.e. (1) plans to integrate the new capacities into the existing European research infrastructures and related governance; (2) estimated budget for upgrade and operation and outlines of long-term funding plans;
Pilot implementation in at least one representative urban site, showing the engagement of national/local authorities and demonstrating the ability to integrate complementary measurements systems and methods as well as data. When applicable, the action should consider solutions relevant to air quality assessment e.g. measurement of co-emitted species from fossil fuel burning. It should address quality control, traceability of measurements and standards. It should include the development of core data services upgrading the current services offered by the European research infrastructures. The action should address the selection criteria and process for selecting the pilot implementation site(s).
Roadmap for upscaling:
The action should propose a flexible design with generic core elements and complementary observations depending on the specific nature of sites. The action should seek, at all stages, synergies and interoperability among European research infrastructures and with air quality monitoring networks as well as coordination with European observational programmes and initiatives[3]. In particular:
The action should propose strategies to engage stakeholders, including citizens, to build commitment at local, national and European level and promote long-term sustainability.
The action should engage in networking and training and promote interoperability, dissemination and exchange of experience and practices.
The action should propose appropriate framework to coordinate with or contribute to key relevant European initiatives such as Copernicus, EOSC, and support global initiatives such as the Paris Agreement, 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development Goals, IPCC. It should also ensure relevance to the Mission on Climate Neutral Cities by 2030.
The action should propose possible roadmaps for upscaling and replicating the solutions for enhancing the European research infrastructures.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of up to EUR 13 million would allow this topic to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
(c) Enhancing observations for air quality and citizens’ health in urban areas
The action should enhance urban air quality monitoring networks and other relevant observing infrastructures in measuring air pollutants such as particles and their precursors (both in mass and particles number concentrations, including specific nanoparticles data at traffic and airport sites). Engagement of the health community and citizens is required to address the scarce availability of sub 100nm particles concentration data, which has hampered epidemiological studies on their effects.
The action should include:
Scientific and technical work to upgrade air quality monitoring networks ensuring measurement of maximum exposure to nanoparticles and efficient curation, preservation and provision of access to data in line with FAIR principles;
Pilot implementation in at least two representative sites, showing the engagement of national/local authorities and demonstrating the ability to integrate complementary measurements systems and methods as well as data. It should address quality control, traceability of measurements and standards. In particular, it should develop interoperable solutions and ensure measurements between cities are comparable. It should test innovative solutions such as mobile instrumentation and build on citizens’ observatories initiatives. The action should address the selection criteria and process for selecting the pilot implementation sites.
Roadmap for upscaling:
The action should explore, at all stages, synergies and interoperability with European research infrastructures, among air quality monitoring networks and, when relevant, satellite-based observations. The action should propose the optimal design of well-coordinated, inter-operable, large city scale networks building on existing European research infrastructures and city air quality monitoring networks. In particular:
The action should propose strategies to engage stakeholders, including citizens, to build commitment at local, national and European level and promote long-term sustainability.
The action should engage in networking and training and promote interoperability, dissemination and exchange of experience and practices.
The action should propose appropriate framework to coordinate with or contribute to key relevant European initiatives such as Copernicus, EOSC, and support global initiatives such as the Paris Agreement, 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development Goals. It should also ensure relevance to the Mission on Climate Neutral Cities by 2030.
The action should propose possible roadmaps for upscaling and replicating the solutions for enhancing the European research infrastructures and city air quality monitoring networks.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of up to EUR 8 million would allow this topic to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
The development of synergies among research infrastructures in different disciplinary areas, including social sciences, and improved, optimised and harmonised research services to address Green Deal objectives will foster economies of scale and improved use of scientific resources across Europe and beyond.
Users, both from the scientific and industrial community, will benefit from integrated and efficient access to the best research infrastructures as well as from advanced research services addressing their specific needs.
RIs will foster the development of new skills and a new generation of researchers ready to optimally exploit the most advanced and essential instruments and resources for research and innovation addressing Green Deal challenges.

(b) Enhancing European research infrastructures for greenhouse gases observation in and around cities and (c) Enhancing observations for air quality and citizens’ health in urban areas
These activities will:
enable the development of evidence-based sustainability strategies, taking also account of impacts on health, through the provision of interoperable data, tools/equipment and models needed by the scientific community and public authorities/decision makers;
trigger the decision making process leading to the upgrade of existing infrastructure;.
develop synergies and complementary capabilities between Research infrastructures and monitoring networks, thus promoting economies of scale and improved use of resources across Europe through the common development and optimisation of operations as well as interoperability of data and data streams;

","Innovation action
","04 December 2018
","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
The market share of full electric vehicles is still low in many European member states. Several reasons have been identified for this. Charging infrastructure is considered as one of the central reasons when the urban model does not allow for widespread garage availability, or when frequent long range travel is involved. Currently most EV owners have their own garage and live in peri-urban areas.
Innovative solutions need to be evaluated and developed to allow EV drivers to have a similar or even better mobility experience than with conventional fossil fuel vehicles in terms of availability, convenience, performance and costs of the necessary charging infrastructure. At the same time, the infrastructure should not affect the noise environment around them, in order not to create resistance to their installation in urban contexts.
In the longer term, electric roads can be considered for further streamlining the user experience starting from urban and peri-urban applications such as bus, taxi and LDV lanes, for later extension to extra-urban applications.
The challenge will be to support the accelerated deployment of recharging infrastructure, on the one hand a slow charging infrastructure for cities with low garage availability, on the other hand ultrafast occasional charging infrastructure for long range travel. The responsible stakeholders need to be incentivized to take clear steps for a wide availability of charging points and to improve the conditions for a broad market acceptance in the electrification of transport.
Scope:
Proposals will have to address all following technical areas including demonstration of the final solutions and their interoperability in multiple cities and TEN-T transnational road links:
Analysis of subjective perception of charging options and identification of decision influences and concerns of users. The results should provide the basis for strategies or solutions to encourage or incentivize users of different social groups to overcome acceptance barriers in order to accelerate widespread usage of EVs.
Attractive and convenient charging infrastructure access with connected vehicle systems avoiding waiting times (through for instance, charging facility reservation and scheduling, integration with route planning of multiple vehicles). User preferences like use of renewable energy and avoidance of frequent handling of heavy cables have to be considered. Automated conductive or wireless solutions are expected with highly reliable and interoperable devices. Test methods need to be further optimized, for instance to assess interoperability. Optionally, further extension of the developed stationary wireless charging technology towards urban and periurban ""electric road"" applications, with the aim of creating an installed base of wireless-ready vehicles to provide the critical mass needed for the deployment of electrified roads at a later stage.
Transparent, flexible and interconnected payment systems for maximum availability of the charging infrastructure also for drivers who do not regularly use the same car (company/family sharing, commercial car sharing, rental cars, …) or travel across Europe.
User survey about parking habits, considering for instance how much time is spent at a given location; what type of services are needed or expected during charging; how should the future charging station look like.
Improvement of the currently deployed or planned superfast charging systems according to the previous survey to convince all car owners of the advantages of electric mobility including a sufficient convenience for long trips. All technical possibilities for optimization, both on the vehicle (like temperature preconditioning), or for energy demand rationalisation (e.g. local renewable power support for solar panels, battery storage for peak shaving and other grid services, demand control by interconnected route management systems for incoming vehicles while taking into account the electricity grid availability and voltage and frequency control constraints in real-time) need to be taken into account.
Scalable charging infrastructure for ramp-up of expected electric mobility needs in terms of power levels and number of charging posts at one site, adequately managing the impact on the grid.
Cheap low power DC-Charging for highly efficient connection to future home and office energy systems based on DC-Networks with possibility of V2G by smartening the link between vehicle, charging infrastructure and the grid.
Low power DC-charging for LEV’s in combination with theft-proof parking for two-wheelers.
Analysis of market models, regulatory and harmonization recommendations to foster the deployment of EV charging infrastructure in all member states of the EU. Slow charging in public or private parking garages shall be enabled by standardized demand management to remove barriers of electricity installations in existing apartment blocks and garages considering smart grid implications.
Development of planning methods to optimize the location of charging sites, taking in consideration user needs and habits (volume of EVs in the area, type of mobility needs, accessibility to charging points, traffic volume, …) as well as time and costs associated to the availability and reinforcement of the necessary electricity network with easy scalability according to the different stages of EV penetration. Analysis and cost effective solutions for specific cases like availability of infrastructure in isolated mountain or seaside locations, or for special events, where high peak demand is associated with short periods of use. Consideration for local storage benefits in the different cases studied.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU between EUR 8 and 15 million depending on the level of involved demonstration would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
Wide user acceptance beyond early adopters, urban users and garage parkers;
Foster investors to invest in charging infrastructure;
Determine legal gaps which slow down infrastructure expansion and propose solutions;
Improve interoperability of vehicle-to-charger and charger-to-infrastructure communication;
Better grid integration of high-power chargers;
Standardized charging solutions and payment systems for LEVs for price reduction and higher market acceptance in urban environments.

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Underpinned by knowledge in the latest IPCC and IPBES reports, large-scale ecosystem restoration is urgent – the window of opportunity is closing rapidly. It needs a systemic approach to deliver tangible benefits on the European Green Deal actions for climate (mitigation, adaptation and disaster risk reduction), biodiversity, zero pollution and sustainable food systems (from farm to fork), health and wellbeing. Actions under this topic should therefore be pivotal in demonstrating and promoting systemic solutions for upscaling urgent restoration to increase biodiversity and support a wide range of ecosystem services, as requested in the Biodiversity Strategy for 2030 for damaged terrestrial, freshwater, coastal and marine ecosystems.
Resilient, healthy ecosystems are natural carbon stocks and sinks. They can remove CO2 from the atmosphere and support adaptation to climate change and disaster risk reduction. In addition to delivering a wide range of other services (oxygen source, improved health and well-being, recreation, water retention and purification, air quality, nutrient cycling or pollination), ecosystems are essential in a wide range of sectors which impact the everyday life of Europe’s citizens (food, feed, fibre or fuel provision across the bioeconomy). However, biodiversity is being lost and ecosystems are degrading at an alarming rate. Pressures on biodiversity are increasing at a faster rate than the efforts to protect it[1]. The integrity of terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems, and their capacity to deliver a wide range of essential services to people, will be further undermined by the effects of unavoidable climate change. There is therefore a need to strengthen their resilience against environmental and climate stressors while integrating the local socio-economic specificities of their surrounding environment.
While solutions for the restoration of biodiversity and ecosystem services are available now, they are neither up-scaled nor integrated enough in today’s governance, investment or policy support landscapes. Research and demonstration on how to scale up technical and non-technical approaches for the spatial and social-economic integration of restoration impacts is therefore needed. The environmental emergency highlights the limits of current management approaches and calls for investment in innovative, sustainable and effective restoration including through mobilising innovative funding and cross-sectoral collaborations that could trigger transformational change. Moreover, the global biodiversity post-2020 framework seeks voluntary commitments by business and stakeholders to invest in biodiversity and new approaches to speed up actions in the framework of the UN decade for restoration.
From increased social awareness to more engagement with the private sector, there is a distinct need to build trans-disciplinary collaborations at all scales and across relevant ecosystem types. Win-win solutions and multi-purpose usage that support local biodiversity while delivering specific services and socio-economic benefits are sought. Hence, this topic seeks answers on how to frame transformational change which supports a just transition[2] – to show how investing in nature restoration can explicitly help vulnerable regions and communities to improve their resilience to social and environmental shocks, when rapid changes in climate and environment, economies and social conditions occur.
This topic therefore responds to the urgent double challenge of (i) accelerating transformative change through (ii) upscaling restoration of ecosystems at sea or on land.
Scope:
Actions should:
provide large-scale demonstrators of how systemic upscaling and replication of best practice ecosystem restoration[3] can be deployed at regional, national and cross-border levels, focusing on degraded terrestrial, freshwater, coastal or marine ecosystems, responding to relevant restoration goals enhancing biodiversity;
in line with the EU Biodiversity Strategy for 2030, restore degraded ecosystems, in particular those with high potential to capture and store carbon and to prevent and reduce the impact of natural disasters, and, where relevant, to contribute to the achievement of favourable status for species and habitats of the Birds and Habitats Directives inside and outside the Natura 2000 network of protected areas;
adapt, integrate and demonstrate innovative methods (technological, non-technological, social and governance, including sustainable financing) on upscaling ecosystem restoration, also in regions and for communities in transition;
support the development of specific demand and supply chains in restoring ecosystems on land or at sea – recognising that conditions at sea can considerably differ from the ones on land (including freshwater), that speed of change and disturbance might differ, and that solutions to reverse biodiversity decline are context-specific;
demonstrate and test how restoration activities and socio-ecological management of ecosystems enable sustainable, climate-neutral and climate-resilient, inclusive, transformative approaches, including across the bioeconomy (agriculture, forestry, marine and innovative bio-based sectors) and as investments in disaster risk reduction;
promote scaling up and stepping up of implementation of nature-based solutions[4] building on existing experience in particular on lessons learned and best practices gained through EU-funded projects and initiatives such as those supported by Horizon 2020 and the LIFE programme[5] in order to address barriers to implementation for systemic nature-based solutions focussing on restoration in urban, peri-urban, rural or marine areas;
showcase how restoring ecosystems at large scale will also help human communities to adapt to changing conditions at their local level, and how restoration activities can be integrated into economically and socially viable land use practices, enabling a shift of social and behavioural patterns towards increased benefits for biodiversity and strengthening social acceptance and social resilience;
demonstrate how to maximise synergies and avoid trade-offs between priorities for restoring biodiversity, mitigating and adapting to climate change (such as those identified jointly by the IPCC and IPBES).
generate knowledge on how large-scale restoration can accelerate transformative change beneficial for biodiversity and climate resilience, and bring this information to UN programmes, as well as to IPCC and IPBES[6], processes.
Actions should demonstrate how restoration (in biodiversity richness and abundance, structure, function and connectivity) of ecosystems and their services can be scaled up[7], in collaboration with stakeholders, so that opportunities for substantial biodiversity and ecosystem services gains will be realised, which in turn deliver social and economic benefits. This pilot is a European Green Deal enabler and can be used as a testbed for further green infrastructure/nature-based solution investment by the European Investment Bank (EIB), for LIFE SNAPs[8], and relevant further budget lines in the next Multiannual Financial Framework.
Appropriate budget for cooperation with and use of tools resulting from previous projects on ecosystem restoration and nature-based solutions[9], including from LIFE projects[10] and with Horizon Europe activities such as the European Partnerships[11] and Missions[12] should be envisaged.
Actions should also test and evaluate innovating approaches for creating value with human communities undergoing transformative change, avoiding negative externalities and improving their living conditions by restoring their terrestrial and/or aquatic environment.
Actions should also address all of the following issues:
Together with the concerned communities, developing a scalability plan, including at landscape scale and using spatial planning legislation where relevant. The scalability plan should include diffusion of innovative solutions, and a process for commitments in adopting large-scale restoration within governance and financing systems, so other relevant communities can replicate the upscaling across the EU and internationally. It should seek guarantees for the non-reversibility and/or continuity of up-scaled restoration activities and/or further replication and/or expansion, implementation of sustainable management practices and monitoring after the end of the projects.
Setting baselines, goals and a monitoring framework for the projects: why an activity is being undertaken, what changes are expected and by when, and how changes are monitored in order to determine if the action was successful in relation to the original goals. Activities should be prioritised according to their urgency for addressing upscaling restoration challenges, the restoration potential of degraded ecosystems, the significance of research for supporting EU policy needs, their contribution to the international biodiversity agenda, and their potential to trigger transformative change.
Restoration actions should be paired with supportive and robust management practices that reduce pressures and direct habitat damage at the local scale, and empower civil society in planning and deployment of restoration and maintenance of its achievements to support restoration efforts in the long term.
Prioritisation should be informed by social, economic and ecological conditions and recovery efficiency to ensure restoration efforts are resilient and efficient. Approaches should be based on existing knowledge from prior research or experience and tested restoration methods [13] and should seek complementarity with LIFE projects [14]. To increase the scale, scope and pace of restoration, efforts should be based on evidence, better understanding and communication of ecosystem service recovery and thresholds for effective ecosystem restoration, and the inclusive involvement of social and economic actors.
Activities related to improving ecosystem condition should be integrated into best practice monitoring activities within respective monitoring governance schemes[15]. No new restoration monitoring approaches should be developed. Actions should explicitly include deliverables which apply (or test, if necessary) monitoring schemes with efficiency and output indicators related to restoration, its benefits and trade-offs.
Actions should promote innovative funding, cross-sectoral collaborations and social participation to support the design, implementation and monitoring of sustainable and effective restoration efforts. They should explore how upscaling and mainstreaming of ecosystem restoration could facilitate systemic transformation in governance, policy making, financing, public procurement, economic development, social innovation, infrastructure and regional strategic planning.
In line with the strategy for EU international cooperation in research and innovation (COM(2012)497), international cooperation is encouraged for adapting the upscaling approaches for restoration demonstrated for use in European conditions[16] and applying them to harness transformative change internationally.
Project consortia must evidence that they have the rights to undertake actions on the areas to be restored. No land purchase or lease can be funded under this topic. Projects are expected to mobilise additional funding or in-kind contributions when implementing restoration actions.
Proposals should dedicate appropriate resources to develop joint deliverables with all projects funded under this topic and for cooperation with other projects. Actions should use existing platforms and information sharing mechanisms relevant for restoration and nature-based solutions, giving open access to its results.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 16 and 25 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Projects are expected to give priority in their budgets for hands-on action on restoration. In order to ensure a balanced portfolio of supported actions, at least two proposals covering terrestrial and/or freshwater ecosystems, and at least two covering coastal and/or marine ecosystems will be funded.
Expected Impact:
Actions are expected to demonstrate how transformational change through ecosystem restoration delivers at large scale, delivering first visible results and examples on land and at sea by 2024, with benefits increasing in the long-term.
The project results are expected to contribute to:
maintained and enhanced natural carbon sinks and reduced greenhouse gas emissions through the important role of biodiversity, local reversal of the degradation of ecosystems, recovery of ecosystem functions, increased connectivity and resilience of ecosystems, and improved delivery of a range of ecosystem services[17];
the objectives of the European Green Deal, including the EU commitment to reduce emission by 50-55% by 2030 and become net carbon-neutral by 2050; the implementation of the EU Biodiversity Strategy for 2030[18] and the EU Nature Directives[19], the Water and Marine Strategy Framework Directives, the Farm-to-Fork Strategy, the Pollinators Initiative, the Climate Law, the Bioeconomy Strategy and Action Plan, EU Urban Policies, and the revised EU Adaptation Strategy; supporting the EU Covenant of Mayors, the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction (2015-2030), the UN Decade of Restoration including land/sea degradation neutrality, and the UN Sustainable Development Goals;
widespread and innovative scaling-up of ecosystem restoration to maintain and enhance natural carbon sinks and other ecosystem services, with a view to significantly reducing the carbon and environmental footprint of Europe;
increased restoration through uptake of public-private partnerships and (voluntary) market-based incentives for business and individuals within restoration initiatives, including as the result of trans-disciplinary research and stakeholder engagement to help identify co-funding for long-term maintenance and buy-in from the private sector;
enhanced empowerment, engagement and reconnection of local communities with nature and increased social awareness on restoration actions, and their benefits;
transformational change supporting a just transition based on investing in nature together with vulnerable regions and communities improving their resilience of in the face of rapid changes in climate and environment, economies and social conditions.

","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Climate change, energy security and local air pollution are some of the key questions for the 21st century. Urban areas in developing and emerging countries are major driving factors in growing global energy demand and Greenhouse Gas emissions.
Although cities cover only 2% of the earth's surface, 50% of the world’s population lives in cities, but they are responsible for three-quarters of the global energy consumption as well as approximately 80% of the global greenhouse gas emissions. While the trend towards urbanisation and the associated increase of personal and freight transport creates massive challenges, in particular in developing and emerging economies, it also offers the unique opportunity to shape energy use especially in the transport and urban form towards a low carbon pathway. Moving towards sustainable mobility will also help addressing urban congestion, access to jobs and public services, and local air pollution.
This is why urbanisation requires integrated mobility solutions that bring together technology opportunities with local and national policy, including land use and mobility planning. Efficient transport and mobility, based on a balanced mix of public and private transport and dependent on the characteristics of each city, is and will continue to be the backbone of cities’ growth and competitiveness.
Whereas environmental issues are very high on urban mobility agendas, the importance of transport in urban social and economic structures is often neglected in discussions. All three aspects of urban sustainability must be treated with equal importance and have to be examined in parallel.
Scope:
Actions should bring together European, Asian (e.g. China), CELAC (Community of Latin American and Caribbean States) and African research partners, government agencies and urban authorities, private sector and civil society with relevant expertise and competence within the corresponding cooperation framework and foster participatory engagement in urban electrification in order to reduce air pollution and CO2 emissions. All types of vehicle are considered under this topic (powered 2 wheelers, cars, buses, trucks and LDV).
Proposals should address all of the following activities:
Development of a toolbox for advanced management strategies towards a more efficient private and public electric mobility: E-mobility management strategies, focusing on smart deployment and operation of vehicles, in particular electrified vehicle, to increase mobility and energy efficiency, emission reduction and user acceptance of electrified vehicles
A smart and cooperative management of the vehicle in urban operation, (intermodal route planning, ecorouting eco-driving charging and parking infrastructure availability…).
Deployment and operation of infrastructure use charging infrastructure (conventional and wireless) and network, availability of parking places. Adaptation and integration of existing/ adapted vehicles of different types if necessary.
Efficient integration of the operations of different electrified road public transport, from e-bike to bus rapid transit ( e- BRT) including mini-buses, taxi and mobility services on demand through smart navigation and routing, coordinated traffic management, demand-responsive service and dispatching
Comparative demonstrations activities and pilots in cities will include at least one demonstrator in the following regions: Europe, Asia, Africa and CELAC (leading to a minimum of 4 city demonstrators). Demonstrations will involve local partners. Innovative concepts for electrified road public transport (passenger and freight), jointly designed through International Partnerships as a contribution to a wider sustainable mobility concept, from the perspective of a seamless mobility, taking in account the acceptance of users (travellers or freight operator).
Implementation concepts to scale up the demonstration activities. Evaluation of the relative outputs and accordingly the development of implementation concepts to scale up the demonstration activities and exploration of the sustainable mobility planning in the city transformation process :
Sustainable planning of city and transportation infrastructure: link city planning with policy discussion and implementation solutions and city goals and with any Air Quality Plans
Dedicated plans for financing solutions, including public and private operations.
Regional and international replication conditions to reach out to a larger number of cities and countries
Cooperation and synergies with ongoing activities undertaken with international initiatives such as Decarbonising Transport (International Transport Forum) and the Urban Electric Mobility Initiative (UN-Habitat) and other joint initiatives of European Member States international cooperation initiatives and the European Commission (e.g. Mobilise Your City) should be sought where appropriate.
In line with the strategy for EU international cooperation in research and innovation[1], international cooperation is encouraged.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU in the range of EUR 15 and 18 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
Proposals are expected to contribute to:
Capability to quantify the potential reduction of greenhouse gas and pollutant emissions as well as traffic congestion, by demonstrating improvements that can be achieved with new urban mobility systems and electrification, for each stakeholder in the value chain (in line with the objectives set by the COP21 and the New Urban Agenda)
UN's Sustainable Development Goals 11 ""Sustainable cities and communities"" and 13 ""Climate Action""
Reference models of the mobility system to provide a basis in order to assess the ability to replicate sustainable concepts by demonstrating the short- and long-term benefit for the stakeholders involved, and especially considering the relevant boundary conditions (i.e infrastructure, vehicle, usage needs and patterns, governance, financing schemes, urban organisation, etc) and how the result contributes to key EU policy goals (including climate goals and competitiveness of European industry)
A basis for strengthening the collaboration of the European Union with Asia (e.g. China, India, etc), Latin America (CELAC) and Africa, which also offers both a common starting point for common future legislative efforts, as well a favourable setting for new business opportunities for innovative local and European entrepreneurs.

The clean-energy transition doesn't just pose technological and scientific challenges; it also requires a better understanding of cross-cutting issues related to socioeconomic, gender, sociocultural, and socio-political issues. Addressing these issues will help to devise more effective ways of involving citizens and to better understand energy-related views and attitudes, ultimately leading to greater social acceptability as well as more durable governance arrangements and socioeconomic benefits.
Scope:
In 2018, proposals must be submitted under the theme ""Social innovation in the energy sector"", in 2019 under the theme ""Challenges facing carbon-intensive regions"" and in 2020 under the theme “Energy citizenship”. They have to address one or several of the questions listed under the respective sub-topics below. All proposals have to adopt a comparative perspective, with case studies or data from at least three European Union Member States or Associated Countries.
2018:
Social innovation[1] in the energy sector: The energy transition has given rise to various forms of social innovation, such as the emergence of energy cooperatives or that of energy ""prosumers"" consuming but also producing energy. Urban areas have emerged as major hubs for these trends, given the close proximity between citizens, businesses and institutions, facilitating linkages between sectors and the emergence of new business and service models, as well as associated governance arrangements. These issues need to be studied in more detail, with a particular focus on the following questions:
What characterizes successful examples of social innovation in the energy sector?
What enabling conditions facilitate social innovation in the energy sector and how can it be encouraged? What factors work against it?
In what way does social innovation contribute to the preservation of livelihoods and the development of new business and service models in the energy sector?
In what way does social innovation contribute to making energy more secure, sustainable and affordable? Does social innovation lead to greater competitiveness and if so, how?
Under what conditions does social innovation lead to greater acceptance of the transition towards a low-carbon energy system?
2019:
Challenges facing carbon-intensive regions: The transition to a low-carbon energy system and economy poses particular challenges for regions that are still heavily dependent on fossil-fuel-based industries or the extraction of fossil fuels themselves (""coal and carbon-intensive regions""). At the same time, this transition offers major opportunities for developing new lines of business and for increasing the competitiveness of structurally weak regions. Focusing on the past 5-10 years up to the present, particular attention should be focused on one or several of the following issues:
What are the principal socio-economic challenges facing coal and carbon-intensive regions today and what effect have these had on livelihoods and the sustainability of local and regional economies?
What coping strategies have emerged in recent years? What are the principal differences between regions that are coping well and those that are not?
To what extent have coal and carbon-intensive regions experienced outward migration in recent years and in what way has this affected their social and demographic composition?
What effect, if any, have these changes had on the rise of populism and of anti-democratic attitudes in the regions concerned?
2020:
Energy citizenship: SSH research offers many insights into the conditions favouring civic engagement, active participation and interaction with institutional or corporate actors. Such “energy citizenship” is not limited to early technology adopters or environmental activists, and it goes beyond (but also encompasses) mere “consumer involvement”. Rather than using SSH research as an instrument to achieve particular outcomes (e.g., social acceptance) it can help to understand in what kind of environments collaborative goal setting and commitment can take place, how relevant decisions are made and any trade-offs between competing goals are addressed. This has important implications for EU energy policymaking. Proposals are expected to examine the factors affecting the emergence and effectiveness of energy citizenship and its potential for achieving the decarbonisation of the energy system. This should include factors such as digitalisation, social media, social group dynamics (e.g. creating trust, finding shared goals), societal factors (e.g. institutional, corporate or legal environment), demographics and social justice. It should result in practical recommendations for policy-makers. Specifically, proposals are expected to focus on one or several of the following questions:
Is energy citizenship more likely to emerge locally, or at regional, national or supranational levels? For what reasons?
What is the relative importance of processes internal to relevant social groups (e.g., creating trust and connection, finding shared goals and solutions, building coalitions), as opposed to external environmental variables (e.g., relative openness of institutional or corporate environments, availability of sympathetic interlocutors, access to financial or other sources of support, legal or other obstacles)?
What impact does the digitisation of the energy system and the proliferation of social media have on the emergence and consolidation of energy citizenship?
Under what conditions is energy citizenship conducive to reaching broader policy goals, particularly the decarbonisation of the energy system, and under what conditions does it have the opposite effect?
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 1 and 3 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
The proposed research will:
provide a better understanding of socioeconomic, gender, sociocultural, and socio-political factors and their interrelations with technological, regulatory, and investment-related aspects, in support of the goals of the Energy Union and particularly its research and innovation pillar;[2]
Social innovation[3] in the energy sector (2018): yield practical recommendations for using the potential of social innovation to further the goals of the Energy Union, namely, to make Europe's energy system more secure, sustainable, competitive, and affordable for Europe's citizens;
Challenges facing carbon-intensive regions (2019): yield practical recommendations for addressing the challenges of the clean-energy transition for Europe's coal and carbon-intensive regions, including socioeconomic and political ones.
Energy citizenship (2020): based on a better understanding of socio-economic, gender, socio-cultural, and socio-political factors, their interrelations with technological, regulatory, and investment aspects, yield practical recommendations for harnessing energy citizenship to achieve the energy and decarbonisation goals in the European Union and Associated Countries.

","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
The energy system in Europe will follow a transition to a low-carbon future in accordance with the COP21 agreements and the European Union targets and objectives set for 2020, 2030 and 2050. Energy models that are currently used to plan, support and verify the energy policies at national and European level do not fully encompass and integrate all the new challenges posed by this transition, such as decentralisation and variability in electricity supply, the need for flexibility, short-and long-term market dynamics, integration of the energy systems, the deployment of innovative technologies and the interaction between increasing numbers of independently acting agents in liberalised markets. In addition, energy models do not always capture the determinants, barriers (including financing-related issues) and (macroeconomic) impacts of the necessary investments to secure the low-carbon transition.
Civil society is looking for improved access to the assumptions, tools and results underlying the assessment of policy options. Researchers are also looking for enhanced possibilities for open collaborative research and the use of open data sources. An enhanced transparency of modelling tools and a wider availability of data used and generated by the modelling exercises would improve access and understanding of the challenges ahead. In addition, Europe needs to continuously promote networks and platforms for dialogues on energy modelling across relevant actors and institutions in order to progress the scientific knowledge in the field and to reinforce the interaction between researchers and policy makers.
The challenge is therefore to develop new knowledge on energy system modelling to set up an open space for researchers at national and European levels to collaboratively innovate and progress in using modelling tools to understand and predict the requirements of the transition towards a low-carbon energy system. The aim is to support the development of effective and efficient policy measures, to increase consistency and comparability of modelling practices and their use in defining low-carbon transition pathways at regional, national and European level.
Scope:
Proposals must target the development of a suite of modelling tools and scenario building exercises that will contribute to a better understanding of the issues below. Proposals will address all of the following issues:
A better representation of recent and future aspects of the European energy system in transition. For power generation, it includes aspects such as decentralisation, variability, the need for flexibility, and real market functioning. For demand, it includes the behaviour of individuals and communities of actors. It should also help address issues such as the integration of energy sectors (electricity, heating/cooling and gas).
Greater transparency and access to assumptions, data, model outputs and to tools used in modelling exercises. A collaborative environment for research on modelling, scenario and pathways development including ex-post validation and inter-comparison exercises should be proposed. Interaction with energy transition modelling activities in member states and with energy and climate policy makers.
A better representation of the investment determinants, barriers (energy market and regulatory failures) and impacts of actors: individuals, communities, private and public actors and cover the deployment of innovative technologies. This should help represent policy measures that address barriers and market failures. The exploration of energy and macroeconomic relationships, including via the investment channels, would also create a clearer understanding of macro-economic impacts of the low-carbon transition.
The organisation of an annual conference on energy modelling, bringing together the relevant experts and policy-makers, would be an important asset.
The Commission considers the proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between 4 and 5 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
The supported projects are expected to contribute to:
A better adequacy of energy system modelling approaches to model the transition to a low-carbon energy system and to encompass the new challenges posed by the energy transition driven by the Energy Union with its targets and objectives for 2020, 2030 and 2050;
Improve the understanding of energy systems by enhancing the transparency of modelling engines and practices and making data and knowledge more widely available. Increase the sharing of modelling infrastructures and databases:
Increase openness to collaborative research on energy system modelling as well as the provision of more complete information on policy options and their assessment to civil society and decision-makers.
Better representation of the determinants, barriers and impacts of investments by actors: individuals, communities, and private and public actors. Allow better design and representation of policy measures that address barriers and market failures;
Promote a coherence of modelling practices at regional, national and European levels, allowing an assessment of cross-border effects and the comparison and integration of individual approaches;
Provide a clearer understanding of the macro-economic impacts of the low-carbon transition.

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Based on results of the BUILD UP Skills initiative[1], in particular the National Qualification Platforms and Roadmaps, as well as the qualification and training schemes developed in various European countries, the challenge is now to act at market level and to support legislative changes that will stimulate the demand for sustainable energy skills.
The objective is to increase the number of skilled building professionals (“blue collar” and “white collar” professions) across the building design, operation and maintenance value chain (e.g. designers, architects, engineers, building managers, technicians, installers, on-site workers and craftsmen, including apprentices, and other building professionals), with a specific focus on the engagement of SMEs. Recourse to skilled professionals for renovations and new constructions of buildings as well as district scale solutions should be made more attractive and easier for companies (e.g. ESCOs) and home owners alike.
Scope:
The focus of submitted proposals should be on the direct stimulation of demand for energy skills in construction. This is calling for the development, up-scaling and/or combination of a range of tools and initiatives, e.g.:
Tools facilitating the mutual recognition of energy skills and qualifications in the building sector: development of sustainable energy skills passports/registers for building professionals at regional/national level and support for their take up at European level; mobile applications facilitating the comparison of professionals’ skills and qualifications between countries (e.g. by enabling the direct comparison of learning outcomes);
National, regional or local initiatives raising awareness of home and building owners and tenants about the benefits of sustainable energy skills and providing financial incentives for renovations and new constructions done using skilled professionals;
Support to public authorities for the development of new legislative frameworks, e.g. requirements for skilled professionals in public procurement;
Partnerships with producers and retailers of construction products (e.g. DIY stores) to raise awareness of the salesforce and of consumers about energy efficient products, skilled professionals and good practice in new constructions and renovations;
Initiatives reinforcing the link between skills/education and energy performance/quality of construction e.g. tools showing the reduction of the building’s performance gap as result of an increase quality of the works.
Proposals need to be focused and are not necessarily required to address the whole range of professions and crafts involved in the building sector. They may however consider the entire design chain (e.g. manufacturers). If the proposal addresses specifically design, material life cycles and embodied energy have to be considered.
Adequate consideration should also be given to the multiple benefits of energy efficiency, to improved appreciation of the end user's needs including the quality of indoor environment (thermal and visual comfort, acoustics, air quality, etc.) as well as to the building’s improved operation and maintenance.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 0.5 and 1 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
Proposals are expected to demonstrate, depending on the scope addressed, the impacts listed below using quantified indicators and targets wherever possible:
Primary Energy savings triggered by the project (in GWh/year);
Renewable energy production triggered by the project (in GWh/year);
Investments in sustainable energy triggered by the project (in million Euro);
Increased number of certification schemes for energy efficiency skills;
Improved mutual recognition of sustainable energy skills between Member States and neighbouring countries;
Improved collaboration and understanding across different trades and professional groups;
Increased market acceptance of sustainable energy skills;
Legislative changes stimulating the demand for energy skilled building professionals;
Demonstrated reduction in the gap between designed and actual energy performance through improved quality of construction.
Additional positive effects can be quantified and reported when relevant and wherever possible:
Reduction of the greenhouse gases emissions (in tCO2-eq/year) and/or air pollutants (in kg/year) triggered by the project.

","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
The clean-energy transition doesn't just pose technological and scientific challenges; it also requires a better understanding of cross-cutting issues related to socioeconomic, gender, sociocultural, and socio-political issues. Addressing these issues will help to devise more effective ways of involving citizens and to better understand energy-related views and attitudes, ultimately leading to greater social acceptability as well as more durable governance arrangements and socioeconomic benefits.
Scope:
In 2018, proposals must be submitted under the theme ""Social innovation in the energy sector"", in 2019 under the theme ""Challenges facing carbon-intensive regions"" and in 2020 under the theme “Energy citizenship”. They have to address one or several of the questions listed under the respective sub-topics below. All proposals have to adopt a comparative perspective, with case studies or data from at least three European Union Member States or Associated Countries.
2018:
Social innovation[1] in the energy sector: The energy transition has given rise to various forms of social innovation, such as the emergence of energy cooperatives or that of energy ""prosumers"" consuming but also producing energy. Urban areas have emerged as major hubs for these trends, given the close proximity between citizens, businesses and institutions, facilitating linkages between sectors and the emergence of new business and service models, as well as associated governance arrangements. These issues need to be studied in more detail, with a particular focus on the following questions:
What characterizes successful examples of social innovation in the energy sector?
What enabling conditions facilitate social innovation in the energy sector and how can it be encouraged? What factors work against it?
In what way does social innovation contribute to the preservation of livelihoods and the development of new business and service models in the energy sector?
In what way does social innovation contribute to making energy more secure, sustainable and affordable? Does social innovation lead to greater competitiveness and if so, how?
Under what conditions does social innovation lead to greater acceptance of the transition towards a low-carbon energy system?
2019:
Challenges facing carbon-intensive regions: The transition to a low-carbon energy system and economy poses particular challenges for regions that are still heavily dependent on fossil-fuel-based industries or the extraction of fossil fuels themselves (""coal and carbon-intensive regions""). At the same time, this transition offers major opportunities for developing new lines of business and for increasing the competitiveness of structurally weak regions. Focusing on the past 5-10 years up to the present, particular attention should be focused on one or several of the following issues:
What are the principal socio-economic challenges facing coal and carbon-intensive regions today and what effect have these had on livelihoods and the sustainability of local and regional economies?
What coping strategies have emerged in recent years? What are the principal differences between regions that are coping well and those that are not?
To what extent have coal and carbon-intensive regions experienced outward migration in recent years and in what way has this affected their social and demographic composition?
What effect, if any, have these changes had on the rise of populism and of anti-democratic attitudes in the regions concerned?
2020:
Energy citizenship: SSH research offers many insights into the conditions favouring civic engagement, active participation and interaction with institutional or corporate actors. Such “energy citizenship” is not limited to early technology adopters or environmental activists, and it goes beyond (but also encompasses) mere “consumer involvement”. Rather than using SSH research as an instrument to achieve particular outcomes (e.g., social acceptance) it can help to understand in what kind of environments collaborative goal setting and commitment can take place, how relevant decisions are made and any trade-offs between competing goals are addressed. This has important implications for EU energy policymaking. Proposals are expected to examine the factors affecting the emergence and effectiveness of energy citizenship and its potential for achieving the decarbonisation of the energy system. This should include factors such as digitalisation, social media, social group dynamics (e.g. creating trust, finding shared goals), societal factors (e.g. institutional, corporate or legal environment), demographics and social justice. It should result in practical recommendations for policy-makers. Specifically, proposals are expected to focus on one or several of the following questions:
Is energy citizenship more likely to emerge locally, or at regional, national or supranational levels? For what reasons?
What is the relative importance of processes internal to relevant social groups (e.g., creating trust and connection, finding shared goals and solutions, building coalitions), as opposed to external environmental variables (e.g., relative openness of institutional or corporate environments, availability of sympathetic interlocutors, access to financial or other sources of support, legal or other obstacles)?
What impact does the digitisation of the energy system and the proliferation of social media have on the emergence and consolidation of energy citizenship?
Under what conditions is energy citizenship conducive to reaching broader policy goals, particularly the decarbonisation of the energy system, and under what conditions does it have the opposite effect?
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 1 and 3 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
The proposed research will:
provide a better understanding of socioeconomic, gender, sociocultural, and socio-political factors and their interrelations with technological, regulatory, and investment-related aspects, in support of the goals of the Energy Union and particularly its research and innovation pillar;[2]
Social innovation[3] in the energy sector (2018): yield practical recommendations for using the potential of social innovation to further the goals of the Energy Union, namely, to make Europe's energy system more secure, sustainable, competitive, and affordable for Europe's citizens;

","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
The transition to a low-carbon energy system poses a unique set of policy, technological and scientific challenges, changes the fundamental nature of the interrelations between all actors in our societies (from energy incumbents to regulators and citizens), and requires the engagement of all stakeholders. Not only is there a need to find novel approaches to the development and application of technological or social processes as they relate to the energy transition, but also to a better understanding of how these changes impact people’s behaviour, pervasive values, cultures of practice and modes of communication. It also entails the need to engage all stakeholders, foster cooperation between them, align their actions to the achievement of commonly agreed goals.
Scope:
Proposals will have to support sector-specific stakeholder fora along the following lines:
Support the coordination of stakeholders' activities in the context of the SET-Plan European Technology Innovation Platforms (especially towards the progress of the strategic R&I Implementation Plans identified in the different technological areas in the context of the SET-Plan Key Actions), in particular in the area of
PV;
Ocean energy;
Wind energy;
Renewable Fuels and Bioenergy;
Renewable Heating and Cooling (RHC); and
Zero emission fossil fuel power plants and energy intensive industry.
All relevant stakeholders of the hydropower sector will be brought together in a forum including workshops and online discussion groups in order to identify research and innovation needs and priorities, to share knowledge at the European level between basic science, the research and industrial value chain, civil society and European and national authorities, to support the discussion with up-to-date information. The forum will produce a synthesis of expected research developments and research needs for the coming decades in a technology roadmap and research and innovation agenda in the hydropower sector, targeting an energy system with high flexibility and renewable share.
Building on the platform for energy-related SSH research that was set up during the pilot phase, the dialogue among different SSH stakeholders - as well as with other energy-research communities, fostering interdisciplinarity as well as knowledge and information sharing – should be continued and enhanced. This includes promoting the generation of novel, evidence-based research designed to inform and influence relevant policy processes, particularly in the context of the Energy Union and the transition to a low-carbon energy system. The platform will be sought after by European policymakers as a source of specific expertise and advice on how best to integrate SSH aspects in energy-related policymaking.
Taking into account that private investment is the most important contributor to the Energy Union’s Research and Innovation priorities, this action will support the coordination of the industrial participation in the SET Plan. It will in particular focus on the execution of the implementation plans of the SET Plan nine non-nuclear priority actions to reach the strategic targets agreed by the SET Plan Steering Group to enhance European competitiveness in clean energy innovation. In order to reach this goal, the action will promote collaboration and the development of cross thematic synergies among actors who are interested in bringing new clean energy innovations to the market, in particular from the European industry-driven associations and initiatives such as the European Technology and Innovation platforms (ETIPs), European Joint Technology Initiatives or other relevant public-private partnerships, and importantly the industrial actors identified in the 13 non–nuclear SET plan implementation plans. A key task of this action will be to help further define adequate financial strategies to mobilise investments from different sources to fulfil the implementation plans. In line with the SET Plan principles, financial resources will come mainly from industry and national public funds. The use of complementary European funds will be promoted whenever relevant (e.g. from ESIF and the risk sharing facility InnovFin EDP recently significantly enlarged in terms of funding and scope to channel undisbursed funds from NER300 and to prepare the future Innovation Fund). The focus of the action will be European, establishing links with the corresponding sectorial fora in Europe and with other international initiatives in the clean energy domain, such as Mission Innovation.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of up to EUR 1 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
Coordinated stakeholders' activities in the different sectors, providing specific and extensive advice to EU policymakers on energy-related research policy-making, continuing to foster social innovation and social dialogue in the energy field at European level, contributing towards the progress of the strategic research and innovation Implementation Plans identified in the context of the SET-Plan.

","08 September 2020","Specific Challenge:
Forests play a vital role in Europe's economy, society and environment[1]. Scenarios likely to keep the global warming below 2oC (Paris Agreement goal) would entail a substantial reduction of anthropogenic GHG emissions, through far-reaching changes to energy systems, land use and associated value chains. The second consumer-driven factor of GHG emissions is the construction sector (ca. 15%), implying a significant role for forest-based products. The forest-based sector can contribute to climate change mitigation through increasing sinks in and reducing emissions from living biomass, soils and wood products, and the substitution of non-renewable resources through the sustainable use of material and energy use of wood-based materials. The combined sink and substitution effects of wood value chains can provide a key mitigation option, provided that changes in fossil and biogenic carbon are taken into account in a comprehensive and balanced manner. Climate change is at the same time increasing forests' vulnerability. Several research projects[2] and COST Actions[3] launched in FP7 looked into the development of innovative, resource efficient wood-based products. While ensuring the sustainability of forest production systems under changing climate conditions remains a long-term objective for the sector, a key challenge now is to further develop and deploy the technological advancements of environmental and micro/macroclimate-friendly wood-based value chains on the ground.
Scope:
A. [2019] Building with wood (IA)
Proposals shall develop and test new technologies and environmental friendly solutions for the use of wood-based materials in the (re)construction and/or retrofitting of buildings. Proposals should also explore options for building with wood in combination with composite/hybrid materials, linkages with other nature-based solutions, make use of ICT, and consider LCA and carbon accounting, ‘environmental documentation’ (i.e. product definitions, standards and construction codes), performance standards, public policies and regulations, consumer perception and engagement/co-creation. Activities could include limited research and shall produce plans and arrangements or designs for new, altered or improved products, processes or services. For this purpose they may include prototyping, testing, demonstrating, piloting, large-scale product validation and market replication. Proposals shall ensure that relevant actors (researchers, citizens, policy makers from urban/rural areas, businesses, architects, site-managers, etc.) work together during the whole research and innovation process in order to better align the process and its outcomes with the societal values, needs and expectations.
B. [2020] Resilient forest systems (RIA)
Proposals shall aim at enhancing the adaptation of forest ecosystems (both primary and secondary) and forest production systems to the growing societal demands for forest products (i.e. wood and non-wood) and ecosystem services, considering trade-offs, climate change and vulnerability to natural disturbances (e.g. storms, droughts, pathogens, wild fires). Restoration of degraded ecosystems and natural expansion of forests, considering the long-term rural development, climate change mitigation objectives and biodiversity enhancement are also in the scope. Proposals shall encompass a varied range of forest and site types and tailored forest management systems representative of Europe's biogeographic regions. Proposals shall cover multiple parts of the production cycle and related operations, from regeneration/planting to harvesting, shall consider jointly supply (i.e. primary production) and demand (i.e. socio-economic) factors, and are expected to be interdisciplinary[4] in nature.
Both sub-topics (A and B) are suitable for INCO and SMEs participation, and are expected to integrate technology with SSH and RRI aspects.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of the order of EUR 10 million for sub-topic A and 5 million for sub-topic B would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
In the framework of SDG 9, 11, 13 and 15, , the EU's Forest Strategy 2013, the Circular Economy Package 2015, the Paris Agreement 2015, the EU's Bioeconomy Strategy 2018, and the EU Action Plan for Nature, People and the Economy, proposals are expected to assess how they will contribute to:
Increased resource and/or energy efficiency and added value and minimising pollution and the environmental footprint (emissions of GHG and air pollutants included) in the construction sector in the cities, by specific amounts/proportions to be specified in the proposals, by 2030 [sub-topic A];
Enhanced connectivity of rural-urban areas and their overall contribution to a resilient, circular and competitive, forest-based bioeconomy, by 2025 [sub-topic A];
Increased long-term resilience of forest production systems and associated value chains to climate/environmental change and societal demand [sub-topic B];
Protection and restoration of biodiversity of primary and secondary forest[sub-topic B];
Enhanced contribution of the forest-based sector to long-term climate change mitigation, adaptation and rural development objectives [sub-topics A & B];
Also in the long-term, prompt a sizeable positive change to European landscapes and economies, by keeping the countryside green and serving to make cities greener, and increasing the share of both decent and green jobs [sub-topics A & B].
Advance available solutions from TRL 4-5 to TRL 6-7 for sub-topic A and from TRL 3-4 to TRL 5 sub-topic B.

The Energy Efficiency Directive, in its art.8, requires Member States to develop programmes encouraging SMEs to undergo energy audits and to implement the recommended energy-saving measures. SMEs represent enormous energy saving potential. However, the lack of expertise, time and capital, including energy audit supporting scheme, often prevents SMEs from implementing energy conservation measures or from getting access to the energy services market.
The effectiveness of energy audit recommendations is influenced by people's behaviours and the improvement of enterprises' energy cultures. The availability of reliable energy consumption data is of utmost importance to monitor the impact of energy saving measures and behaviours. The actions should lead SMEs to become fully aware of the multiple benefits resulting from energy audits as well as facilitating their actual implementation. Moreover, capacity building programmes should also support implementation of the recommended energy-saving measures both for small and large enterprises.

Proposals should focus on one, or more, of the following issues:
Staff trainings and capacity buildings programmes, facilitating SMEs to undergo energy audits and to implement the recommended energy-saving measures, shall be developed according to SMEs specificities (size, sectors, lifetime of the company etc.) and highlighting the financial aspects. Programmes should aim at bridging the gap between demand and supply side (SMEs, auditors, finance institutions, managing authorities of supporting schemes). An active participation of both managerial and operational staff must be ensured. The proposed solution should be tailored to national/local conditions in order to ensure the effective uptake by the SMEs.
Capacity building to support the take-up of audits recommendations and undertake the actions necessary to reduce energy consumption (maintenance or investments in new equipment but possibly also behavioural actions) in the companies required to undergo energy audits (large enterprises). Development and implementation of corporate policy measures involving all actors (from decision makers/corporate board members to employees in each department) willing to undertake more efficient energy-related actions (motivations, behaviour change, mitigation of perceived risks and barriers).

Many project promoters – public authorities, individuals or businesses – lack the skills and capacity to set up, implement and finance ambitious low-energy and clean energy building projects. In addition, many project developers still face obstacles in raising the necessary up-front costs for their projects – particularly as the small-size of investments and the lack of turnkey solutions increase implementation cost – and lack access to attractive and adequate financing products from the market.
Scope:
This topic aims at creating or replicating innovative local or regional ""integrated home renovation services"". The developed services should cover the whole ""customer journey"" from technical and social diagnosis, technical offer, contracting of works, structuring and provision of finance (e.g. loans or EPCs), to the monitoring of works and quality assurance. Such integrated services should be operational at the end of the project and create more demand for holistic approaches as a result of improved offer by trustful market operators and better awareness from homeowners.

Proposals should build upon the promising experiences of integrated renovation services emerging in Europe[1] and aim at developing / improving economically viable business models, ultimately running without the need for public subsidies.
Projects funded under this topic will optimise the services required along the renovation process (based on a thorough analysis of the local needs and actors in place), improve trust and awareness of homeowners towards such services, reduce renovation costs and time on-site through standardised approaches (e.g. optimized business processes, standardised contractual arrangements, branding of the proposed services etc.), mainstreaming innovative technical solutions adapted to the local context, help improve their legal and regulatory environment, and overall improve financing conditions for energy renovation.
The services can be developed through dedicated operators (new public or public/private entity or mandated private operator) and/or through an improved co-ordination between existing local actors.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 0.5 and 1.5 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.

Many project promoters – public authorities, individuals or businesses – lack the skills and capacity to set up, implement and finance ambitious low-energy and clean energy building projects. In addition, many project developers still face obstacles in raising the necessary up-front costs for their projects – particularly as the small-size of investments and the lack of turnkey solutions increase implementation cost – and lack access to attractive and adequate financing products from the market.
Scope:
This topic aims at creating or replicating innovative local or regional ""integrated home renovation services"". The developed services should cover the whole ""customer journey"" from technical and social diagnosis, technical offer, contracting of works, structuring and provision of finance (e.g. loans or EPCs), to the monitoring of works and quality assurance. Such integrated services should be operational at the end of the project and create more demand for holistic approaches as a result of improved offer by trustful market operators and better awareness from homeowners.

","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Since the adoption of RES Directive in 2009, most Member States have experienced significant growth in renewable energy production and consumption, and both the EU and a large majority of Member States are on track towards the 2020 RES targets. At the same time the cost of energy from renewable energy sources has decreased significantly and the performance and market penetration of these sources has increased. Nevertheless, there is still a lot of market potential to be exploited. This potential is recognised in the ""Clean Energy for all Europeans"" package adopted at the end of 2016, which sets renewable energy targets for 2030 and introduces modifications in the energy market design, while empowering individuals or communities to participate actively to the energy system transformation. Furthermore, in June 2018 member states agreed to set an overall EU renewable energy target of 32% by 2030. Challenges exist for renewable energy to realise its full potential in all sectors and accelerate the clean energy transition, playing a crucial role in leading to an increased share of renewable energy consumed in the EU and to a more active role for the consumers.
The introduction and deployment of renewable energy at large scale requires overcoming a number of barriers. These cover issues such as consumer acceptance, legal and financial challenges related to the introduction of novel solutions into a technical and business environment with incumbent established solutions in place, necessity of making renewable energy solutions compliant with the new legislations, facilitation of legislative and regulatory aspects limiting innovative energy solutions implementation at the grid levels and also at the community or citizen level. Improving existing tools for better assessing the environmental, economic and social impact of renewable energy solutions is challenging due the breadth and scope of the different renewable technologies. The challenges are also related to creating a renewable energy sector fit for massive deployment in the market, which means ensuring that complete value chains for a broad range of renewable energy technologies are in place, not only covering raw materials (such as e.g. bioenergy feedstock) logistics but also components availability and operational reliability; and ensuring that renewables are fit to the market and capable to provide additional services to the grid. The energy markets outside the EU must not be forgotten, as they represent the most significant long term opportunity growth of the sector, but the penetration of these markets is a challenge in itself too.
Scope:
The proposal will develop solution(s) addressing one or more of the identified challenge(s), for the entire renewable energy sector or focusing on a specific energy market, such as electricity, heating, cooling or renewable fuels. The proposed solution can be developed to address a local challenge but should have wide potential for reapplication. The solution must have a long term viability and not be limited to an ad-hoc fix. The methodologies applied may be inspired by successful approaches already tested in other fields or contexts.
For all actions, the consortia have to involve and/or engage relevant stakeholders and market actors who are committed to adopting/implementing the results. The complexity of these challenges and of the related market uptake barriers may call for multi-disciplinary approaches, which should include contributions from the social sciences and humanities. Where relevant, regional specificities, socio-economic, gender-related, spatial and environmental aspects will be considered from a life-cycle perspective.
Where relevant, proposals are expected to also assess the legal, institutional and political frameworks at local, national and European level and examine how, why and under what conditions these (could) act as a barrier or an enabler.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 1 to 3 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
It is expected that the solution proposed will facilitate the wider uptake of renewable energy generation in the energy and industrial sectors leading to an increase share of renewable energy in the final energy consumption by 2030. The solution will contribute to substantial and measurable reductions in the project development timings and efforts, whilst fully addressing the needs for environmental impact assessments and public engagement. It will also contribute to provide a basis for the development of more informed policy, market support and financial frameworks, notably at national, regional and local level, leading to more cost effective support schemes and lower financing costs for RES facilities.

","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
The COP21 Paris Agreement recognises the role of cities and calls on them to rapidly reduce greenhouse gas emissions and adapting to climate change. The EU is committed to implementing the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, including Sustainable Development Goal 11 (""Make cities inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable""). Many forward-looking cities have set themselves climate goals whose achievement rests on wide scale roll out of highly integrated and highly efficient energy systems.
To achieve the necessary energy transition in cities, it is essential to increase energy systems integration and to push energy performance levels significantly beyond the levels of current EU building codes and to realize Europe wide deployment of Positive Energy Districts by 2050[1].
This call will also contribute to the specific objectives of the SET Plan action 3.2 - Smart cities and communities - focussing on positive-energy blocks/districts[2].
Scope:
Integrated innovative solutions for Positive Energy Blocks/Districts will be developed and tested and performance-monitored in the Lighthouse Cities. Projects will consider the interaction and integration between the buildings, the users and the larger energy system as well as implications of increased deployment of electro-mobility, its impact on the energy system and its integration in planning.
Lighthouse Cities will closely collaborate with Fellow Cities[3] and should act as exemplars helping to plan and initiate the replication of the deployed solutions in the Fellow cities, adapted to different local conditions.
As a sustainable energy transition will see increased electro-mobility, its impact on the energy system needs to be understood and well integrated in planning.
Definition: Positive Energy Blocks/Districts consist of several buildings (new, retro-fitted or a combination of both) that actively manage their energy consumption and the energy flow between them and the wider energy system. Positive Energy Blocks/Districts have an annual positive energy balance[4]. They make optimal use of elements such as advanced materials (e.g. bio-based materials), local RES, local storage, smart energy grids, demand-response, cutting edge energy management (electricity, heating and cooling), user interaction/involvement and ICT.
Positive Energy Blocks/Districts are designed to be integral part of the district/city energy system and have a positive impact on it (also from the circular economy point of view). Their design is intrinsically scalable and they are well embedded in the spatial, economic, technical, environmental and social context of the project site.
To increase impact beyond the demonstration part of the project, each Lighthouse City and Fellow City will develop during the project, together with the consortium partners, its own bold city-vision for 2050[5]. The vision should cover urban, technical, financial and social aspects. Each vision will come with its guide for the city on how to move from planning, to implementation, to replication and scaling up of successful solutions.
Proposals should also:
Focus on mixed use urban districts and positively contribute to the overall city goals;
Develop solutions that can be replicated/gradually scaled up to city level. The technical, financial, social, environmental and legal feasibility of the proposed solutions should be demonstrated in the actual proposal.
Make local communities and local governments (particularly city planning departments) an active and integral part of the solution, increase their energy awareness and ensure their sense of ownership of the smart solutions. This should ensure sustainability of Positive Energy Blocks/Districts;
Promote decarbonisation, while improving air quality, also assessing the benefits of the implemented solutions by means of Life Cycle Assessment and air quality modelling.
Projects will incorporate performance monitoring of at least 2 years of deployed solutions from the earliest feasible moment[6]. All relevant performance data must be incorporated into the Smart Cities Information System database (SCIS)[7].
Projects should also deliver:
Effective business models for sustainable solutions;
Practical recommendations arising from project experience on:
regulatory, legal aspects and data security/protection;
gender and socio-economics (Social Sciences and Humanities);
storage solutions (from short-term to seasonal);
big data, data management and digitalisation;
electro-mobility: i) its impact on energy system and ii) appropriate city planning measures to support large scale roll-out;
Eligible costs are primarily those that concern the innovative elements of the project needed to:
connect and integrate buildings;
enable Positive Energy Blocks/Districts;
foster innovative systems integration;
complement the wider energy system.
Costs of commercial technologies are not eligible, for example:
Buildings: purchase, construction, retrofitting and maintenance;
Electric vehicles and charging stations: purchase, installation and maintenance;
City-level ICT platforms: purchase, development and maintenance;
Standard, commercially-available RES: purchase, development and maintenance.
Projects are expected to cooperate with other Smart Cities and Communities projects funded under Horizon 2020[8] in the Smart city Lighthouse group as well as the European Innovation Partnership on Smart Cities and Communities (EIP-SCC)[9].
Therefore, proposals will foresee a work package for cooperation with other selected projects and earmark appropriate resources (5% of the requested EU contribution) for coordination and communication efforts and research work associated with cross-cutting issues.
Projects can make use of financial support to third parties for up to 5% of the EU contribution to the project for the incorporation of relevant innovation boosting activities/actions (e.g. SMEs, start-up competitions, Prizes, etc).
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 15 to 20 million[10] would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Typically, projects should have a duration of 48 to 60 months.
Expected Impact:
Projects should contribute to:
Meeting EU climate mitigation and adaptation goals and national and/or local energy, air quality and climate targets, as relevant;
Increased share of i) renewable energies, ii) waste heat recovery and iii) storage solutions (including batteries) and their integration into the energy system;
Lead the way towards wide scale roll out of Positive Energy Districts;
Significantly improved energy efficiency, district level optimized self-consumption, reduced curtailment;
Increased uptake of e-mobility solutions;
Improved air quality.
The higher the replicability of the solutions across Europe, the better.

To replace fossil energy with sustainable alternatives that provide the same flexibility and convenience of use, we need to store sustainable energy on a large scale and for a long time in new kind of energy storage compounds. This can be done by direct conversion of sunlight into storable chemicals that can be stored for a virtually unlimited time. At present, these processes can be performed at the level of small prototype devices at high cost. Therefore, research and innovation are needed to bring these approaches from infancy to maturity. The production of clean forms of storable chemical energy from direct sunlight is the next step.
Performance breakthroughs, including day and night continuous processes, and cost reductions are a must in order to unlock the potential of technologies converting sunlight to storable chemical energy.
This challenge is fully aligned to the ""Converting Sunlight Innovation Challenge""[1] identified as a priority in Mission Innovation.
Scope:
Proposals are expected to address renewable energy technologies that will answer the challenge described in the ""Converting Sunlight Innovation Challenge"" of Mission Innovation, bringing them up to TRL 4 or 5. Beside the technological development, the proposal will have to clearly address the following related aspects: the potential lower environmental impact than the current technologies, possibly through a LCA analysis, the better resource efficiency, issues related to social acceptance or resistance to new energy technologies, related socioeconomic and livelihood issues, and prospective market analysis. The proposal needs to consider all three dimensions of sustainability, resource efficiency and scalability, i.e. not using materials which are uncommon, dangerous or scarce that could disable its future concept to be used at large scale.
At least one of the following technology-specific challenges has to be addressed:
Improved light-harvesting and efficient charge separation in photocatalytic systems;
Photoelectrochemical cells – PECs and catalyst development;
Thermochemical pathways to energy rich chemicals (using concentrated solar light); and
Design and engineering of devices, systems or prototypes integrating together the different processes, with day and night control and applicability for the production of chemical energy rich carriers.
The area of electrolysers efficiently utilizing a renewable electricity input, such as provided by photovoltaics, wind turbines or other sustainable means, is not covered by this challenge.
The proposal must have a plausible pathway to scale the technology to the terawatt scale by 2050, a plausible potential for an EROI > 10 (EROI: Energy returned on energy invested) and the full recyclability of the conversion devices in the context of a circular economy must be ensured.
As part of Mission Innovation actions, the project will be required to contribute towards the activities of the ""Converting Sunlight Innovation Challenge"". Beside solving the technical challenge, the consortium is expected to budget the participation in the development of the Challenge work plan through activities such as dissemination, exchange of researcher and networking as well as through contributing in official meetings.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 2 to 3 million would allow this challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
Projects will not only contribute to mitigating climate change through the production of storable chemical energy from the sun, but also enhance energy security and provide opportunities for economic development across the globe.
Projects should show its contribution towards establishing a solid European innovation base and building a sustainable renewable energy system.

Work will take into account the potential of traditional and innovative techniques and sensors and test their effectiveness in mitigating/buffering the effects of different weather events (such as drought, heat and cold waves, wind, heavy rain and flooding). Activities will maximise the time and space resolution of decision support systems to increase their effectiveness and reliability. Studies at landscape scale are required to understand leading ecological processes; therefore activities will include collaboration and coordination between farmers and between farmers and other stakeholders. Activities should look at the wider impacts of trade-offs and synergies between microclimate management and related policies (Water Framework Directive, Biodiversity Action Plans, Common Agricultural Policy, EU Adaptation Strategy) on agri-ecosystems and their surroundings. Proposals will use transdisciplinary research methods and should fall under the concept of the 'multi-actor approach'[1]. Proposals should establish a farm and landscape-level observatory and knowledge-exchange network on regional risks and microclimate management. They should build links with the European Innovation Partnership ""Agricultural productivity and sustainability"" and showcase good practices to be replicated.
B. [2019] Efficiency and resilience of mixed farming and agroforestry systems (RIA)
Activities will develop further mixed farming systems and show how the integration of crops, livestock and forestry activities can improve the resilience of agriculture in combination with the related climate change mitigation potential (e.g. carbon sequestration, nutrient recycling). Proposals should enable the participative design of mixed farming and agroforestry systems not only focusing on technical and agronomic aspects but also taking on board socio-economic aspects of mixed farming modes, the related value chains and necessary infrastructures as well as the environmental and climate mitigation and adaptation potential. Proposals will contribute to increase synergies between crops and livestock by defining optimal combinations of production to increase income stability at farm level and sustainability of the relevant value chains. They shall develop models and tools adapted to real farm management to grasp the inherent complexity of mixed farming and agroforestry systems. Proposed work shall benefit both the conventional and organic sectors. Activities will use transdisciplinary research methods and proposals should fall under the concept of the 'multi-actor approach'[2].
All sub-topics- The proposals funded under this topic (sub-topics A and B) will contribute to the development of a conceptual framework on resilience and mitigation at different levels (farm, community, region, national and EU) and its policy implications. Proposals should include a task to cluster with other projects financed under the same topic. The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of up to EUR 7 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
Funded activities will improve the climate and socio-economic resilience of the agricultural sector. In the short to medium term work will:
Deliver effective solutions for ensuring the highest level of implementation on the farm and landscape scale regarding climate-smart and resilient systems and provide decision support systems adapted to mixed farming and agroforestry systems in heterogeneous landscapes;
Unlock and improve viability and replicability of efficient and resilient farming systems and propose different transition scenarios leading to the development of modern land use systems, value chains and infrastructures;
Reduce the environmental impact of farming and contribute towards mitigation and adaptation to climate change;
Provide ecosystem services through integrated and small-scale land management.
In the longer term funded activities will help to foster the synergies between agricultural production, climate change mitigation and adaptation. They will allow the farming sector to continue fulfilling its multiple functions under predicted, more challenging abiotic conditions.

","22 August 2017","Specific Challenge:
The technologies that will form the backbone of the energy system by 2030 and 2050 are still in the research and development cycle and need to be fully developed before they could fully demonstrate their potential value in our future energy system. It is crucial that these new technologies show evidence of promising developments and do not represent a risk to society.
Scope:
At least one of the following technology-specific challenges has to be addressed in 2016:
Photovoltaics: Developing next-generation increased efficiency high-performance crystalline silicon c-Si PV cells and modules: c-Si technology holds a dominant share of the PV market and is expected to continue playing a central role for PV industry for some time in the future. The challenge is the development of advanced high-performance c-Si cells and modules based on novel architectures and/or processes which tackle efficiency limitations while improving cost-effectiveness[1]. It is necessary to demonstrate device designs and fabrication processes of technologies with efficiencies higher than 25% at cell level and above 21 % at the module level and at the same time pilot manufacturing readiness at a competitive cost.
Concentrated Solar Power (CSP): Innovative components and configurations for CSP plants: In spite of cost reductions in recent years, cost competitiveness remains a crucial barrier to the deployment of CSP plants. Several concepts with a potential for cost reduction are being explored. It is necessary to validate in relevant environment the feasibility of these concepts. Significant improvements with regard to one or more of the elements of a CSP plant (heat transfer fluids which can be used for direct thermal energy storage[2]; the solar field; high temperature receivers allowing for new cycles) are needed to reduce the cost of this technology.
Solar Heating and cooling (SHC) [3]: Innovative components for solar compact hybrid systems: It is necessary to improve the cost competitiveness, performance and acceptability of solar compact hybrid systems (heating systems combining a solar system and a backup-heater), addressing developments needed in the areas of improved components, easier installation (plug and play), improved control and operation methods, compact and simplified design. Single family homes and/or multifamily homes and/or public buildings are particularly challenging targets, requiring assessing the implications for the user in terms of operation and maintenance of the system.
Wind energy: Advanced control of large scale wind turbines and farms: The current progress in wind energy like larger wind turbines and farms, floating offshore wind, but also specific geographical challenges, require the development of advanced control strategies to improve efficiency and to further reduce the cost of wind energy as well as to increase the value of wind energy by improving the response to power system disturbances or electricity market conditions. While one of the primary challenges to be addressed is the development of new controls systems that treat the entire wind plant as a controls optimization problem it is also needed to optimize energy capture for individual assets with the wind-turbine-centric controls and to develop a better understanding of the wind resources and better wind forecasting methods. The overall challenge is to design an integrated approach to advanced operation of a wind turbine and/or farm, to improve performance for new and operating wind power plants and improve control of the wind turbine and/or farm, reducing the failure rate and therefore resulting in less operation and maintenance.
Ocean Energy: Increased performance and reliability of ocean energy subsystems: The priority for the ocean energy sector is to increase significantly the performance, reliability and survivability (15-20 years target) of ocean-energy devices developing solutions based on alternative approaches, sub-systems and materials. An integrated research and development approach is needed to reach maximum impact for the whole sector, and to make ocean energy commercially attractive for investors. The challenge resides in an improved understanding of component failure and low reliability in current ocean-energy devices, and in the development of ocean energy devices of improved performance, contributing to reduce the cost of ocean-energy. A fundamental challenge to be addressed is the development of novel and advanced reliable prime mover (e.g. system blades, pitch and hub for TECs and device structure for WECs) and the development of novel and advanced power take-off and control systems, converting mechanical energy from prime mover into grid compliant electricity.
Hydropower: Environmentally friendly hydropower solutions: There is a need to improve the understanding of river ecology and the relation to river regulation. The challenge is to provide reliable knowledge based on high quality quantified data sets and suitable methods, models and devices allowing policy makers and hydropower plant designers and operators to take decisions on the ecologic compatibility of planning and operating hydropower stations. To meet the overall objective of self-sustaining fish populations, measures such as habitat improvement, nature based environmental flows, sediment management (spawning area), and fish passage facilities or their combination may be implemented. To identify the most cost-effective measures or their-combination, it is necessary to include systematic investigations on selected power stations in various Member States of different climatic and ecologic conditions, identify fish species most at risk from hydropower projects. At the scale of the power plant the establishment of the correlations between design parameters of the plants and turbines respectively the survival rates for selected, representative species are needed to create models for fish mortality which should be verified at selected stations and assessed by testing/validating suitable prototypes/devices. Obtaining these data is fundamental to enable decision makers on all levels to plan, commission and operate hydropower plants with full respect of ecological regulations band policies and to meet the Water Framework Directive requirements.
Geothermal Energy: Shallow geothermal (low temperature) Improving borehole heat exchangers: Cost-effectiveness and efficiency of geothermal systems for heating and cooling in individual or multiple (i.e. district heating) installations can be improved introducing new and more efficient materials. Increased efficiency of heat exchangers will bring costs down and increase the attractiveness of geothermal energy for heating and cooling applications. The challenge is to develop new materials and systems to improve the efficiency of borehole heat exchangers by increasing the heat exchanged with the surrounding ground and water to make geothermal sources for heating and cooling more economically attractive.
Combined Heat and Power: Development of highly-efficient, low-emission medium- and large-scale biomass-based CHP systems. CHP has a high potential for heat and electricity production in particular for decentralised applications. However, the challenge is to increase both technology performance and resource efficiency, while reducing environmental impacts. Cost effective, robust and low emission (both CO2 NOx and particles) medium and large-scale industrial CHP (>1MW) with high thermal and electrical efficiency and increased high-temperature heat potential up to 600°C need to be developed allowing the use of a wider base of solid, liquid or gaseous sustainable biomass and recovered feedstock. Ash use or removal, as well as ash challenges during combustion, requires particular attention. A significant step forward in the technology efficiency together with a reduction in resource consumption and reduced emissions is needed, to deliver reduced costs, both operation and maintenance, and increased attractiveness of renewable heating.
RES integration in the energy system: RES system support functions for the future energy system: In a future European energy scenario with very high shares of renewables (up to 100%) in the energy mix, system support functions that are provided today by synchronous generation will need to be provided by renewable generation or procured from third parties. RES should significantly contribute to a more stable operation of the future energy system, allowing growing percentage of renewable sources to displace traditional dispatchable generation. The challenge is to define and develop system support functions or ancillary services for the contribution of different RES technologies to stable and safe energy system operations in the best technical and economic way. Development and validation of system support functions from renewables, provided at transmission and distribution grid level, is needed; there is also a need to define the most suitable pathways to include the identified functionalities needed into the different RES development roadmaps, staggering their development in parallel to the development of the network connection codes.
For 2017, at least one of the following technology-specific challenges has to be addressed:
Photovoltaics: Developing next-generation increased-efficiency high-performance perovskite PV cells and products[4]: Recently the power conversion efficiency of lead halide perovskite–based thin film photovoltaic devices achieved exceptional progress. Improvements in solution processing and stability, combined with the earth abundance of the constituent materials, have made the lead halide perovskites among the most promising solar cell materials. The challenge is to further develop perovskite solar cells toward their theoretical power conversion efficiency and their commercially and environmentally viable fabrication. It is necessary to demonstrate device designs and price competitive fabrication processes of technologies with sufficient stability and at least 21% efficiency at cell level.
Concentrated Solar Power (CSP): New cycles and innovative power blocks for CSP plants: In spite of cost reductions in recent years, cost competitiveness remains a crucial barrier to the deployment of CSP plants. Several innovative concepts for new cycles and power blocks are being explored, which have the potential for lifecycle cost reduction thereby contributing to achieve the SET-Plan targets for CSP[5]. The challenge is to validate the feasibility of these concepts in relevant environment.
Solar Heating and cooling (SHC)[6]: Development of components for residential single-family solar-active houses: The potential of solar heating can be further exploited in residential buildings to cover a significant fraction of the heat demand. Developments are needed in the areas of improved components, innovative materials, improved control and operation methods, innovative configurations. The challenge is for solar heating to cover at least 60% of the heat demand of a single family home, while minimizing the implications for the user in terms of operation and maintenance of the system.
Wind Energy: Reduction of environmental impact of wind energy: The challenge is to develop potential mitigating strategies or alternative solutions and to increase public acceptance of wind energy, thereby shortening consenting procedures, on the basis of an increased scientific understanding of the social and environmental impact of wind turbines and (clusters of) wind farms both on and off-shore (including floating) and to identify solutions for improved wind turbines/farms with less impact. Innovative mitigation actions could increase the deployment possibilities for wind energy, developing a better understanding of the impact of wind energy on the environment as there are still gaps in the knowledge which result in long consenting procedures and reduced deployment possibilities and secondly, developing innovative mitigation actions. Cooperation with NGOs and civil society groups is essential for further investigation of the roots of resistive behaviour as engaging and involving concerned communities can facilitate addressing this specific challenge.
Ocean Energy: Development of advanced ocean energy subsystems: innovative power take-off systems and control strategies: The challenge is to improve performance of ocean energy devices and reduce the overall cost of ocean energy by means of the demonstration of innovative power take-off systems and control strategies in order to increase power capture and power conversion efficiency, to reduce cost of components in the systems and to increase power quality. For the advanced sub-system an improved understanding of their interaction with energy resource is needed. Further, new system designs and methodologies are needed to enhance reliability and performance levels, making a step change in the sector and introduce as well a certain level of standardisation.
Hydropower: Increasing flexibility of hydropower: Hydropower is still amongst the largest sources of renewable energy. The challenge is however to make hydropower available in a time as short as possible independent of plant size. New technologies, generators and turbine designs need to be developed to increase ramping rates and to allow start-stop-cycles to reach up to 30 times per day depending on head and volume, while lifetime of components and respective life time prediction methods under heavy-duty operating conditions are considerably improved and at the same time avoiding adverse effects on downstream water courses. The refurbishment and simultaneous upgrading of hydropower stations offers a huge potential to increase renewable electricity production; the challenge is to leverage the storage potential of hydropower for grid balancing on the base of new technologies, finally allowing plant operators to operate successfully in the modern power markets and to make a significant contribution to European renewable energy objectives and policies.
Geothermal Energy: Deep Geothermal (medium-high temperature): Materials for geothermal installations: Geothermal resources at medium-high temperature can produce at competitive costs electricity, heat or a combination of both. With the increase of the temperature the geothermal fluids become more aggressive, corrosion and scaling might occur and the efficiency and longevity of the plant components are at stake. Geothermal plant reliability must be improved. The challenge is to develop new materials and systems to increase efficiency and longevity of the installations, by securing the integrity of the well and of the equipment, with particular reference to the pumps. Reduced well losses and increased efficiency and longevity of the plant components will lower the risks associated with deep geothermal installations and increase cost-competitiveness by reducing the replacement frequency of components.
Combined Heat and Power: Transforming renewable energy into intermediates: Biomass and other renewable and waste carbon sources offer a far unexplored potential as storable renewable energy source in integrated systems. Improving storage characteristics of upgraded biomass and other renewable and waste carbon sources will provide a flexible element for heat and power production and for balancing the grid stability, as well as for transport applications, therefore majorly contributing to the EU 2020 energy objectives. The challenge is to develop viable processes and deliver possible economic benefits along the value chain via power-to-gas and/or power-to-liquid concepts for RHC, transport and storage applications, using hydrogen or syngas or liquid renewable carriers produced from excess electricity from PV or wind for biomass gasification or liquefaction or in biogas plants to enhance the yields of syngas or biogas as well as for waste carbon upgrading.
RES integration in the energy system: RES system support functions for the future energy system: In a future European energy scenario with very high shares of renewables (up to 100%) in the energy mix, system support functions that are provided today by synchronous generation will need to be provided by renewable generation or procured from third parties. RES should significantly contribute to a more stable operation of the future energy system, allowing growing percentage of renewable sources to displace traditional dispatchable generation. The challenge is to define and develop system support functions or ancillary services for the contribution of different RES technologies to stable and safe energy system operations in the best technical and economic way is needed. Proposals should propose, develop and validate system support functions from renewables, provided at transmission and distribution grid level, and include the definition of the most suitable pathways to include the identified functionalities needed into the different RES development roadmaps, staggering their development in parallel to the development of the network connection codes.
Proposals should address one or more of the technology-specific challenges described above. Combining renewables areas, when new innovative ideas could bring breakthrough, is welcome, but the proposal should have a clear focus on at least one of the technology specific challenges. The proposals should bring technology solutions to TRL 4-5 (please see part G of the General Annexes) at the end of the action.
Environment, health and safety issues shall be considered in all developments and appropriately addressed.
Proposals shall explicitly address performance and cost targets together with relevant key performance indicators, expected impacts, as well as provide for development of explicit exploitation plans.
Technical issues, synergies between technologies, regional approaches, socio-economic and environmental aspects from a life-cycle perspective (including public resistance and acceptance, business cases, pre-normative and legal issues, pollution and recycling) need to be appropriately addressed wherever relevant. As in many cases, renewable energy projects are part of complex ecosystems, with links to broader environmental, socioeconomic and livelihood issues that are of particular relevance to local communities, multidisciplinary research designs that integrate contributions also from the social sciences and humanities are encouraged.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 2 to 5 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
Further to what mentioned for the specific technologies, proposals focusing on the technology specific challenges a) to h) should address all the general impacts listed below:
Reduce the technological risks for the next development stages;
Significantly increased technology performance;
Reducing life-cycle environmental impact;
Nurturing the development of the industrial capacity to produce components and systems and opening of new opportunities;
Contributing to the strengthening the European industrial technology base, thereby creating growth and jobs in Europe;
Reducing renewable energy technologies installation time and cost and/or operational costs, hence easing the deployment of renewable energy sources within the energy mix;
Increasing the reliability and lifetime while decreasing operation and maintenance costs, hence creating new business opportunities;
Contributing to solving the global climate and energy challenges.
The proposals focusing on the technology-specific challenge i) in 2016 and 2017 should address all the following impacts:
Improving EU energy security;
Making variable renewable electricity generation more predictable and grid friendly, thereby allowing larger amounts of variable output renewable sources in the grid;
Bringing cohesion, coherence and strategy in the development of new renewable energy technologies;
Contributing to solving the global climate and energy challenges.

Cost effective, robust and low emission (both CO2 NOx and particles) medium and large-scale industrial CHP (>1MW) with high thermal and electrical efficiency and increased high-temperature heat potential up to 600°C need to be developed allowing the use of a wider base of solid, liquid or gaseous sustainable biomass and recovered feedstock. Ash use or removal, as well as ash challenges during combustion, requires particular attention. A significant step forward in the technology efficiency together with a reduction in resource consumption and reduced emissions is needed, to deliver reduced costs, both operation and maintenance, and increased attractiveness of renewable heating.
RES integration in the energy system: RES system support functions for the future energy system: In a future European energy scenario with very high shares of renewables (up to 100%) in the energy mix, system support functions that are provided today by synchronous generation will need to be provided by renewable generation or procured from third parties. RES should significantly contribute to a more stable operation of the future energy system, allowing growing percentage of renewable sources to displace traditional dispatchable generation. The challenge is to define and develop system support functions or ancillary services for the contribution of different RES technologies to stable and safe energy system operations in the best technical and economic way. Development and validation of system support functions from renewables, provided at transmission and distribution grid level, is needed; there is also a need to define the most suitable pathways to include the identified functionalities needed into the different RES development roadmaps, staggering their development in parallel to the development of the network connection codes.
For 2017, at least one of the following technology-specific challenges has to be addressed:
Photovoltaics: Developing next-generation increased-efficiency high-performance perovskite PV cells and products[4]: Recently the power conversion efficiency of lead halide perovskite–based thin film photovoltaic devices achieved exceptional progress. Improvements in solution processing and stability, combined with the earth abundance of the constituent materials, have made the lead halide perovskites among the most promising solar cell materials. The challenge is to further develop perovskite solar cells toward their theoretical power conversion efficiency and their commercially and environmentally viable fabrication. It is necessary to demonstrate device designs and price competitive fabrication processes of technologies with sufficient stability and at least 21% efficiency at cell level.
Concentrated Solar Power (CSP): New cycles and innovative power blocks for CSP plants: In spite of cost reductions in recent years, cost competitiveness remains a crucial barrier to the deployment of CSP plants. Several innovative concepts for new cycles and power blocks are being explored, which have the potential for lifecycle cost reduction thereby contributing to achieve the SET-Plan targets for CSP[5]. The challenge is to validate the feasibility of these concepts in relevant environment.
Solar Heating and cooling (SHC)[6]: Development of components for residential single-family solar-active houses: The potential of solar heating can be further exploited in residential buildings to cover a significant fraction of the heat demand. Developments are needed in the areas of improved components, innovative materials, improved control and operation methods, innovative configurations. The challenge is for solar heating to cover at least 60% of the heat demand of a single family home, while minimizing the implications for the user in terms of operation and maintenance of the system.
Wind Energy: Reduction of environmental impact of wind energy: The challenge is to develop potential mitigating strategies or alternative solutions and to increase public acceptance of wind energy, thereby shortening consenting procedures, on the basis of an increased scientific understanding of the social and environmental impact of wind turbines and (clusters of) wind farms both on and off-shore (including floating) and to identify solutions for improved wind turbines/farms with less impact. Innovative mitigation actions could increase the deployment possibilities for wind energy, developing a better understanding of the impact of wind energy on the environment as there are still gaps in the knowledge which result in long consenting procedures and reduced deployment possibilities and secondly, developing innovative mitigation actions. Cooperation with NGOs and civil society groups is essential for further investigation of the roots of resistive behaviour as engaging and involving concerned communities can facilitate addressing this specific challenge.
Ocean Energy: Development of advanced ocean energy subsystems: innovative power take-off systems and control strategies: The challenge is to improve performance of ocean energy devices and reduce the overall cost of ocean energy by means of the demonstration of innovative power take-off systems and control strategies in order to increase power capture and power conversion efficiency, to reduce cost of components in the systems and to increase power quality. For the advanced sub-system an improved understanding of their interaction with energy resource is needed. Further, new system designs and methodologies are needed to enhance reliability and performance levels, making a step change in the sector and introduce as well a certain level of standardisation.
Hydropower: Increasing flexibility of hydropower: Hydropower is still amongst the largest sources of renewable energy. The challenge is however to make hydropower available in a time as short as possible independent of plant size. New technologies, generators and turbine designs need to be developed to increase ramping rates and to allow start-stop-cycles to reach up to 30 times per day depending on head and volume, while lifetime of components and respective life time prediction methods under heavy-duty operating conditions are considerably improved and at the same time avoiding adverse effects on downstream water courses. The refurbishment and simultaneous upgrading of hydropower stations offers a huge potential to increase renewable electricity production; the challenge is to leverage the storage potential of hydropower for grid balancing on the base of new technologies, finally allowing plant operators to operate successfully in the modern power markets and to make a significant contribution to European renewable energy objectives and policies.
Geothermal Energy: Deep Geothermal (medium-high temperature): Materials for geothermal installations: Geothermal resources at medium-high temperature can produce at competitive costs electricity, heat or a combination of both. With the increase of the temperature the geothermal fluids become more aggressive, corrosion and scaling might occur and the efficiency and longevity of the plant components are at stake. Geothermal plant reliability must be improved. The challenge is to develop new materials and systems to increase efficiency and longevity of the installations, by securing the integrity of the well and of the equipment, with particular reference to the pumps. Reduced well losses and increased efficiency and longevity of the plant components will lower the risks associated with deep geothermal installations and increase cost-competitiveness by reducing the replacement frequency of components.
Combined Heat and Power: Transforming renewable energy into intermediates: Biomass and other renewable and waste carbon sources offer a far unexplored potential as storable renewable energy source in integrated systems. Improving storage characteristics of upgraded biomass and other renewable and waste carbon sources will provide a flexible element for heat and power production and for balancing the grid stability, as well as for transport applications, therefore majorly contributing to the EU 2020 energy objectives. The challenge is to develop viable processes and deliver possible economic benefits along the value chain via power-to-gas and/or power-to-liquid concepts for RHC, transport and storage applications, using hydrogen or syngas or liquid renewable carriers produced from excess electricity from PV or wind for biomass gasification or liquefaction or in biogas plants to enhance the yields of syngas or biogas as well as for waste carbon upgrading.
RES integration in the energy system: RES system support functions for the future energy system: In a future European energy scenario with very high shares of renewables (up to 100%) in the energy mix, system support functions that are provided today by synchronous generation will need to be provided by renewable generation or procured from third parties. RES should significantly contribute to a more stable operation of the future energy system, allowing growing percentage of renewable sources to displace traditional dispatchable generation. The challenge is to define and develop system support functions or ancillary services for the contribution of different RES technologies to stable and safe energy system operations in the best technical and economic way is needed. Proposals should propose, develop and validate system support functions from renewables, provided at transmission and distribution grid level, and include the definition of the most suitable pathways to include the identified functionalities needed into the different RES development roadmaps, staggering their development in parallel to the development of the network connection codes.
Proposals should address one or more of the technology-specific challenges described above. Combining renewables areas, when new innovative ideas could bring breakthrough, is welcome, but the proposal should have a clear focus on at least one of the technology specific challenges. The proposals should bring technology solutions to TRL 4-5 (please see part G of the General Annexes) at the end of the action.
Environment, health and safety issues shall be considered in all developments and appropriately addressed.
Proposals shall explicitly address performance and cost targets together with relevant key performance indicators, expected impacts, as well as provide for development of explicit exploitation plans.
Technical issues, synergies between technologies, regional approaches, socio-economic and environmental aspects from a life-cycle perspective (including public resistance and acceptance, business cases, pre-normative and legal issues, pollution and recycling) need to be appropriately addressed wherever relevant. As in many cases, renewable energy projects are part of complex ecosystems, with links to broader environmental, socioeconomic and livelihood issues that are of particular relevance to local communities, multidisciplinary research designs that integrate contributions also from the social sciences and humanities are encouraged.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 2 to 5 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
Further to what mentioned for the specific technologies, proposals focusing on the technology specific challenges a) to h) should address all the general impacts listed below:
Reduce the technological risks for the next development stages;
Significantly increased technology performance;
Reducing life-cycle environmental impact;
Nurturing the development of the industrial capacity to produce components and systems and opening of new opportunities;
Contributing to the strengthening the European industrial technology base, thereby creating growth and jobs in Europe;
Reducing renewable energy technologies installation time and cost and/or operational costs, hence easing the deployment of renewable energy sources within the energy mix;
Increasing the reliability and lifetime while decreasing operation and maintenance costs, hence creating new business opportunities;
Contributing to solving the global climate and energy challenges.
The proposals focusing on the technology-specific challenge i) in 2016 and 2017 should address all the following impacts:
Improving EU energy security;
Making variable renewable electricity generation more predictable and grid friendly, thereby allowing larger amounts of variable output renewable sources in the grid;
Bringing cohesion, coherence and strategy in the development of new renewable energy technologies;
Contributing to solving the global climate and energy challenges.

","04 September 2019","Specific Challenge:
Nutritional imbalances in both Europe and Africa are increasing, characterised by growing diet-related, non-communicable diseases and persistent under-nutrition. The UN projects that the global population will increase from 7 billion to more than 9 billion by 2050[1], of which the majority is expected to occur in Africa. To anticipate such population growth and challenges associated with enhanced climate change, agricultural systems need to become more sustainable and better linked to nutrition performance by strengthening the agro-biodiversity of resilient cropping systems, thereby increasing the range of food products for a balanced, healthy diet. Furthermore, resource-efficient, resilient food value chains need to be developed to deliver sufficient, safe, affordable and nutritious food to local consumers and for high value global markets. Africa has a wealth of local varieties, food intelligence and healthy African diets including plant based proteins, which are currently largely untapped and not reaching the market, neither in African cities nor in Europe.
Scope:
Proposals shall assess and deliver better nutrition performance of African farming systems, strengthening the agro-biodiversity (and integrated aquaculture systems) and food diversity. They shall address innovative approaches in local food systems while covering technological, food safety, social and gender issues[2], and address sustainable postharvest technologies, including bio-based packaging, to reduce food waste along the post-harvest/consumer chain and plastic littering. Empowerment of small farmers (including aquafarmers) and processors benefitting rural areas leading to diversity of diets and improving food identity is essential. Food supply chains (conventional and organic) for both local urban markets and high value global markets shall be targeted. Proposals need to ensure the commitment and participation of a variety of partners established in the EU and in Africa, and shall establish relevant links with other projects involved in the EU-Africa Research and Innovation Partnership on Food and Nutrition Security & Sustainable Agriculture (FNSSA). Proposals should include a task to cluster with other projects involved in the EU-Africa R&I Partnership on FNSSA and with the cooperation platform established under SFS-33-2018.
The Commission considers that proposals following a multi-actor approach including civil society organisations requesting a contribution from the EU of the order of EUR 7 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
In the framework of SDG no 1, 2, 3, 8, 10, 12, 13, 15 and 17, the EU-Africa R&I Partnership on FNSSA[3], the EU's Bioeconomy Strategy 2012, and the FOOD 2030 SWD[4], proposals shall describe how projects can contribute to:
Improved food systems resulting in sustainable, healthy African diets (comparable to the Mediterranean diet) that on the short term are to become mainstream in 10 African cities;
Empowerment of small farmers (including aquafarmers) combined with sustainable growth of food chain operators (SMEs) in rural areas in Africa, both for internal markets and export;
New market opportunities for novel food products, tools and processes applicable in Africa that are taking into account food safety issues across the entire food value chain (e.g. improved food storage under mycotoxins free conditions) and reduce food waste;
Significant reduction of malnutrition in Africa and particularly in relation to children, including those within the first 1,000 days of life, by implementing nutritional recommendations (proportion/figures to be specified in the proposals as well as reflections on specific food strategies for crisis and civil war situations);
Major progress towards the establishment of the EU-Africa Research and Innovation Partnership on FNSSA and impact at local level;

","22 August 2017","Specific Challenge:
The technologies that will form the backbone of the energy system by 2030 and 2050 are still under development. Promising technologies for energy conversion are being developed at laboratory scale and need to be scaled up in order to demonstrate their potential value in our future energy system. These new technologies should provide more flexibility to the energy system and could help adapting to changing climatic conditions. New knowledge and more efficient and cost-competitive energy technologies, including their conventional and newly developed supply chains, are required for the long run. It is crucial that these new technologies show evidence of promising developments and do not represent a risk to society.
Scope:
One of the following technology-specific challenges has to be addressed:
New renewable energy technologies: Developing the new energy technologies that will form the backbone of the energy system by 2030 and 2050: Excluding wind energy and sustainable fuels addressed in the other bullet points, and photovoltaic new materials addressed in topic NMBP-17-2016 ('Advanced materials solutions and architectures for high efficiency solar energy harvesting') of the work programme part 'Leadership in enabling and industrial technologies – 5.ii Nanotechnologies, Advanced Materials, Biotechnology and Advanced Manufacturing and Processing', the challenge is to scale up energy technologies currently in development at laboratory scale. It is crucial that these new, more efficient, and cost-competitive energy generation and conversion technologies, demonstrate their potential value in the future European energy system. Developments in sectors other than energy may provide ideas, experiences, technology contributions, knowledge, new approaches, innovative materials and skills that are of relevance to the energy sector. Cross-fertilisation could offer mutually beneficial effects.
Wind energy: Improved understanding of the physics of wind as a primary resource and wind energy technology: For an improved design of large-scale wind rotors a better understanding of the underlying physics is needed. The challenge is to increase understanding of the underlying physics and to significantly improve the simulation capability for multi-scale wind flows, loads and materials failure. Significant high-performance computing (HPC) resources will be needed for this challenge. It is expected that further research towards this challenge will continue after the project, therefore the data retrieved in this project should be with open access. Research results could contribute to IEA Wind and for that reason cooperation with IEA partner countries is expected. International cooperation with leading groups outside Europe is encouraged. This research will contribute to making wind energy fully competitive, through a better design of the wind turbine and having an impact on the turbine efficiency and therefore on the cost of energy produced.
Sustainable Fuels: Diversification of renewable fuel production through novel conversion routes and novel fuels: Novel technologies for sustainable fuel production and novel fuels having a potential value in our future transport energy system should be developed at laboratory scale. The specific challenge is to diversify the sustainable fuel production taking into account long-term dependencies on fossil fuels of particular transport sectors by developing novel fuels and processes that in the long-term can bring down substantially transport fuel costs while overcoming sustainability constraints and feedstock limitations. While biofuels produced from starch, sugar and oil fractions of food/feed crops are excluded, this research shall enable novel fuel production addressing one of the following pathways:
Development of novel microorganisms, enzymes and catalysts or a combination of these systems with improved performance for obtaining paraffinic biofuels or higher alcohols from lignocellulosic biomass;
Development of renewable alternative fuels from CO2 in industrial waste flue gases through chemical catalytic conversion;
Development of renewable alternative fuels from H2O, CO2 and energy from renewable, autonomous sources through micro-organisms, synthetic molecular systems or chemical synthesis, or a combination of these processes;
Development of middle distillate range biofuels (i.e. diesel and jet fuel) from liquid organic or lignocellulosic waste streams through advanced thermochemical conversion processes.
Aside from the technology-specific challenges mentioned above, potential environmental, resource efficiency and safety concerns, issues related to social acceptance or resistance to new energy technologies, as well as related socioeconomic and livelihood issues also should be addressed, where relevant. This may require a multi-disciplinary perspective with contributions also from the social sciences and humanities, which then should be integrated into the research process from the outset. A methodology that permits a sustainability assessment of the environmental (notably in terms of GHG performance), as well as economic and social benefits with respect to current technologies should be included.
Novel technology solutions for grid integration, storage, fuel cells and hydrogen – other than integral to the technology solution developed, energy efficiency and smart cities will not be supported under this topic but in the relevant parts of this work program.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 2 to 4 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
The results of this research are expected to move the technology involved to TRL 4 (please see part G of the General Annexes) and to provide better scientific understanding and guidance enabling the players concerned (e.g. policy makers, regulatory authorities, industry, interest groups representing civil society) to frame strategic choices concerning future energy technologies and to integrate them in the future energy system. It is also expected that new, out-of-the-box or advanced innovative ideas will emerge that will provide new impetus to technology pathways, to new solutions, and to new contributions to the energy challenge in Europe or worldwide.
Where relevant, the new developed technology pathways should improve the economic, environmental and social benefits of renewable energy. Notably, for sustainable fuels they should improve the conversion efficiency that will eventually allow significant cost reduction.

","08 September 2020","Specific Challenge:
Driving is a complex activity. A hierarchy of skills is required for safe driving like operational (basic motor, sensory or perceptual), cognitive, tactical (choice of speed and distance from the other vehicles), and strategic (planning and preparing for long trips). Operational and sometimes cognitive skills typically decline for a variety of factors like ageing, chronic diseases, medication use, fatigue or a combination of these factors. The consequences of such decline on driver fitness are crucial for road safety and some countries already have procedures in place for assessing fitness to drive, nonetheless practical implementations and the assignment of responsibilities differ from country to country.
A driver’s fitness is also greatly affected by the consumption of psychoactive substances (illegal or not), which are incontrovertibly considered one of the major factors for traffic accidents. Establishing practical, reliable, specific and accurate tools for detecting those substances is of primary importance of the law enforcement authorities across EU, especially since their impact on road traffic accidents and associated injuries is undeniably important.
With the objective to further improve road safety, properly monitoring the driver’s fitness and physical state is an ongoing challenge that requires innovative techniques which go beyond existing regulations (e.g Regulation (EC) No 561/2006 - “the 'Driving Time Regulation”- or Regulation (EU) 165/2014 on tachographs in road transport).
Scope:
Develop and test in at least 3 different sites innovative technological solutions for evaluating a driver’s fitness. These should include for example:
Methods and practical solutions for evaluating driver’s performance and cognitive load, physical fatigue and reaction time. These solutions should go beyond the current state of the art and be suitable for roadside tests with particular focus on commercial drivers, whose working patterns could influence their driving performance. Transitional aspects with regard to automation should be considered and training actions for drivers should also be foreseen. Sex and gender differences should be considered when relevant. The proposed solutions should be interoperable and standardisation possibilities should be explored.
Develop efficient, reliable, cost-effective and socially acceptable solutions for detecting impairing psychoactive substances (e.g. alcohol, prescription medicines, illicit or medicinal drugs etc) for which driving under their influence poses a road safety risk. The proposed drug screening devices should fulfil practical and scientific requirements and display at least 20% higher sensitivity (how often the test is positive when the condition of interest is present) and specificity (how often the test is negative when the condition of interest is absent) than the current state of the art.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 3 to 3.5 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately.
Expected Impact:
Practical onsite or affordable screening devices that reliably measure the driver’s fitness and detect the existence of impairing substances.
Countermeasures to combat driving impaired by medicines or excess fatigue.
More consistent implementation across Member States of fitness to drive regulation and driver training, contributing to EU road safety targets.
Standardised solutions for evaluating fitness to drive.

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
The European Commission has launched a number of initiatives, studies, workshops and conferences on the challenges and effects that digitalisation and automation in transport may have on the labour force, including on women and persons with disabilities. In road transport, studies and research projects are starting to assess on the future employment needs and the new set of skills required for automation. However, such aspects need to be further explored for all modes of transport (road, waterborne, aviation, rail), as well as in the context of urban transport, logistics and for new forms of work (for instance platform work in transport).
In particular, action is needed to ensure the preparation of a comprehensive, evidence-based, action-oriented, appropriate agenda to tackle the identified challenges. This would also require the investigation of gaps and barriers, which could potentially impede or neutralise any positive effects expected from automation. For this purpose, in order to successfully address this challenge, it is key to have a strong involvement and engagement of all relevant European stakeholders, including European, national and regional social partners[1] (representing employers and workers) and EU Member States.
Attention should also be given to the collaboration with non-EU stakeholders where relevant, in order to solve common challenges, leverage resources, and establish long-term relationships.
Scope:
Proposals shall address all of the following areas:
Assess the impacts of automation and connectivity in all modes of transport on the labour market as a whole, focusing on both direct effects on the transport workforce and indirect / induced effects in other sectors.
Review past/contemporary experiences from other automation-driven transitions to derive best practices in the transfer of lessons learned between different environments and social contexts.
Review and analyse recommendations/contributions from past/ongoing related studies, activities and H2020 R&I projects. Identify and prioritise relevant targets and elaborate an action-oriented agenda aiming to achieve at least an overall neutral impact of automation at the level of the entire economy.
Activate the wider engagement of the social partners and EU Member States in order to validate the agenda, as well as increase their participation and involvement in the implementation of identified actions. Develop an appropriate framework to foster collaboration and exchange of best practices at EU, national and regional level.
Provide a forum for EU and international stakeholders (as appropriate) in this field to exchange experiences and knowledge on the effects of transport automation on the workforce and future skills and discuss future challenges. Organise conferences and workshops in this area.
Proposed actions should build on the knowledge and results of past and/or ongoing EU-funded projects (such as SKILLFUL), addressing the socio-economic impacts of automation in transport and/or undertaking related reviews of transport jobs and future skills requirements.
In line with the Union’s strategy for international cooperation in research and automation, international cooperation is encouraged. In particular, proposal should consider cooperation with projects or partners from Canada, Japan and the US.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 2 and 2.5 million would allow the specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
Demonstrate the expected impacts of automation and connectivity in all modes of transport on the labour market as a whole
Inform, mobilise and engage all relevant European stakeholders, including the European, national and regional social partners and EU Member States, in an active dialogue on the socio-economic effects of automation on the present and future transportation workforce
Minimise any potential negative effects of automation on the transport labour force

","19 September 2018","Specific Challenge:
Appropriate actions taken following a marine accident can greatly reduce loss of life or damage to the environment. This is particularly the case for very large passenger ships where flooding and maintenance of stability and systems that can safely evacuate large numbers of passengers (from a wide demographic within difficult conditions harsh environments and where there may be limited search and rescue capability) are critical. Despite improvements, fires on board passenger, roro and containerships continue to be a regular occurrence, which sometimes require external intervention for passenger and crew evacuation and on certain occasions could remain uncontrolled for days before being extinguished. Such interventions cannot be assured and are not always effective with consequent risk to personnel and the environment. The specific challenge is to develop solutions that address these risks and which can be reflected within forthcoming revisions of relevant IMO Rules. International cooperation to draw upon global experience and facilitate common positions that are founded upon joint research is considered particularly valuable.
Scope:
To address these challenges, proposals should address one of the following subtopics and clearly indicate which one they are addressing:
Subtopic A): To be implemented through Research and Innovation Action. Linked to a forthcoming revision of IMO rules and with a focus on passenger ships, research will address probabilistic damage and consequence safety assessment and actions to control damage and maximise stability following grounding and contact damage. The widest possible accident and design data from all relevant types of ship and damage should be sourced, processed, interpreted for passenger ships and used within probabilistic models. Retaining open access to data is encouraged. Consideration should be given to validation of such models through simulations and model tests. The optimisation of watertight doors in terms of their operation, their role as a watertight boundary and the risk they pose to personnel should also be considered.
Subtopic B): To be implemented through Research and Innovation Action. Research will address a radical re-think of evacuation systems for passenger ships having a high passenger capacity. Next generation of life saving systems should be developed that are ""deskilled"" to facilitate safe and swift operation on a damaged vessel within stressful environments and which are suitable for large numbers persons from a wide demographic range within poor or extreme weather conditions. Together technical solutions developed to TRL5 and their demonstration, social and behavioural aspects need to be considered.
Subtopic C): To be implemented through Innovation Action. With an emphasis on passenger and crew safety for all types of roro ships, research should address risk, design, ignition, detection, extinguishment, containment and regulatory issues so as to greatly enhance the prevention and management of fires at sea without recourse to external intervention. Solutions should be developed that are subject to experimental validation and demonstration and should include both operational and design risk control options. Special consideration needs to be given to fires originating within all types of roro decks.
Subtopic D): To be implemented through Innovation Action. With an emphasis on container vessels and crew safety, research should address risk, design, detection, firefighting and regulatory issues so as to greatly enhance the prevention and safe management of fires at sea without recourse to external intervention. Special attention should be given to fires occurring within the cargo area where relevant risk control options should be presented, analysed and the effects of their application validated though computer simulation and model test.
In line with the Union's strategy for international cooperation in research and innovation international cooperation is encouraged.[1]
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 7 and 12 million each would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
To TRL5, innovative technical solutions which significantly improve the safety of shipping will be developed and demonstrated. Activities will provide a technical basis and proposals for the revision of relevant international IMO safety rules. With respect to damage stability, establish a large body of evidence that can provide a sound basis for probabilistic models, free water effects and realistic procedures and systems to maintain stability sufficiently to enable safe evacuation within all reasonably foreseeable circumstances. Concerning evacuation, activities will develop and demonstrate a system that is intuitive, as far as possible automated and fail safe so that it is operable without significant training. The system must enable the timely safe evacuation of large numbers of persons from a wide demographic range in adverse conditions. Considering several recent on board fires, the developed solutions will enable similar on board fires to be detected swiftly and tackled safely without recourse to external intervention. International cooperation with important shipping nations will facilitate common science based understandings and a global approach to marine safety. Contribute to UN's Sustainable Development Goal 14 Conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas and marine resources and the target to prevent and significantly reduce marine pollution of all kinds.

","12 September 2019","Specific Challenge:
The road mobility environment – the area which covers both road transport users and those affected by them – is evolving. Vehicle types are beginning to change as a result of increasing levels of automation. New vehicle types and new types of road user will operate with conventional vehicles and road users as part of an evolving mixed traffic environment. Vulnerable road users are still a continued concern, and in the increasingly connected transport system ""vulnerability"" may in the future also be more related to the non-connected users and people unable to fully use the potential of the Information and Communications Technologies (ICT) services offered to mobility. Automated vehicles may enable occupants to be placed out of the traditional seating position (e.g. face to face or in lounge/office environments) while undertaking new activities, thus making them more vulnerable in normal traffic.
(Active and passive) safety systems will need to adapt to the future types of the potential collisions, occupant positioning taking into account possible differences between men and women and vulnerable road users of the future, and address the need to reduce minor and major injuries, as well as fatalities.
Scope:
The scope is to assure the development of robust solutions in the context of the changing environment, leading to dramatic improvements in transport users' and road workers' safety. In order to be properly addressed, traffic safety needs to be articulated in terms that are relevant for the connected and automated transport system.
To respond to the challenges proposals should address the following:
Define road safety characteristics and properties as conditions and constraints in a traffic system (including road workers) which is undergoing increasing automation and is highly dependent on software, positioning/navigation systems and connectivity. The concept of vulnerability should be given appropriate consideration and be viewed in the evolutionary context of the mobility system also addressing ""automotive digital divides"", e.g. between urban and rural areas. Future traffic changes and new traffic scenarios will need to be considered taking into account aspects such as severe weather conditions, poor road conditions. Updated ways to assess accident risks should be developed and also take into account injuries causing longer-term disability. A reduction of at least 10% (compared with 2016 figures) for road traffic casualties (fatalities, injuries and incidents -where known) should be demonstrated for the solutions developed within the chosen theme(s) below.
In addition at least one of the following themes should be addressed:
Development of tools and models which simulate how traffic scenarios are expected to change over time with the introduction of new vehicle types and new safety technologies for all road users. Human Body Models may need to be further developed to represent future collision scenarios (including pre-crash and near-crash behaviour) taking into account all road users. (such as gender, percentile, age, obesity, etc). Open source approaches are encouraged.
Design of (active/passive) protection systems for future collision scenarios as well as for occupants' variable body postures and different human body types in future interior concepts. These systems may require the further development of occupant monitoring functions and can make use of the sophisticated sensor systems which will be fitted to automated vehicles.
Development of (physical and/or digital) infrastructure and on-vehicle safety solutions as well as education and training schemes for all road users which match the pace of the increased implementation of automated driving functions.
The cultural diversity of road users should be considered, as well as age, gender and IT-experience.
In line with the Union’s strategy for international cooperation in research and innovation[1] international cooperation is encouraged.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU between EUR 4 and 8 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
A reduction of at least a 10% (with respect to 2016 figures) in injuries and fatalities in road accidents, contributing to the ambitions of the Transport White Paper’s goal to reach close to zero road fatalities by 2050. Contribution to the UN's Sustainable Development Goals (SDG), in particular goal 3.6 (""By 2020, halve the number of global deaths and injuries from road traffic accidents"") and SDG 11 (“Make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable”).
Innovative optimum protection systems enabling the occupants of automated vehicles to assume new seating positions and leverage the perceived benefits of automation. Solutions will contribute to industry competitiveness and EU leadership in road safety.
Harmonised and relevant methods for the assessment of safety solutions in both real-world conditions and in future mobility scenarios, e.g. based on virtual simulations with validated models and/or based on experimental results.
Safer use of vehicles, effective education and training schemes and increased awareness of all road users in the evolving road mobility environment.

","31 October 2017
","19 September 2018","Specific Challenge:
Human factors are the largest cause of accidents across all transport modes. Increased technical development and automation fundamentally change the way in which humans interact with the road or rail vehicles, vessels or aircraft and can improve safety by decreasing the human element. Evolving systems, operations and technology change how humans perceive their immediate environment and traffic as well as how they interact with the machine. However, machines are inherently less flexible than humans, who are, by their nature, variable in terms of behaviour, experience, cultural demographic, distraction, fatigue etc. Availability of sufficient relevant data on human factors needs to be secured. There is also a need for better methodologies to assess human factors which should be incorporated within risk based approaches to design and operation. In particular, human behaviour in ""normal situations"", in addition to accidents and incidents, should be assessed using real world data when available. Consideration also needs to be taken of demographic factors, including dynamics such as variations in safety perception and behaviour resulting from greater cultural and ethnic diversity in the EU.
The challenge is to improve transport safety through a more timely, focussed and integrated adoption of human factors in the design of road or rail vehicles, vessels or aircraft, infrastructure and the mobility system - taking advantage of automation - as well as increasing knowledge of enhanced human machine interactions to further advance the use of automation without introducing new, previously unknown, safety risks. More knowledge is needed on how automation changes human behaviour and the capability to react appropriately to fast emerging situations in a complex environment.
It is also necessary to understand and address bottlenecks in organisational acceptance of technological and social change. This includes emerging legal and regulatory issues associated with shifts in responsibility of the operator (driver, pilot, captain etc) as well as governance of complex integrated systems.
Cross-fertilisation of concepts and technologies across transport modes is encouraged.
Scope:
In order to meet this challenge, proposals should address one of the following sub-topics, and clearly indicate which subtopic is addressed:
Subtopic A): Understand the limitations, interaction and range of factors that influence and degrade human performance when controlling a vehicle/aircraft/vessel and apply solutions that overcome these limitations. Establish the conditions for a ""tolerance zone"" of acceptable operator performance and corresponding appropriate actions when the limits of safe behaviour are approached. The range of factors to be taken into account includes – but is not limited to - physical profile and ability, age, gender, linguistic and IT abilities, level of technical and non-technical skills, culture, and limitations faced by persons of reduced mobility (“PRM”). Carry out comparative behavioural and perceptive studies in different EU regions, and – within them – between different cultural and ethnic groups amongst transport users and operators, in order to understand diversity in perception of danger, comprehension of rules, mobility behaviour. Apply the knowledge in concepts and solutions. Methods and measures that support better adaptation skills in human behaviour, or provide intelligent support, may be considered. Define behavioural markers, including indicators of successful and degraded human performance. Develop recovery measures and mitigation solutions together with methods and techniques for measurement of changes in performance. Virtual concepts should be considered. Verify models and methods experimentally in relevant use cases. Activities should be aimed at identifying measures to increase understanding, respect and acceptance of transport safety rules. Furthermore the actions proposed should support the transfer of best practice within the EU and in neighbouring countries and ensure a better transport culture. Collaboration with neighbouring countries is recommended.
Subtopic B): Improve the assessment of human risk factors in risk based design and operation within waterborne / air transport, including crew resource management, crew awareness and response in extreme cases (e.g collision, evacuation, aircrafts upset recovery, runway excursions, etc). Identify new (and presently unknown) risk factors which might arise in the transformation towards increasing automation. Compile and analyse a large quantity of global real world accident, incident, near miss and other safety event data. Use this data to develop improved methodologies to address human factors within risk based comprehensive design models and operational safety assessment for waterborne and air transport. The data (if necessary anonymised) should be retained as an open source beyond the project, and be maintained and updated. Standardised guidelines should be developed for assessing and categorising human factors within investigations of accidents, incidents and near misses and other safety events. The resulting data should be easily incorporated into open data bases which can be a continued resource for risk based design and operations. Guidelines should be developed and, if necessary, recommendations to amend existing rules and regulation should be made.
Proposals should include methodologies or tools to demonstrate that they contribute significantly to safe transport systems through the knowledge created and also show how the measures identified adapt best practices to local conditions. Work should draw upon knowledge from other sectors-when addressing risk and interaction with complex systems. Development of enhanced Human Machine Interface solutions and simulators should take into account the advantages of automation. The cross-modal transfer of human factors issues within various levels of automation should also be considered. Proposals addressing air transport may include the commitment from the European Aviation Safety Agency to assist or to participate in the action.
In line with the strategy for EU international cooperation in research and innovation[(COM(2012)497, international cooperation is encouraged.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 4 and 8 million each would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
A significant step towards a safe transport system considering all transport modes, enabled by a decrease in collisions and incidents attributable to human factors by taking advantage of increasing automation in transport operation and control. Enhanced transport safety for a diverse demographic by increasing consideration of human factors within designs and transport operation means. Improved selection and training of operators. Enhanced international cooperation concerning human factors. Improved international rules and regulations. Facilitation of learning and safety improvement from assessment of human factors within accidents, incidents, near misses and other safety events, enabled through the provision of a long term human factors data resource. For road transport, actions will contribute to UN's Sustainable Development Goals 11 (Make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable) and 3.6 (By 2020, halve the number of global deaths and injuries from road traffic accidents). For aviation, actions will contribute to United Nations' International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO), EASA and FlightPath2050 goals to decrease fatality rates. For waterborne actions will contribute to IMO, EMSA, European maritime transport policy and UN Sustainable Development Goals 14 concerning the sustainable use of the seas and oceans.

","12 September 2019","Specific Challenge:
Although it is a means of transport that can reduce transport CO2 and air polluting emissions and significantly contribute to reducing congestion on European roads waterborne transport around European coasts and on its inland waterways remains under-utilised and is not fully integrated in the multimodal European Transport system. Both technical and administrative requirements hinder the take up of Intra-European waterborne transport. Improvements are needed concerning: efficient and seamless integration between transport modes and last mile connection, inland waterway bottlenecks, capacity of small ports, loading times, efficiency of transferring cargo between modes, cost effectiveness of partial cargo loads, environmental impacts and the feasibility of mixed passenger/freight services. There is a need to stimulate the modernization of intra-European waterborne transport as well as waterborne transport with neighbouring countries, particularly in the case of the outermost regions by fostering automation and digitisation so as to enable their more efficient and reliable participation in the whole supply chain, to reduce environmental impacts such as noise and to respond to changing freight flows and supporting full implementation of synchromodality within inland waterways.
Scope:
Proposals should focus either on area a) inland waterways or on area b) maritime transport. Proposals should clearly indicate which area they are covering.
To tackle this challenge, proposals should address the first bullet point (if they focus on the Maritime transport area), or the fourth bullet point (if they focus on the Inland Waterway Transport area), and in total at least five bullet points set out below:
• With a focus on the TEN-T network, develop to at least TRL5 one or more innovative inland waterway or short sea transport solutions incorporating innovative vessels which can operate more effectively within intermodal logistic chains with limited and affordable improvements to existing infrastructure. For example, solutions may combine freight with passenger services or ship to ship transfers so as to improve the cost effective feeding of freight from large to small inland ports. The role of smaller coastal ports, inland waterways and their urban waterfront, including those located in the outermost regions, should not be neglected as a means to exploit their high potential to contribute to innovative mobility solutions and last mile freight delivery.
• Solutions should address the entire business model including connectivity IT infrastructure and integration with other transport modes.
• Automated and connected inland waterway and/or port infrastructure should be addressed to enable more efficient operations. As appropriate, smart systems and automation should consider the automation of bridges, locks and dams, cargo handling and units, docking systems and shore side power. Digitisation, for example, EGNOS/Galileo services should facilitate efficient cross-border traffic and cargo information and ensure multi-modal interconnectivity and integration. The High Precision and Authenticated Positioning services of Galileo should be taken into account in optimizing the port operations.
• Proposals addressing inland waterways, should address solutions for infrastructure maintenance and operation that increase the network resilience as well as long-term reliable navigability forecast, and should ensure compatibility with existing and emerging harmonised cross border and intermodal traffic management systems.
• Environmental performance must be significantly improved compared to the current state of the art with regard to local air quality, noise, energy efficiency and risk of pollution. An environmental impact assessment and safety assessment of the developed solution in comparison to alternative forms of transport should be undertaken.
• Concepts should be proven, a cost-benefit analysis undertaken and experimental validation and demonstration should be undertaken where feasible.
• Dissemination, engagement and cooperation with logistics, shippers and intermodal transport operators are encouraged.
• Business cases should be developed for key routes including comparison with existing transport solutions.
• Recommendations should be made for optimising the conditions for intermodal solutions incorporating waterborne freight transport, including over shorter distances.
• Outcomes should be developed to a level which would be potentially suitable for deployment possibly with the support of CEF TEN-T, EIB loan, ESIF or other programme.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU between EUR 5 and 10 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
Decongest road and/or city infrastructure. Reduce the CO2 and air pollutant emissions of intra-European freight transport. Enhance the performance of the CEF TEN-T network. Substantially increase the amount of freight fed from intercontinental European ports using waterborne transport. Modernise, increase the reliability and competitiveness of Intra European Waterborne transport. Proposal should demonstrate that the deployment of solutions can increase the quantity of freight moved by Inland Waterways or Short Sea Shipping by at least 10% by 2030 compared to 2010 baseline data.

The implementation of bioeconomy solutions and related value chains on large scale depends heavily on the market acceptance of bio-based products. The fact that the price of bio-based products generally tends to be higher than the relevant fossil-based counterparts is still hindering the widespread take-up of these products. In addition to developing more features and better performance for the bio-based products and justifying a potentially premium price, the bio-based industry also needs to further increase consumers’ and brand owners’ awareness of the sustainability of bio-based products.
Whereas Topic BBI 2016.S31 set out to build a ‘think and do’ platform to increase mutual knowledge of possibilities and opportunities between producers and potential users of bio-based products, this topic focuses on involving brand owners and consumer representatives in the ‘targeting’ of bio-based value chains. The aim is to deliver products for relevant and necessary applications in consumer markets.
The specific challenge is to provide routes and means to increase cooperation and partnership between the different actors to achieve the market uptake of bio-based products. Industry should cooperate with brand owners and consumer representatives since they have a strategic role in better understanding market behaviours and needs. Meeting this challenge will also accelerate the crossing of the ‘valley of death’ from the research phase to commercialisation of a new product.
1 http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/portal/desktop/en/opportunities/h2020/topics/bbi-2016-s03.html
Scope:
Proposals should develop the structure and procedures for and implement the cooperation of the bio-based industry and brand owners and consumers to incorporate their knowledge and expertise on market changes and trends. The aim would be to increase market acceptance of bio-based products.
Proposals should seek complementarity with the projects funded under other topics1,2 to avoid overlap and promote synergies.
Proposals should also involve other stakeholders who could accelerate the marketability and public acceptance of bio-based products through new policies and strategies, for example local communities, local authorities, and other industrial actors.
The industry should actively participate to help prove the benefits of the project results to the full bio-based sector.
Work should also build upon existing standardisation documents and allow for the necessary pre-and co-normative research for the development of new standardisation documents and validated approaches, including B2B and B2C communication.
Indicative funding: It is considered that proposals requesting a contribution of maximally EUR 1 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately.

","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Brand owners are key stakeholders for implementing and accelerating the bio-based economy. As with any industrial investor, brand owners need harmonised legislation and stable policies to change business models and make investments.
Brand owners often perceive current market and regulatory situations as uncertain and are therefore reluctant to invest in a (new) bio-based product. These uncertainties relate to regulatory issues, feedstock quality and availability, results of life cycle assessments, bio-based product eco-design, functionalities and performance, standards, lack of knowledge, shortage of relevant skills, etc., and exist against the backdrop of consumers’ increasing sustainability expectations about products and applications. Local and regional success stories may help change this perception and instil confidence in brand owners so that they make the switch to bio-based products.
The specific challenge is to: (i) respond appropriately to brand owners’ perceptions of the potential risks of the ‘switching to bio-based’; (ii) identify advantages, incentives, motivations and best practices that may drive brand owners to switch; and (iii) provide frameworks able to incentivise, motivate and drive brand owners to ‘switch to bio-based’.
Scope:
Map and analyse major issues that brand owners qualify as high potential risks and cause their reluctance to invest in a ‘switch to bio-based’, and present efficient solutions to mitigate the potential risks.
Proposals should also identify and analyse incentives, motivations and best practices that may drive brand owners to ´switch to bio-based´. These incentives may include legislative frameworks, cost considerations, enhanced product performance or functionalities, public perceptions and consumer behaviour on ‘bio-based’ alternatives and megatrends, and impact on occupational health.
Proposals should focus on successful innovation ecosystems, as well as large brand owners’ companies that are already investing in bio-based alternatives, that could serve as examples or as value chain components for brand owners to switch to bio-based products and applications.
Proposals should include a variety of feedstock types and value chains and involve industry actors from relevant bio-based sectors. Proposals should deliver an effective ‘Switch-to-bio-based toolbox’.
Proposals should demonstrate and validate the added value of the developed ‘Switch-to-bio-based toolbox’ by at least one actual case of a switch from a fossil-based to a bio-based market application. This validation should include an assessment of the economic, social and environmental impacts.
Proposals may focus on specific value chains and relevant brand owners for successful consumer acceptance and applications of associated bio-based products. However, the proposed solution should be able to assist brand owners in any bio-based value chain.
Proposals need to include a clear and convincing communication, dissemination and exploitation plan to share the results with the bio-based industry at large, but also with the industry that has not yet made the ‘switch to bio-based’ and give effective advice.
The participation of organisations that could act as a link between the private sector (including brand owners) and the public sector (for example policy makers) is particularly encouraged.
The Bio-based Industries Consortium (BIC) will set up an industry and market expert group from among its members to provide expertise on the implementation and follow-up of the different tasks and help organise meetings. This expert group is not to be a part of the proposal, but will be offered to the project consortium to assist as needed. This expert group therefore should have an advisory role in the project but would not be a beneficiary in the consortium.
INDICATIVE FUNDING:
It is considered that proposals requesting a maximum of EUR 1 million and a planned duration of not more than two years would be able to address this specific challenge appropriately. However, this does not preclude the submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts or durations.
Expected Impact:
raise brand owners' interest in ‘switching to bio-based’;
increase brand owners’ involvement with and commitment to the bio-based industry;
increase marketability of ‘bio-based’ alternatives by fostering consumer awareness of the added value of bio-based products compared to fossil-based counterparts.

Not all actors in the bio-based sector may be aware of or familiar with the existing and emerging technologies that could be used in bio-based value chains. Moreover, technologies are continuously evolving, and new technologies emerge so frequently that industry can hardly keep up. Without a clear overview of relevant technologies for specific applications, selecting the right one(s) for a particular value chain becomes difficult.
Mapping these technologies in a user-friendly database could resolve this situation and provide toolboxes for various cases. Such a database should categorise each technology by its characteristics: application fields, feedstock (e.g. source, size, and composition), working principle (e.g. chemical, biotechnological, mechanical), maturity (TRL), energy consumption, maximum capacity (tonne/hr), application conditions (e.g. temperature, pH), combined use with other technologies, relevant engineering studies, etc.
It would also be relevant to include information on: (i) organisations that are active in the development and licensing of the technology; (ii) where laboratory/pilot facilities are available; (iii) capital and operational costs; (iv) competing technologies; etc.
The specific challenge is to provide a complete overview of relevant technologies for the bio-based industry, both existing and emerging.
Scope:
Explore and quantify the expressed needs of actors in the bio-based sector for a user-friendly database of relevant technologies categorised by area of application and meet these needs with a well-maintained database that is accessible to everybody.
The results of a first study on demand and feasibility will determine possible next steps. One possible next step could be the implementation of such a database if there is enough interest in it and if there is commitment to maintain the database. Another next step could be to carry out a feasibility study for other application areas (value chains), and possibly also for bio-based products.
Proposals must therefore determine the feasibility of such a database. They must also estimate costs and the time it will take to set up, launch and — in particular — maintain it once the project has ended for a period of at least 10 years. Proposals must include a governance structure to maintain the database and keep it up to date by adding new information and correcting the database as new developments of technologies proceed.
This topic focuses in particular on industrial actors who are searching for new and innovative technologies that could improve their processes or enable new processes. But the scope also includes the providers of technologies and the research and technology-transfer communities. The research and technology-transfer communities should supply the database with the latest technologies and other relevant features. Proposals will ensure that both the ‘users’ and the ‘suppliers’ of the database help to maintain the database once it is operational.
Possible areas of application for the database include: biomass-feedstock preparation including pre-treatment; different conversion technologies (biotechnological, chemical, physicochemical, mechanical, etc.); downstream processing; and product formulation. The technologies for specific desired outcomes may differ for the various possible value chains. For example, they may use different feedstocks or different states of reactants.
This topic calls for proposals limiting the study to one ‘type’ of biomass feedstock that is based on either agricultural sources, forestry, marine/aquatic, food processing waste, or bio-waste. The result of this project will determine possible next steps for other types of biomass.
A similar system for just one sector, the food-processing sector, has been developed and could serve as inspiration for proposals under this topic [1].
Proposals are encouraged to use artificial intelligence as appropriate to accelerate the exploration and quantification of the needs in the selected value chain.
INDICATIVE FUNDING:
It is considered that proposals requesting a maximum of EUR 1 million and for a planned duration of not more than 2 years would be able to address this specific challenge appropriately. However, this does not preclude the submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts or for other durations.

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Microorganisms and/or enzymes can be applied to biodegrade/decompose plastic waste, one of the major threats to our ecosystem. This is a key focus area to apply the concept of the circular economy, besides changing human behaviour and production systems. The plastics industry is increasingly applying eco-design principles when producing plastics, ensuring an appropriate end of life by recycling, degrading or composting. Where these principles cannot be applied (any more), industry needs to establish different systems to close the circle of plastic material in the end-of-life phase. This will avoid plastic littering land and sea and reduce plastic waste diverted to landfill or incineration. Scientists have recently found that some microbes (bacteria and fungi) have evolved the ability to break down plastics1. Other scientists have discovered plastic-eating bacteria that can break down PET2 .
Applying microorganisms and/or enzymes in the end-of-life phase of plastics could result in new feedstock for the bio-based industry. They may even be applied to all sorts of residual streams without any preliminary separation or sorting operations.
The specific challenge is to exploit the potential of microorganisms and/or enzymes to resolve end-oflife issues with plastics.

2 See: https://www.sciencealert.com/new-plastic-munching-bacteria-could-fuel-a-recycling-revolution; see also: See for example European Biotechnology – winter edition – vol. 16 2017, page 54.
Scope:
Select and apply the appropriate microorganisms and/or enzymes to address one or both of the following issues:
▪ convert waste streams containing non-biodegradable polymers;
▪ remove non-biodegradable polymers from the environment.
Proposals may include tailored microorganisms and/or enzymes for co-digestion or co-fermentation of different feedstock, provided that the developed solutions result in sufficient yields in terms of: (i) breaking down the feedstock; and/or (ii) conversion into valuable products.
Proposals should address all requirements for RIA as shown in Table 3 in the Introduction of the Annual Work plan 2019 .
The technology readiness level (TRL) at the end of the project should be 4-5 for the bio-based value chain in question. Proposals should clearly state the starting and end TRLs of the key technology or technologies targeted in the project.
Industry participation in the project would be considered as an added value because it can play a supportive role to demonstrate the potential for integrating the developed concepts and technologies into current industrial landscapes or existing plants so they can be deployed more quickly and scaled up to apply industry-wide.
INDICATIVE FUNDING:
It is considered that proposals requesting a contribution of between EUR 2 million and EUR 5 million would be able to address this specific challenge appropriately. However, this does not preclude the submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
EXPECTED IMPACTS LINKED TO BBI JU KPIS:
▪ contribute to KPI 1 – create at least one new cross-sector interconnection in the bio-based economy;
▪ contribute to KPI 2 – set the basis for at least one new bio-based value chain;
▪ contribute to KPI 8 – validate at least one new and improved processing technology reflecting the ‘TRL gain’ since the start of the project.
ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS:
▪ decrease the amount of non-biodegradable polymers sent to disposal or even discharged to the environment;
▪ in case the focus is on the removal of non-biodegradable polymers from the environment, contribute to ‘close the loop’ and thus reduce environmental impacts associated with nonbiodegradable polymers discarded in the environment;
▪ enlarge the range of feedstock able to be effectively and sustainably processed through biocatalytic systems.
ECONOMIC IMPACTS:
▪ lay the basis to the further exploitation at higher scales of microorganisms and/or enzymes to convert currently challenging streams;

","single-stage
Deadline date","Scope:
Specific challenge: Economic activities in Europe' seas and coasts are expected to intensify, diversify and expand further offshore driven by the competition for space on coastal areas and the increased exploitation of marine (renewable) energy, biological and mineral resources in the deep sea.
The development of large scale activities offshore and in deep sea areas requires overcoming a series of technological and operational challenges related to, among others, surface support facilities, control systems, fluid and solid transport or remotely operated robots/vehicles. Economic considerations are also central in the expansion of the Blue growth sectors. This is why there is a need to assess the most promising and sustainable business models and identify the corresponding technological and environmental challenges to allow these offshore developments to happen. Finally non-technological challenges such as grid connections, conflicts for use of the marine space and licensing in the context of marine spatial planning, must also be taken into account. One way to make use of our seas in a smarter, more sustainable and potentially less disruptive manner is to combine different, complementary and synergistic activities at sea at the same location (e.g. energy production and storage,  fisheries and aquaculture, transport & logistics hubs, observation and monitoring), with multi-use offshore platforms. There is a need to review the work undertaken in this area to assess related business models.
Scope:  Proposals should analyse and identify the social and economic developments in the offshore economy and the most promising, environmentally sustainable and economically feasible business models. This should include a review of marine renewable energy farms (both wind and ocean energy), offshore aquaculture facilities, multi-use offshore platforms projects[1] and their business models, as well as issues of competing access to marine space between different activities and, more broadly, all social and environmental impacts (including impacts on coastal areas). Proposals should also set-up a mechanism associating key stakeholders interested in the development of the Blue Economy, with a view to covering all the following objectives:
identify the technological, challenges to be overcome to make these business models operational and define a shared research and technology agenda
investigate solutions to overcome the non-technological challenges such as the infrastructure and grid development within the  relevant EU legislative framework ( in particular the maritime spatial planning and existing coastal and planning systems)
propose large scale pilot initiative(s) to be launched in European seas which should demonstrate the feasibility of the most promising business models.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU in the range of EUR 2 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected impact:
Prepare the ground for demonstration activities of most promising offshore business models;
Significantly increase investments by the key European level maritime stakeholders (industrial, scientific communities) in the offshore economy;
Support the EU Blue Growth and maritime spatial planning policy objectives.

Specific challenge: If we consider the vast reservoir of enzymes identified through the latest large-scale marine genomics and metagenomic sequencing projects, the potential to unveil novel interesting enzymes from marine sources remains very high. However, this potential does not automatically guarantee novel commercial products. The challenge at hand is posed by both current limitations in screening and expression technologies as well as by issues of property rights and intellectual property. Both are still limiting factors that require further attention.
Scope: Proposals should address the development and demonstration of innovative technologies for high throughput enzyme screening and/or for the expression of marine enzymes and proteins through dedicated hosts and should focus on respective key research challenges including purification systems and upscaling of the marine enzymes. Screening should take into account industrial technical specifications of the enzymes of interest. Win-win academic and industry cooperation and/or agreements on issues related to property rights and intellectual property should be considered in order to maximise the exploitation potential.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU in the range of EUR 6 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Our future is intimately linked to the future of the seas, oceans and coasts. The seas, oceans and coasts provide multiple ecosystem services and a wealth of resources, influence climate and provide many economic opportunities. To fully profit from the seas and oceans also in the future, we have to preserve those valuable resources and ensure that their exploitation is sustainable. Furthermore, without appropriate ocean observations for forecasting and for the protection of property and human activities, the global economy would lose hundreds of billions of euros annually. For this, we need to have the technologies for observations, integrated ocean observing systems, data management systems, and appropriate models and services. This action will contribute to make ocean observations and data management in European seas and the Atlantic Ocean fit for the future, in line with the G7 Future of the Oceans Initiative (Tsukuba Communiqué of the G7 Science Ministers[1]). It will also support the Collaborative Research Action on Oceans of the Belmont Forum[2] and the International Ocean Governance Communication[3]. Similarly, ocean observation data must be available to effectively address local, national and global challenges such as the forecasting of ocean conditions and climate change, to take stock of biomass and biodiversity, to mitigate the impact of climate change and ocean acidification, to ensure food security and food safety (also in fresh water), and to contribute to the UN 2030 Sustainable Development Agenda, notably UN SDGs 2, 13, 14 and 15, and monitoring their targets for 2020 and 2025.
Scope:
Proposals shall address one of the following sub-topics: blue cloud services, or ocean observations and forecasting[4], or technologies for observations (in 2020). Actions shall demonstrate integration, capacity and (scientific, economic etc) potential. They shall complement and build on existing observation tools and systems such as EuroGOOS/EOOS, IOOS, GEO/GEOSS, COPERNICUS Marine Service or EMODnet, European research infrastructures such as Euro-Argo ERIC and EMSO ERIC as well as funded H2020 projects such as SeaDataCloud[5]. The interdisciplinary and cross-sectorial nature of the proposal should also apply to training activities improving the professional skills and competencies of workers and supporting the creation of new jobs in the blue economy.
[A] 2019 - Blue Cloud services
Activities shall develop cloud services for applications that are specific for oceans, seas and fresh water bodies and are necessary for marine ecosystems research, conservation, forecasting and innovation in the Blue Economy, building and implementing also Blue Cloud demonstrators as needed. Blue Cloud demonstrators should integrate the Essential Ocean Variables[4], notably the biological variables, including plankton biomass and diversity. They shall build on ongoing efforts (data, tools, EOSC, including its Pilot Blue Cloud, Data and Information Access Services (DIAS) of COPERNICUS, etc) and take account of the parallel EOSC thematic initiatives being developed – such as the Food Cloud Demonstrator.[5] The action shall contribute to unlocking the innovation potential of the Blue Cloud, and demonstrate its potential in promoting the blue economy shortening the time span between research and innovation in frontier fields, such as micro-organisms and genomics-enabled innovations[8]. Activities shall build on existing research infrastructures, take advantage of existing data sharing activities (for example EMODnet), and build on relevant results of past and on-going global, national and EU projects such as SeaDataCloud[9], BlueBridge, the EOSC Pilot and other relevant projects funded under Horizon 2020, including those under Information and Communication Technologies[10]. Proposals should include a task to cluster with other projects financed under this topic and – if possible – with other relevant projects in the field funded by Horizon 2020.
[B] 2019 - Observations and forecasting
The action shall contribute to the development and demonstration of the feasibility of the European component of a future Global Ocean Observing System in line with the G7 Tsukuba Communiqué[4]. It will support activities in the different EU sea basins and the Atlantic Ocean, including the deep sea (below 2000 m), also supporting the needs of food security and safety as outlined in Food 2030[5]. It will also support the future Collaborative Research Action on Oceans of the Belmont Forum[8]. It will underpin forecasting of the state of the ocean, climate change impact and weather. Activities shall include the demonstration of methods and technologies and their integration in existing systems to collect information on the state and variability of European seas and the Atlantic Ocean, including the impact of stressors and marine litter, and underpin sustainable management of the marine environment and its resources (e.g. the effect of networks of protected areas and other spatial protection measures). They shall take account of the needs deriving from the G7 Future of the Seas and Oceans Initiative[9], from actions such as the Atlantic Ocean Research Alliance and its related South Atlantic Flagship, the BLUEMED Initiative, and notably common priorities with the WestMED Initiative[10]and the EUSAIR[16], and actions addressing other European regional seas. The inclusion of forecasting tools (for example to protect aquaculture installations or to inform fisheries decision making) shall be an advantage. Similarly, the sustainability of the approach selected, the integration of innovative observations solutions and existing systems, the smooth storage of data in open access data centres and the improvement of the predictive capability shall be demonstrated. Observations and data handling may also include pilots for Essential Ocean Variables (EOVs)[17] under consideration (for example, nutrients, carbonate, sound and microbes/omics) and variables that are of importance in European regional seas as well as the integration of “augmented” observatories (i.e. genomic-enabled multidisciplinary observatories)[18]. Flow of information across variables and disciplines shall be included. Data collected shall be in line with agreed standards, be openly available via portals (including EMODnet) and feed into the Pilot Blue Cloud (part of the European Open Science Cloud). International cooperation with Third Country partners is encouraged.
Proposals shall include a task to cluster with other projects financed under this topic and – if possible – with other relevant projects in the field funded by Horizon 2020. Possible links with related research and innovation activities supported by the Belmont Forum[19] on Ocean sustainability shall also be considered.
[C] 2020 - Technologies for observations
Proposals shall address i) the demonstration of new and innovative technologies to measure the Essential Ocean Variables (EOV) at all depths, and ii) sensors to measure variables for aquaculture, fisheries, micro and nanoplastics, and marine litter and micro-litter, iii) the demonstration of novel approaches to observe the ocean with multiple underwater, surface, and air vehicles (surface and air vehicles are optional, but underwater must always be included) with a view to realizing the digital ocean. Optional air vehicles could potentially, among others, contribute to the development of fully documented fisheries.
Sensors should measure in-situ biogeochemical and biological EOVs and may include new or emerging EOVs (possibly defined at OceanObs19[20] or those needed for MSFD Descriptors) as well as technologies needed for “augmented” observatories (i.e. genome-enabled multidisciplinary observatories) to allow deeper investigation of marine biology and ecology and as sites to test the new technology. Demonstrations to advance deep sea oceanography, notably biological oceanography, by combinations of fleets of gliders, fixed stations, research vessels, etc. should reach TRL 6 or higher. Proposals may also cover the standards, protocols and communications needed for the observations, for open access to data, standards for data management and communication. Activities to transfer technologies from other sectors (for example combinations with data from satellites) will also be considered. The proposals shall also address issues such as low-power, miniaturisation, modularity, interoperability and low-cost. The proposals shall take agreed standards (for example Open Geospatial Consortium standards) into account. The development of new vehicles or other platforms are excluded from this call. Data collected (except data for testing) must be prepared in line with commonly agreed standards and be made available in a form suitable for EMODnet and clouds.
This topic is in support of the European Strategy for Plastics in a Circular Economy. Selected projects under this topic as well as projects selected under other topics in H2020 supporting the Plastics Strategy are strongly encouraged to participate in joint activities as appropriate. These joint activities could take the form of clustering of projects, participation in workshops, common exploitation and dissemination etc. The projects should describe how they will be complementary with already existing relevant national activities or other multilateral activities funded by the EU or funded jointly by several Member States. The proposals are expected to demonstrate support to common coordination and dissemination activities. Therefore, the proposals should foresee a dedicated work package for this purpose and earmark appropriate resources. Further details of these coordination activities will be defined during the grant preparation phase with the Commission.
Please note that this topic is part of the lump sum funding pilot scheme. Funding for grants awarded under this topic will take the form of lump sums as defined in Commission Decision C(2017)7151 of 27 October 2017. Details of the lump sum funding pilot scheme are published on the Funding and Tender Portal together with the specific Model Grant Agreement for Lump Sums applicable.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU in the range of EUR 6 million for sub-topic [A], EUR 12 million for sub-topic [B] and EUR 9 million for sub-topic [C] would allow this specific challenge to be adequately addressed. Nonetheless, this does not preclude the submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.

","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Existing bio-based industries and value chains have emerged often independently from each other. As a consequence, each has its own terminology in describing process parameters and properties of raw materials and products. This disparity in terminology and in standards hampers the integration of actors across sectors and hence the creation of new value chains. In addition, in spite of progress made by the European Committee for Standardisation (CEN) in the development of a coherent and harmonised standardisation frame for bio-based products, there is still a need to spread the use of the developed standards with a view to capitalise on their market pull potential. This calls for cooperation on the international level, especially with industrialised countries, e.g. by exchange of Best Practices and experiences in order to reach more coherent approach to bio-based products globally. Regulations governing the use of biomass in the various application sectors differ among the sectors and between the EU and the national levels. This may deter industries from investing in new facilities and even in research and innovation towards new products and applications. The specific challenge is twofold:
To boost the use of instruments, in particular common standards, reducing barriers to trade in bio-based products among value chains and across the EU and hence expand their market potential.
To address regulatory hurdles across sectors hindering investments into existing and new value chains, products and applications as well as the establishment of a level playing field for bio-based products.
Scope:
Proposals should address the following elements:
An evaluation of existing standards and regulations across the sectors and value chains, in order to identify conflicts and barriers to growth and to propose simple and applicable alternatives that facilitate investments in new value chains and products and increase the market uptake of bio-based products and processes.
Analysis of EU, national and regional legislation, to identify legislative barriers that hamper integration of actors across sectors and value chains in their efforts to establish new value chains utilising biomass in a cascaded manner. Special attention should be given to legislation governing the industrial use of biomass, for example waste legislation. The analysis should also identify Best Practices in removing legislative barriers in the process towards a bioeconomy.
Supporting the CEN work (TC411 and other Technical Committees) to optimise the industrial applicability and use of the developed standards in order to further specify bio-based products characteristics and communication thereof for the various application sectors. These will be of significant help in B2B and B2C communication.
Build on and coordinate with other, on-going projects that address the same topic of standards and legislation, in particular those of Horizon 2020's Societal Challenge 2: Food security, sustainable agriculture and forestry, marine and maritime and inland water research and the bioeconomy.
Address needed regulations updates to reflect relevant new technological developments.
It is considered that proposals with a total eligible budget of up to EUR 1 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals with another budget.
Expected Impact:
Contribute to more coherent policy environment, better interrelations between regional, national, EU and global bioeconomy policies.
Contribute to the removal of barriers to investments to grow towards a bioeconomy, for example link to waste legislation.
Specific proposals to amend existing regulations or for new regulations to promote the factual cooperation in joint projects by actors across sectors and value chains.
Concrete support of CEN TC411 to improve horizontal aspects for better integration across boundaries.
New standards providing increased commonality between different bio-based industrial sectors
Commonly agreed vocabulary throughout value chains, from feedstock suppliers to biorefining to downstream actors in the application sectors.
Increased use of standards and labels with positive long-term effects on the overall development of the European bio-based products market.

","11 June 2015","Scope:
Specific Challenge:The North Atlantic is a key marine region that encompasses ecologically and biologically important and fragile ecosystems (e.g. deep cold-water corals) and provides goods and services essential for our well-being such as regulating climate. Furthermore, a decade long international investment in instrumenting and quantifying the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation provides a robust foundation upon which large process studies can be built to study the biogeochemistry and biodiversity that controls growth at the base of the ocean food web. Such studies can inform a mechanistic understanding of element and energy flow in the system, which are important to modeling, predicting future changes in such things as ocean atmosphere feedback loops and sustainable yields for fisheries. The exploitation of aquatic living resources in the North Atlantic has been a key driver for growth and wealth creation in several coastal areas. However, the biodiversity and functioning of this fragile environment as well as the products and services they provide are currently under threat. Addressing these pressures cost-effectively, requires a strengthened knowledge base, improved innovation and predictive capacity and the development of adaptive management plans for sustainable exploitation and use of the marine resources.
Scope: Proposals should fill in knowledge gaps to deepen the understanding of the biogeographic patterns, biodiversity, biogeochemistry and ecosystem services and goods supported by different marine ecosystems at ocean basin and management relevant scales and the capacity to model, understand and predict shifts in the dynamics of North Atlantic ecosystems, thereby supporting preservation and unlocking the potential for the sustainable production of new products and industrial applications. Decision support tools and methodologies should be developed to support adaptive (ecosystem based) management approaches enabling good governance of the North Atlantic marine ecosystem by the bordering countries so as to secure the sustainable exploitation of the living resources whilst ensuring its preservation. The work may draw upon related research expertise that has been developed within other sea basins. Proposals should also develop genuinely cross-disciplinary, integrated, systemic approaches – including the socio-economic dimension, as well as the engagement of the broader stakeholder communities. In line with the objectives of the EU strategy for international cooperation in research and innovation (COM(2012) 497), proposals should contribute to implementing the Transatlantic Research Alliance, launched by the Galway Statement[1] on Atlantic Ocean Cooperation in May 2013, and should benefit from the inclusion of partners from the United States of America and Canada[2]. Cooperation is also encouraged with other international partners.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU in the range of EUR 8–12 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected impact:
Improve resources management (ecosystem approach) and governance to preserve them and unlock their potential for the sustainable production of the new products and industrial applications.
Improve cooperation among EU Member States with respect to Atlantic ecosystem based research as well as with International partner countries
Contribute to the implementation of the EU Integrated Maritime Policy, its environmental pillar the Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD), The Common Fisheries policy (CFP), the EU 'Maritime Strategy for the Atlantic Ocean Area'[3], and the Galway Statement on Atlantic Ocean Cooperation.

Enhancing the awareness of the broad public on bio-based products and applications and their benefits is essential for the public acceptance and the success of a bioeconomy. This requires a comprehensive and continuing communication programme with ‘science-based’ facts and figures and well-formulated key messages, which address capabilities and benefits as well as risk management of (new) bio-based products. The specific challenge is to communicate at the right moments, with the appropriate key messages on what bio-based products are and can be used for, their benefits for man and environment and the role of the bio-based industries, while also addressing the concerns of the society. This communication programme needs to closely cooperate with communications programmes within H2020 on bio-based products and to Regional activities addressing the same to achieve synergy.
Scope:
Develop well-formulated, science-based facts and figures on bio-based products, key messages on benefits and risk management, addressing societal concerns. Develop case studies on practical solutions for end-users and involve organisations representing the society at large. A communication programme utilising the appropriate key messages for the target audiences should also include a feedback loop to incorporate citizens reactions and for continuous improvement of the programme. Other key messages should include the benefits of a bioeconomy, and the contributions the bio-based industries bring to communities at large in terms of jobs and economic growth, of welfare and wealth. Proposals should address the following elements:
Case studies on specific practical solutions for end-consumers that cater to societal needs or concerns.
Consultations with the involved stakeholders in order to ensure that the developed ‘common language’ for communicating across value chains is meaningful and will be accepted by the broader stakeholders’ communities.
Produce tailored communication tools, including workshops, conferences and exhibitions for the respective target audiences to maximise outreach and facilitate debate.
Carry out market surveys to measure progress in consumers’ engagement, market-uptake of bio-based products, public acceptance of the socio-economic and environmental benefits of bio-based industries. Survey results should be used to adapt priorities and communication key messages.
Increase public confidence by providing clear information on the performance, (comparative) functionality and end-of-life options of bio-based products.
Develop together with societal and research organisations and in cooperation with educational organisations teaching materials for use in educational systems at various levels (primary, secondary, vocational, university) across the EU.
Explore possibilities for synergy with regional activities and EU initiatives (e.g. European Innovation Partnerships) that address similar needs.
Build on and coordinate with ongoing Horizon 2020 projects dealing with communication and public consultation in the field of bio-based productsa communication programme to overcome the lack of information on bio-based products and to mobilise engagement and raise awareness among citizens and various stakeholder groups.
It is considered that proposals with a total eligible budget of up to EUR 1 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals with another budget.

","Coordination and support action
","27 October 2015
","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
The Mediterranean Sea is going through rapid changes in response to closely interlinked natural and anthropogenic pressures. Climate change influences its physical dynamics and hydrological structure, while nutrient and pollutant loads are flowing from growing urban areas, land and coastal activities. Increasing maritime traffic also leads to safety concerns, potential pollution and the introduction of invasive alien species. Fishing remains unsustainable. The area's marine heritage and its ecosystem services are also at risk. In addition, the geo-political complexity of the area adds further difficulties related to the establishment of favourable framework conditions to support the growth of a blue economy (e.g. in trans-border cooperation on sea-related activities, including maritime spatial planning). Within this frame, coordinated and integrated action needs to be carried out by Member States individually and among Member States together in order to create synergies and complementarities between sectors and countries. This is to provide added value to regional, national and EU investments, remove barriers, avoid duplication and reduce fragmentation, and was put forward in the Vision Statement of the 'Research and Innovation Initiative for Blue Jobs and Growth in the Mediterranean Area – The BLUEMED Initiative'[1]. This initiative and its related Strategic Research and Innovation Agenda will contribute to achieving a healthier, more productive, resilient, better known and valued Mediterranean Sea. In addition, a common marine and maritime R&I strategy needs to be further consolidated in order for it to be possible to achieve solid knowledge-based sustainable and long lasting 'Blue Growth' in the region[2].
Scope:
This action is expected to contribute to the implementation of 'The BLUEMED Initiative' vision with its related Strategic Research and Innovation Agenda and Implementation Plan. This calls for the further alignment and convergence of national research and innovation activities and other relevant initiatives and investments with the different actors and across different sectors in primis between the European countries bordering the Mediterranean Sea coasts and the whole EU. In this context, proposals should establish and consolidate an operational network of marine and maritime research funders and other key players. Proposals should support the design and implementation of new transnational joint activities, by using the most suitable and effective collaboration methods and tools. These new activities should focus on the key challenges and other relevant issues identified in the BLUEMED Strategic Research and Innovation Agenda (SRIA) and related Implementation Plan, namely support for technology development, promotion of multidisciplinary research and an innovation-enabling environment, improving human and research infrastructures and capacities, creating a fully integrated observing and forecasting system, promoting citizen awareness and literacy on marine issues, and improving training. This action should build on past and ongoing regional, national and EU projects (e.g. SEASera ERA-NET, PERSEUS COCONET, ESFRI research infrastructures EMBRC, Euro-Argo, ICOS, EMSO etc.) and initiatives. It should integrate research, policy, industry (including aquaculture) and society (including the preservation of local coastal cultures). It should also contribute to pooling different funding streams, at national and EU level, and combine them in an effective way. Lastly, it should create the conditions for extending the initiative to the Southern Mediterranean coastal countries. Support for related events organised under the auspices of the Presidency of the Council of the European Union should be envisaged.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of up to EUR 3 million and a foreseen duration of four years would allow this challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude the submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts or durations.
Projects funded under this topic will by default participate in the Pilot on Open Research Data in Horizon 2020, with the option to opt-out, as described in the introduction.
Expected Impact:
To contribute to the implementation of the BLUEMED Initiative's vision, its related Strategic Research and Innovation Agenda and Implementation Plan, proposals must:
Make the Mediterranean Sea healthier, more productive, resilient, better known and valued.
Boost the knowledge base and contribute to creating the right conditions for developing new technologies and services and for improving human and infrastructure capacity in the Mediterranean region.
Boost the 'blue economy' and contribute to creating more jobs in the Mediterranean region.
Increase the competitiveness of EU researchers, industry and SMEs within the marine and maritime sectors.
Improve the coordination and alignment of national marine and maritime research programmes.
Maximise the impact of national and EU-funded marine and maritime research.
Contribute to the implementation of the EU Integrated Maritime Policy, its environmental pillar the Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD), the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) and the Communication 'Blue Growth - opportunities for marine and maritime sustainable growth'.
Improve the professional skills and competences of those working and being trained to work within the blue economy.

","29 September 2016","Specific Challenge:
Automated vehicles will be accepted by customers and society only when they will be deemed easy-to-use and fully reliable and safe regarding the planned manoeuvres and their execution. A key challenge is to ensure safe vehicles handling with reduced driver attention. Especially for level 3 automated driving systems an effective interaction between the driver and the automated vehicle plays an important role. To act in harmony with driver expectations, these systems should be engineered following a user-centric approach. User acceptance is particularly important for the design of, driver interfaces that will facilitate the transitions between human and automated driving. Moreover, the automated driving systems should be resilient to both system and driver failures and guarantee sufficient reliability and robustness in each and every situation in real world traffic. The introduction of automated vehicles into the existing traffic poses specific issues regarding safety, in particular during the transition period where there will be interactions with other vehicles (of any degree of automation or none) and other traffic participants such as pedestrians or cyclists.
Scope:
Proposals for research and innovation activities should address one or several of the following domains:
―Analyse user requirements, expectations and concerns (e.g. interaction with the system, trust, liability, privacy concerns, security, minimum safety and performance standards, etc.) related to the use of automated driving systems.
―Design safe human-machine interface and driver monitoring strategies to maximise the intuitiveness and situation awareness; enable safe and appropriate driver take over strategies; monitor drivers’ behaviour, predict drivers’ actions, and increase drivers’ acceptance.
―Safety of automated driving in mixed traffic situations. Develop fail-safe/fault tolerant systems and solutions for highly reliable and safe operations of automated vehicles in any kind of complex and mixed traffic situations in the transition period, also including safe interactions with all different road users and difficult weather conditions.
Gender issues are particularly relevant and disaggregated data collection and analysis is strongly recommended.
In line with the Union's strategy for international cooperation in research and innovation[1], international cooperation is encouraged. In particular, proposals should foresee twinning with entities participating in projects funded by US DOT[2] to exchange knowledge and experience and exploit synergies.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 3 to 6 million each would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
Actions are expected to develop safe automated driving systems which are fully in line with user expectations, easy-to-use and allow an effective interaction between the driver and the automated vehicle. These automated driving systems will be resilient to both system and driver failures and guarantee sufficient reliability and robustness in mixed traffic situations. Actions will provide significant contributions in the following areas:
―Reducing the number of accidents caused by human errors, such as inattention and distraction. Research will therefore help to achieve the European policy objective of halving road deaths by 2020, and, in the longer term, the Transport White Paper ""Vision Zero"" objective by preventing road accidents caused by human errors.
―Maintaining the leadership position in developing user-centric, safe and reliable vehicle automation systems by the European vehicle manufacturers and their suppliers.
―Proper validation procedures for automated driving systems to assess and test functional safety and performance.
―Integrating user requirements, expectations and concerns related to the use of automated driving systems.

","27 September 2017","Specific Challenge:
Fully automated road transport systems have the potential to revolutionise urban transport offering high quality public transport services which are not feasible with conventional public transport systems. Low speed full automation systems have been demonstrated in several European cities. However full-scale demonstrations are still necessary to prove the reliability, safety and robustness of fully automated road transport systems in complex scenarios in urban areas. In addition, it is necessary to address the remaining questions, such as user acceptance and legal framework and to develop business cases to make fully automated urban road transport systems economically viable.
Scope:
Proposals should demonstrate fully automated road transport systems which should be complementary to mass transit to reach low to medium demand areas with high quality transport services. A fleet of automated road transport vehicles (e.g. light weight vehicles, cyber cars, small buses) should be implemented at pan-European level in urban and/or sub-urban areas. The demonstrated systems should be fully integrated into existing public transport systems and should provide evidence of their safety, reliability and fault tolerance in complex traffic scenarios (with automated and non-automated vehicles, pedestrians, cyclists, powered two-wheelers, etc.) as well as on potential benefits in terms of impact on climate-change and the environment.
Proposed actions should assess the user acceptance and effects on transport demand and modal transfer. Attention should also be paid to the analysis of socio-economic impacts and benefits of urban automated vehicle fleets as part of an integrated transport system, such as improved accessibility of persons with reduced mobility, elderly, etc. Gender specificities should be considered. Recommendations for local and national authorities to deploy fully automated road vehicles should be developed.
Active participation of SMEs is strongly encouraged.
In line with the Union's strategy for international cooperation in research and innovation[1], international cooperation is encouraged. In particular, proposals should foresee twinning with entities participating in projects funded by US DOT[2] to exchange knowledge and experience and exploit synergies.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 10 to 15 million each would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
Actions are expected to demonstrate the reliability, safety and robustness of fully automated road transport systems in complex scenarios in urban areas. They should develop innovative solutions for the safe and smooth integration of automated vehicles into the existing transport system in urban areas, as well as door-to-door public transport services, which can change radically the mobility paradigm of European cities. Therefore, actions will contribute to the development of modern, more efficient urban transport systems, with reduced impacts on climate change, air pollution, noise, health and accidents. Moreover, actions will provide detailed knowledge and recommendations which enable transport authorities, policy makers and business to invest in urban automated vehicle systems and support the development of innovative mobility services (e.g. car sharing, road train systems, etc.).

Ensuring that research and innovation in bio-based products and processes is not only excellent, but also relevant and responsive to the needs of all actors is important, not least in ensuring the uptake of results. Surveys show that consumers and citizens in general have little awareness and knowledge of bio-based products (BBP). To improve market uptake of bio-based products, shape future research in BBP science, technology and innovation and meet the views and expectations of society, there is a need for a broad, inclusive assessment of the challenges and opportunities at hand.
Multi-actor approaches are needed to identify and address both the risks and different stakeholders' interests and aspirations, in order to maximise the benefits of new bio-based business models within society. Mobilisation of all actors along the value chain is crucial to mitigate the probability of ""technology mismatches"" (i.e. development of technologies without a corresponding reliable and cost-efficient feedstock supply, or which face insufficient market demand).
Scope:
The Mobilisation and Mutual Learning Action Plan (MML) should ensure the engagement of all relevant groups and tackle innovation related challenges by establishing a multi-stakeholder platform, gathering a plurality of actors with different perspectives, knowledge and experiences[1], and maintaining open dialogue between the different stakeholders.
The objective of the platform should be the development and implementation of an Action Plan that would address the challenges of raising awareness of and engaging with the citizens on the bio-based products. Proposals have to be based on and develop the concept of Mobilisation & Mutual Learning Platforms (MML). The design of this platform and its activities should take into account and build on methods developed previously in European projects and initiatives (including consultation processes in the field of bio-based products).
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of up to EUR 3 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude the submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
The direct and sustainable impact of proposals will be:
to create networks of specific target groups in order to raise citizens' awareness and understanding of bio-based products;
to create a better framework for new bio-based market opportunities, through broad stakeholder engagement leading to responsible, reliable, and societally acceptable solutions;
to contribute to responsible policy-making, helping to shape further research on bio-based products and improving acceptability of existing bio-based products.

","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Bio-catalysis enables transformation of starting biomass into bio-based products, often with higher selectivity and catalytic efficiency as well as requiring milder operational conditions versus chemical routes. Nevertheless, to establish industrial standards of bio-catalysis, microbial genomes need deep modulation to boost naturally occurring chemical reactions or induce new reactions that are of industrial interest.
The continuity of bio-based production, needed to increase the overall economic sustainability, is hindered by the drawbacks associated with the use of living microorganisms. Along with the quite long residence times often required and the limited suitable pH-ranges, the tendency of such microorganisms to accumulate mutations leads to a genetic drift which negatively impacts the production stability. In order to increase the industrial bio-catalysis production cycle, there is a need of microorganisms that maintain their bio-catalytic characteristics for longer period of time (meaning higher generation number). Also, further research is required to mitigate the impact of environmental microbial flora that may negatively affect the bio-production in terms of yield and/or quality of the products.
Scope:
Improve the techniques for microbial construction and control, leading to an intensification of microbial bio-catalysis for the converting biomass into bio-based chemicals and avoiding the use of chemical additives in the production cycle in order to limit the environmental impact of the process. Proposal should also prove significant improvements in at least two of these aspects:
Optimisation of the kinetics of the conversion process.
Extension of the suitable pH-range.
Maximisation of the yield of the biotransformation diminishing side-products /inhibitors that have a negative impact on subsequent process.
Through these activities, proposals should provide new robust strains with higher production yield for longer production cycle, as well as relevant improvements in the market value of by-products and side-streams. In particular, compliance with regulatory framework and commercial requirements of the valuable streams coming from the process must be validated and demonstrated.
Proposals should also assess the feasibility of scale-up and replication of the developed solutions into a wide range of bio-catalytic processes. This should allow for a better and broader application of the innovative techniques, with the aim of replacing current microbial strains within the value chains based on bio-catalysis. In addition, proposals should prove high levels of safety and sustainability, from technical, economic and environmental points of view, required for a feasible scale-up towards demonstration levels.
The projects should cover any Technology Readiness Level (TRL) from 3 to 5. In the case of a pilot scale project (TRL 5), proposals should also present a credible cost estimate for the proposed processes with a preliminary assessment of their competitiveness when scaled up.
Proposals should also include an environmental and socio-economic assessment, for example with an LCA. In particular, when targeting TRL 5, proposals should include an LCA in order to evaluate the environmental and socio-economic performance of the developed processes.
It is considered that proposals with a total eligible budget in the range of EUR 2-5 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals with another budget.
Expected Impact:

","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
During the last two decades major progress was made in terms of industrial applications of biotechnology. Relevant national and FP7 research programmes and projects in the Biotechnology area have significantly contributed to improve European economic and environmental protection. Innovation in biotechnology also provides opportunities to transform the global economy from an extensive dependence on fossil raw material to a sustainable “bio-economy”.
However, economic indicators suggest a need for urgent action to maintain Europe’s global lead in biotechnology. In order to increase the competitiveness of EU industries, broader and deeper collaboration across relevant sectors and Member States is necessary. It will also be necessary to better use research advances in areas such as systems and synthetic biology for applications and demonstration in industrial biotechnology.
Scope:
Proposals should gather a critical number of relevant programme managers and funders in the field, and implement a joint transnational call for proposals (resulting in grants to third parties) with EU co-funding, focusing on Technology Readiness Levels in the range of 3 to 6. They should build on the previous success of ERA-IB-2, ERASysAPP, ERASynBio under FP7, allowing for the seamless integration of the areas covered, together with the bioinformatics area and be complementary to related health initiatives. The ultimate aim is to speed-up research and innovation in industrial biotechnology, establishing systems biology and synthetic biology as technology drivers while focusing on downstream industrial applications. The significant involvement of industry in the activities developed up to the exploitation of results will be an important element to achieve this goal. Extensive communication activities should foster the European leadership role in advanced biotechnological research and innovation.
The proposals will address Social Sciences and Humanities (SSH) elements, in particular for outreach activities and in terms of the public perception of biotechnologies for industrial uses.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU between EUR 8 and 10 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
No more than one action will be funded.
Expected Impact:
Better align current EU and national biotechnology initiatives with the goals of the KET Biotechnology area under Horizon 2020, in particular by focusing on application-oriented research and demonstration activities and by developing a European Biotechnology hub, acting as a facilitator and multiplier in this regard.
Improved use of synergies and coherence of current research funding activities in particular through the launch of calls for proposals and the use of existing research infrastructures (e.g. bioinformatics).
Increase the financial commitment of participating countries and additional private sector resources compared to the three previous ERA-NET projects.
Increase the visibility of the potential benefits of a bio-based economy for the society, in particular through dissemination and exploitation of results.

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
As bio-based intermediates are becoming more mature, and entering new markets, one of the major hurdles to develop new bio-based solutions is the lack of adequate knowledge of the bio-based industries of the applications; and vice-versa the unawareness of down-stream industries of those new materials. Cross-sectorial exchanges and joint development are therefore essential to imagine tomorrow’s products and solutions.
Scope:
Structure the exchange of bio-based industries and downstream sectors in an open-innovation process. The proposal should focus on the establishment and facilitation of the operations of an open-innovation platform looking at:
Build prospective on the development of bio-based products markets in collaboration with downstream sectors and brand owners (for sectors like packaging, automotive, construction, textile, personal care and cosmetics, etc.).
Assemble an ecosystem of private companies along the bio-based value chain (including first, second transformation and downstream industry) and public organisations.
Foster exchanges within the Open-innovation platform ecosystem to better understand market and societal needs and opportunities for bio-based products development.
Facilitate the emergence of co-innovation partnerships across industries, value chains, and scientific fields, in order to develop new bio-based solutions for tomorrow’s societal needs.
Such operations should include:
Manage a network of academic, technological and prospective experts to further the open-innovation platform vision and perform prospective studies on upcoming technologies and downstream markets.
Create and manage online communities of interest to bring together ideas within and across the value chains, and transform ideas into innovation projects, hand-in-hand with partners.
Create a Knowledge and Innovation Centre, respecting confidentiality, collecting the prospective and insight of the community to provide high added-value content and tools to inform the co-innovation partnerships.
Organise specific events and workshops to dig deeper into bio-based industries prospective studies and to develop networking opportunities in view of generating co-innovation projects.
The Bio-based Industries Consortium (BIC) will set up an industry expert group from among its members which will provide expertise in the implementation and follow-up of the different tasks and also provide support to the organisation of meetings or workshops. This expert group should be a central part of the governance structure of the project.
Indicative funding: It is considered that proposals with a total eligible budget of up to EUR 1 million EUR would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals with another budget.
Expected Impact:
An efficient collaborative and common platform, bringing together the professionals and scientific experts around bio-based products development and downstream applications, building a common vision and prospective of the challenge ahead.
A Knowledge and Innovation Centre, with a web platform, accompanying scientist and economic operators in the development of new solutions suited to the markets current and future needs.

","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Biorefinery operations, processing specific types of biomass feedstock, yield a wide variety of products and fractions for further valorisation to applications such as food, feed and materials. However, existing pre-treatment steps often result in relatively high concentrations of impurities and inhibitors, impeding high yields of the desired products. In the case of fermentation processes, for example, downstream processing steps for separation and purification could easily amount to about 80% of the total fermentation costs.
Ongoing developments towards process intensification of the total plant operation in other industrial sectors offer interesting opportunities for the bio-based industry. For example, in the petrochemical, pharmaceutical and food processing industries, process intensification has led to re-sizing, higher efficiencies and safer operations with significant cost reductions1. Similarly, process intensification could lower the costs of bio-based operations, including conversion and downstream processing.
The specific challenge is to improve biorefinery operations by applying process intensification concepts to lower operational costs, increase operational safety and achieve high yields of the desired products.
1 See for example: D. Reay, C. Ramshaw, A. Harvey. Process Intensification: Engineering for Efficiency, Sustainability and Flexibility. Butterworth-Heinemann (2013).
Scope:
Develop and evaluate process intensification steps and schemes for an integrated lignocellulosic biorefinery to lower capital and operational costs for safely achieving high yields of desired products.
When addressing the in situ recovery of targeted products, proposals should focus on technologies that will also enable the removal of highly reactive products and should consider a range of products including liquid and gaseous products.
Proposals should address all requirements for RIA as shown in Table 3 of the Annual Work plan 2019.
The technology readiness level (TRL) at the end of the project should be 4-5 for the bio-based value chain in question. Proposals should clearly state the starting and end TRLs of the key technology or technologies targeted in the project.
Industry participation in the project would be considered as an added value because it can play a supportive role to demonstrate the potential for integrating the developed concepts and technologies into current industrial landscapes or existing plants so they can be deployed more quickly and scaled up to apply industry-wide.
Indicative funding:
It is considered that proposals requesting a contribution of between EUR 2 million and EUR 5 million would be able to address this specific challenge appropriately. However, this does not preclude the submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.

","04 April 2019
","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Use of synthetic, fossil-based pesticides in the agriculture sector is under pressure. Consumer and environmental considerations have resulted in an increasing number of regulations limiting their applications. Moreover, increasing resistance to pesticides by various pests and diseases limits their commercial life-span. As a result, availability of efficient chemical solutions to certain agricultural pests is dwindling. These developments are threatening current and future agricultural production levels.
Bio-based solutions such as bio-based pesticides have the potential to decrease inputs of synthetic pesticides in the agricultural sector, while providing high yields in terms of pests’ control. However, having a higher selectivity than currently used pesticides, they would require the combination of different solutions in integrated pest management approaches to obtain the total desired results. Also, extensive testing needs to prove they meet all requirements regarding risks, toxicity and pathogenicity. These factors have been holding back a wide use so far.
On the other hand, one of the biggest challenges of agriculture is to guarantee high crop yields and productivity, while matching increasingly stringent environmental regulations dealing with the agricultural sector. Moreover, the increasing world population and the related increased demand for sustainable food production systems are boosting the expansion of agricultural practices also in currently un- or under-exploited lands. Thus, the optimal use of such new arable lands calls for environmentally friendly products for plant health enhancement, such as biostimulants able to foster plant growth without ‘overloading’ the environment with potentially harmful chemical inputs.
The specific challenge is to apply sustainable solutions for effective pest control and/or biostimulation enabling a sustainable increase of agricultural productivity.
Scope:
Demonstrate effective production and application of bio-based pesticides and/or biostimulant agents to maintain and increase agricultural productivity.
Proposals may address both bio-based pesticides and biostimulants and in so doing can show complementarity and synergy between the two in an integrated approach.
In case proposals address only biostimulants, proposals should target products based on bioactives extracted/derived from bio-based feedstock.
This topic includes any bio-based feedstock, provided it can be sourced in a way that is sustainable both from an environmental and an economic perspective.
Proposals that target actives/molecules from bio-based feedstock should include: (i) the sourcing and chemical characterisation of the base feedstock; (ii) the separation and purification of the desired compounds; and (iii) the optimal and safe production of the standardised final products.
Proposals should include an experimental validation stage, assessing the effect of the developed products or microorganisms on the targeted crop(s). Proposals should also compare the effects of the developed products when applied to the same crop and to the relevant soil types and growing conditions. In this test work, the performance of the products or microorganisms developed should be demonstrated, in terms of, for example, their tolerance to abiotic stress, their water uptake, nutrient assimilation and overall crop quality of the crop (in the case of biostimulants), and/or resistance to pests and diseases (in the case of bio-based pesticides).
Proposals should provide evidence of the test results.
Proposals should address all requirements for IA - demonstration actions as shown in Table 3 of the Annual Work Plan 2019.
The technology readiness level (TRL) at the end of the project should be 6-7. Proposals should clearly state the starting and end TRLs of the key technology or technologies targeted in the project.
Indicative funding:
It is considered that proposals requesting a maximum contribution of EUR 7 million would be able to address this specific challenge appropriately. However, this does not preclude the submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
Expected impacts linked to BBI JU KPIs:
contribute to KPI 1 – create at least one new cross-sector inter­connection in the bio-based economy;

Extremophilic microorganisms can survive and perform under extreme conditions of temperature (thermophiles and psychrophiles), pressure (barophiles), pH (acidophiles, alkalophiles), salinity (halophiles) or a combination of these (complex extremo­philes). The potential role of this kind of microorganisms in biotechnological and industrial applications is increasingly attracting attention. The utilisation of extremophilic microorganisms and/or of related extremophilic enzymes can support a significant increase in process performance by widening operational conditions and developing new processes and/or products. Moreover, it can enable the treatment of (residual) streams featuring extreme conditions that currently cannot be processed or require expensive pre-treatments.
The specific challenge is to develop sustainable processes in a wider range of operating conditions (pressure, temperature, acidity, etc.) by using extremophilic microorganisms and/or related enzymes to convert biomass into valuable components at high process yields. Successfully carrying out such processes at pilot scale can provide insight into the potential for these microorganisms at an industrial scale.
Scope:
Validate at pilot scale in an industrially relevant environment innovative processes that use extremophiles or extremozymes for the efficient conversion of biomass into useable chemical building blocks.
Proposals should address one or all of the following items:
adaptation and selection of naturally occurring extremophiles;
engineering of organisms to suit extreme working conditions or achieve specific performance targets;
identification of specific extremozymes with high industrial potential for increasing process yields.
The industry should actively participate to prove the potential for integrating the developed concepts into current industrial landscapes or existing plants so that deployment of the concepts can be accelerated and scaled up to an industrial level.
Proposals should specifically demonstrate the benefits versus the state-of-the-art and existing technologies. This could be done by providing evidence of new processing solutions and new products obtained.
The Technology Readiness Level (TRL)1 at the end of the project should be 52. Proposals should clearly state the starting TRL. The proposed work should enable the technology to achieve TRL 5 within the timeframe of the project.
Proposals should include an environmental assessment using Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) methodologies, and a cost analysis. Proposals should also include a viability performance check of the developed process(es) based on available standards, certification, accepted and validated approaches.
Proposals should seek complementarity with the projects funded under earlier topics (and in other programmes) to avoid overlap and promote synergies.
Indicative funding: It is considered that proposals requesting a contribution of EUR 2 million to maximally EUR 5 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude the submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Coordination and support actions (CSAs) funded by the 6th and 7th Framework Programmes1, Horizon 2020 including the BBI JU, various Interreg2 and other European programmes have addressed many aspects related to the bio-based industry. These include: standardisation; awareness and communication; identifying regulatory hurdles; technological and non-technological road-mapping; foresight and market studies; biomass availability; sustainability; and analysing bio-based industries in Member States and regions. Current CSAs continue to address similar and different aspects to help the bio-based industry.
However, there is no ‘global overview’ of the results of completed work, the objectives of ongoing actions or a gap analysis versus long-term objectives. Moreover, these results and analyses are not collected or made available centrally for use in follow-up and future work. More needs to be done to communicate these results to the relevant stakeholders and a wider public.
The specific challenge of this topic is to benefit from the results from previous projects and from ongoing actions in the bio-based industry at the regional, national and European levels.
1 See BIO-TIC integrated roadmap as an example: http://www.industrialbiotech-europe.eu/new/wpcontent/uploads/2015/08/BIO-TIC-roadmap.pdf
2 A series of programmes since 1989 to stimulate cooperation between regions in the EU, funded by the European Regional Development Fund.
Scope:
Map the (completed and running) CSA projects of all European programmes during the past ten years that address non-technological aspects for a bio-based industry in Europe.
Proposals should interlink the CSA projects where relevant, showing how they can work together and build on each other’s strengths.
Proposals should collect the results from studies and projects that address the bio-based industry, especially those funded under the BBI JU programme, displayed in a transparent, readily available and user-friendly fashion to facilitate their use in future work and communication activities.
Proposals should also identify what more needs to be done by different stakeholders (policy-makers, business, investors, the scientific community and others) to ensure a sustainable, strong and competitive bio-based industry in Europe, including the successful development of new markets for bio-based products and applications. The recommendations given in the BBI JU Interim evaluation report1 have to be taken into consideration as well.
This exercise should not be limited to pinpointing issues to address relating to legislation, standards, legal or fiscal policies, end-users’ concerns, etc., in a single sector or application area. It should also address the bio-based industry in its broad sense, looking especially at long-term EU-added value and job creation potentials, as presented in the BIC SIRA. It should also address possible business cases to stimulate and expand private investment in the bio-based industry. Analysing and presenting these issues in an industry-led CSA within the BBI framework will provide the basis for a comprehensive set of proposals from an industry perspective.
Proposals should include provision for dialogue with different stakeholders, including the scientific community, investors, trade unions and civil society, and ways should be found to reflect diverging views in the project results. Proposals should contain a communication plan to share the results of the project throughout Europe.
Proposals should lead the way towards creating a Europe-wide network of bio-based expertise that can play a significant role in setting strategic guidelines for the bio-based industry in Europe, feeding and tapping into related Member State and associated country strategies. This will position Europe as the leader in building a society where economic growth is decoupled from resource depletion and environmental impact.
The indicative length of time needed to achieve these objectives is approximately one year. This will involve delivering results at the latest in May 2020, so that hurdles can be addressed in the AWP 2020.
The Bio-based Industries Consortium (BIC) will set up an industry expert group from among its members to provide expertise in the implementation and follow-up of the different tasks and help organise meetings. This expert group should have an advisory role in the project, but as such is not a beneficiary in the consortium.

It is considered that proposals requesting a maximum of EUR 250 000 and a planned duration of not more than one year would be able to address this specific challenge appropriately. However, this does not preclude the submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts or durations.

","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
The implementation of bio-based value chains on large scale, fed by a diversified feedstock portfolio, requires effective supply chains able to reduce biomass losses, limit costs and enhance the overall sustainability of the value chains.
Biomass suppliers and technology providers need to jointly provide significant improvements in logistical issues such as biomass supply, collection, storage and the preparatory steps towards biorefining. Introducing and/or increasing the application of information and communications technology (ICT) and tools could provide the desired efficiency improvements. These tools are already playing a role in forestry1 and this experience could serve as example for the bio-based industry supply chain.
Applying ICT will also provide links with ‘the internet of things’ and Industry 4.0 (the current trend for automation and data exchange in manufacturing technologies). Efficiency gains will result in the creation of sustainable value chains.
The specific challenge is to identify opportunities for the introduction of ICT to increase the efficiency and sustainability of biomass supply chains for the bio-based industry. Sustainable feedstock supply chains will permit the creation of sustainable bio-based value chains, which could serve as engines for the economic development of rural areas.
See http://www.focusnet.eu/
Scope:
Identify feasible opportunities for ICT to improve the efficiency and sustainability of supply chains through cooperation between biomass suppliers and technology providers.
Proposals should cover several supply chains handling different kinds of biomass coming from multiple sources. Proposals should include a description of the (combined) feedstock and its potential for sustainable value chains.
Proposals should also assess the efficiency and sustainability improvements of logistical supply chains by applying the proposed ICT solutions, including also biomass resource modelling.
Proposals should also address the assembly and financing of new and technically improved equipment possibly required to collect and store feedstock for the bio-based industry, in the short time window after harvesting.
The industry should actively participate to help prove the benefits of the project results to the full bio-based sector.
Indicative funding: It is considered that proposals requesting a contribution of maximally EUR 1 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately.
Expected Impact:
contribute to KPI 1: create at least 2 new cross-sector interconnections in bio-based economy clusters;
reduced biomass losses and costs associated with feedstock supply logistics compared with similar existing benchmark supply chains;
improved direct involvement and commitment of biomass suppliers and technology providers, and the resulting introduction of ICT in the biomass feedstock supply chain for the bio-based industry.

","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
The level of activities of the Bio-based Industries Consortium (BIC) is not balanced throughout Europe. This is particularly the case in 'moderate/modest innovator' countries according to the European Innovation Scoreboard1. This may be the result of insufficient knowledge of the potential for the bio-based industry in these countries, by actors in bio-based activities in these countries as well as by BIC. Additionally, actors in these countries may not be fully aware of the opportunities offered by BIC and the Bio-based Industries Initiative.
In order to explore how to remediate this situation, BIC has started in 2017 a pilot study in Portugal, Romania and Poland, identifying opportunities to expand the bio-based industry into these countries on a sustainable basis. This pilot study includes mapping local biomass sources that potentially could be used as sustainable feedstock for the bio-based industry, and mapping the major actors in the various relevant sectors. Additionally, the study sets up an action plan that seeks to establish interest and commitment from the actors and governmental institutions in the countries for expanding their industrial bio-based activities. BIC will continue this work in 2018 for Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania.
Similar work needs to be done in other countries, building on the ongoing work.
The specific challenge of this topic is to increase bio-based industrial activities in countries where these activities are relatively low2.
1 http://ec.europa.eu/growth/industry/innovation/facts-figures/scoreboards_en
2 See also the SC2 topic RUR-09-2018 Realising the potential of regional and local bio-based economies.
Scope:
Map the available and potential biomass feedstock, actors and opportunities for industrial bio-based activities in selected countries, and specify an action plan to arouse interest and commitment from local actors to increase and/or create the bio-based activities in their respective countries.
The scope of this topic is fully in line with current EU policies and the Bioeconomy Strategy. It covers all local biomass sources that could serve as feedstock for bio-based industrial activities in an integrated fashion with the food chain, and do not cause indirect land use change nor any damage to the ecosystems.
The scope also covers all major actors (biomass providers and processors) in the respective countries who could help advance sustainable bio-based activities and investments in their countries.
Proposals should target five (5) countries from the following list, with a justification of the selection: Albania, Bulgaria, Bosnia Herzegovina, Croatia, Czech Republic, Greece, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Montenegro, Serbia, Slovakia, Slovenia and Hungary.
Proposals should build on the work completed by BIC for Portugal, Romania and Poland in 2017 and the subsequent action plans1.
The Bio-based Industries Consortium (BIC) will set up an industry expert group from among its members to provide expertise in the implementation and follow-up of the different tasks and help organise meetings. This expert group should have an advisory role in the project, but as such is not a beneficiary in the consortium.
Indicative funding:
It is considered that proposals requesting a maximum of EUR 750 000 and a planned duration of not more than one year would be able to address this specific challenge appropriately. However, this does not preclude the submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
1 The final reports will be available on http://biconsortium.eu.
Expected Impact:
concrete opportunities to expand and/or create industrial bio-based activities in the selected countries;
first-pass indication of benefits to the local economies, environment and society by establishing industrial bio-based activities in the targeted countries.

Specific challenge:
Over the last ten years, the Commission has become increasingly active in the field of Conflict Prevention and Peace Building (CPPB). This involvement is likely to further increase over the years to come and a more extensive use of the articles 42 to 46 on the Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP) of the Treaty on European Union.
Scope:
Projects under this proposal should:
review current understanding and training relating to conflict prevention and peace building in order to take into account current practice, including the effect of outsourcing of some security work, and the potential divergences in understandings; and
develop new training methods in the field of civilian conflict prevention and peace building such as: conflict prevention, mediation, Security System Reform (SSR), Linking Relief, Rehabilitation and Development (LRRD), anti-corruption, early warning systems, etc.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between €1m and €2m would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected impact:
New training curricula for enhancing the preparedness and skills of personnel for conflict prevention and peace keeping missions especially in high risk countries. Thus contributing to more efficient and effective conflict prevention and peace keeping missions. Ultimately, this should reduce the costs of such missions, whilst at the same time contribute to a more efficient implementation of the CSDP.

Specific challenge:
Border control relies on a number of presumed abilities in those performing it. These include the ability to:
         stay alert from the beginning of a shift to the end;
         distinguish truth from falsity;
         detect malicious intent;
         detect invalid or falsified documents;
         detect hidden goods or humans in vehicles;
         detect behavioural indicators of persons engaged in, or methods used to undertake, illicit activity;
         compare and agree a match or non match between the facial image in the passport with the face of the traveler, irrespective of ethnic background, age difference or normality in the passport image.
Scope:
Studies show that in the long term perspective, the task of border management to facilitate legitimate border crossings, while detecting and preventing illicit activities will remain a critical capability, given the expected rising cross-border flows. Border control is likely to face increasing demands for efficiency, which implies a need for technical systems that are user friendly and reliable in operational conditions.
The project should list and carefully analyze the psychological factors which may affect the performance of key border guard tasks and also include a review of the psychological literature relevant to such task.
It should suggest remedies and a strategy for improving performance. The research should help to identify which tasks related to border control could be carried out in a more automated manner, and for which tasks the human factor is indispensable.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between €2m and €5m would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected impact:
This research should make a major contribution in improving the effectiveness of EU border control. It will contribute to the implementation of the Smart borders initiative (and future regulation), reinforcing checks while speeding up border crossing for regular travellers, optimizing procedures and enhancing the security at the moment of the crossing of the EU external borders.
The action is expected to proactively target the needs and requirements of users, such as border management decision-makers, border guards and citizens (regular travellers).

","11 April 2018
","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
The worldwide demand for protein is progressively expanding due to strong growth in the world’s population. Improvements in the standard of living in large parts of the world are adding to the protein demand1. Forecasts to 2050 show that current protein availability will not be sufficient to meet protein demand for food purposes. At the same time, Europe is highly dependent on imports of protein-rich material for feeding livestock: About 70 % of the total amount required is imported. Already 60-70 % of global arable land is used for animal feed to meet animal protein demand.
Consequently, the exploitation of new protein sources is necessary to meet the worldwide demand. European crops, together with residues and co-products from primary biomass cultivation, are valuable sources of proteins. Residues from animal processing, fisheries, aquaculture and algae industries also offer a potential, albeit currently underexploited, source of proteins. The bio-based industry could help to expand the production of protein-rich ingredients by valorising existing alternative sources from food/feed value chains and by taking full advantage of the successes of earlier (and ongoing) R&D and small-scale industrial operations2.
The specific challenge is to increase the availability of sustainable, safe proteins sourced from alternative, sustainable sources.
1 http://www.fao.org/docrep/013/i2050e/i2050e.pdf
2 Two projects on algae biorefineries have been selected in Call 2016 of Horizon 2020 Societal Challenge 2: Genialg (http://cordis.europa.eu/project/rcn/206026_en.html) and Sabana (http://cordis.europa.eu/project/rcn/205995_en.html)
Scope:
Successfully operate a large-scale, first-of-its-kind bio-based value chain producing sustainable, safe food- and/or feed-grade proteins sourced from alternative, sustainable sources, such as residual streams from agriculture, other biomass production and related residual streams (like aquaculture, fisheries, or seaweed), or food industry side streams, through a cascading approach where applicable1.
Proposals should include the whole value chain from the feedstock supply to processing and production steps for the targeted high added-value products. All relevant technologies in the different steps are applicable, provided they have been already proven at a significant scale (preferably demonstration levels TRLs 6-7, but at least pilot plant level TRL 5).
Proposals should focus primarily on proteins for food and feed applications. However, proposals could also consider functional proteins and other applications that may make it possible to generate new incomes and hence increase the overall sustainability of the value chains. Proposals should include extra valorisation steps through an integrated biorefinery setup.
Proposals should address the elimination of hurdles and bottlenecks regarding the logistics, transport modes and associated infrastructure in the targeted biomass feedstock supply systems. These include collection systems, intermediate storage and safety aspects.
Proposals need to take into account legislative limitations over the origin of the biomass feedstock when dealing with proteins for human or livestock nutrition. Proposals should include an assessment on safety, quality and purity for the target products, comparing them with the current (imported) proteins used for the same applications and end-products.
Proposals should also provide sound business case and business plan showing that sustainably produced feedstock streams are available in Europe, allowing to increase protein production in Europe and to reduce the imports of protein-rich products.
Proposals should specifically demonstrate the benefits versus the state-of-the-art and existing technologies. This could be done by providing evidence of new processing solutions and new products obtained. Proposals should demonstrate the techno-economic feasibility of the large-scale deployment of sustainable and efficient European value chains for proteins production.
Proposals should include a full assessment of the environmental, economic and social impacts of the developed products or processes, using LCSA methodologies based on available standards, certification, accepted and validated approaches (see also introduction – section 2.2.5 - published in the BBI JU AWP 2018).
Any potential hazards associated with the developed processes and products should be analysed to ensure that the products comply fully with REACH2legislation and other toxicity requirements, safety requirements and any relevant EU legislation.
If relevant, proposals should also allow for pre- and co-normative research necessary for developing the needed product quality standards.
The technology readiness level (TRL)3 at the end of the project should be 8. Proposals should clearly state the starting TRL. The proposed work should enable the technology to achieve TRL 8 within the timeframe of the project.
Indicative funding:
It is considered that proposals requesting a maximum contribution of EUR 21 million would be able to address this specific challenge appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude the submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Arctic permafrost contains twice as much carbon as the atmosphere, stored in the upper metres of the ground. Thawing of permafrost may trigger the release of this carbon and its transformation to greenhouse gases, reinforcing global warming (permafrost carbon feedback). Moreover, permafrost coasts make up 34% of the world's coasts. Increasing sea-level in combination with changing sea-ice cover and permafrost thawing expose these coastal areas to higher risks. Knowledge gaps exist in relation to the transfer of material - including organic matter - from land to sea and its fate, with the consequence that processes of accumulation and/or subsea permafrost degradation are not accounted for in global climate and Earth system models. The pressing challenge is to understand the impact of permafrost thawing on climate change and its implications for the environment, for the indigenous populations and the local communities. Finally, permafrost thawing affects the stability of built infrastructure.
Scope:
Actions should assess the impact of permafrost thawing on Arctic (natural and human) coastal systems and its effect on the availability/accessibility of resources, the stability of infrastructure, the growth of potential new economic activities, as well as on pollution and health. The research should employ a holistic and trans-disciplinary approach and in co-operation with stakeholders. It should consider the needs of and the impacts on indigenous populations, local communities and economic actors operating in this vulnerable region in the sustainable development context. Actions should address key processes of environmental change and develop appropriate adaptation and mitigation responses with an emphasis on permafrost at the interface between land and water.
Proposals should develop relevant forms of communication for EU (and possible national) services to adequately disseminate results that could be used for policy action. Trans-disciplinary and participatory approaches, including social sciences and humanities, in the process are considered necessary. In line with the strategy for EU international cooperation in research and innovation[1], actions will contribute to implementing the Transatlantic Ocean Research Alliance. Due to the specific challenge of this topic, in addition to the minimum number of participants set out in the General Annexes, proposals should benefit from the inclusion of partners from the USA and from Canada[2]. International cooperation with partners from other Arctic and non-Arctic third countries is also strongly encouraged.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of up to EUR 10 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude the submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Projects funded under this topic will by default participate in the Pilot on Open Research Data in Horizon 2020, with the option to opt-out, as described in the introduction[3].
Expected Impact:
Improve the capacity to predict the impacts of permafrost thawing, both sub-sea and on land, identify and reduce uncertainties, and quantify key processes not currently or poorly represented in predictive models;
Develop capacity to manage risks and to take advantage of opportunities emerging from Arctic changes;
Promote the engagement of and interaction with residents of Arctic coastal communities and indigenous societies and develop a legacy of collaborative community involvement with scientific, economic, and societal actors and stakeholders on the development of Responsible Research and Innovation agendas that meet their concerns and expectations;
Contribute to the ongoing and possible future OSPAR actions in Arctic water;
Improve the professional skills and competences for those working and being trained to work within this subject area;

Specific challenge: Control of the production process, biological and environmental sustainability is necessary but not sufficient to ensure the economic sustainability of a seafood production enterprise. Fisheries and aquaculture sectors face competition in the global marketplace, both for inputs and for outputs. In addition, the limited availability of appropriate production and socio-economic data hampers the development of reliable models and prediction tools. Meeting these challenges is necessary for ensuring the long term economic sustainability of European fisheries and aquaculture sectors (marine and freshwater).
Scope:Proposals should focus on the economic sustainability of European fisheries and aquaculture (marine and freshwater), which is defined as the long term economic viability of the sector. Proposals should study and analyse production segments, systems and products, taking into account supply chains and markets as well as attempts to increase social awareness of health claims and acceptance of aquaculture products. They should consider and analyse the effects of several factors, including production costs, productivity growth, market development, supply chain, demand and supply characteristics, international trade price fluctuations, innovation and product development, etc. In addition, the impact of different regulatory systems on the profitability and growth of these sectors should be evaluated.
Proposals should also focus on the trends and dynamics of European and global seafood markets and explore the competitive potential of European fisheries and aquaculture products in this context. They should also investigate the interaction between European fisheries and aquaculture products in local and global markets. They should identify and analyse successful seafood products, investigate market niches as well as the potential of existing marketing tools promoting responsible practices (labels, certification schemes etc.) to boost the competitiveness of the European fishing and aquaculture industry. Finally, they should compile and quantify non market values of fisheries and aquaculture.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU in the range of EUR 5 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected impact:
Consolidation of the economic sustainability of European fisheries and aquaculture sectors (marine and freshwater).
Scientific support to fishermen and aquaculture producers to better understand and benefit from the functioning of their markets.
Availability of tools for production planning and development of novel products and markets, taking into account trends in the local and global seafood value chain and consumers preferences.
Better understanding of the value chain organisation and of prices cycles, including in particular the 'boom and bust' cycles, and availability of solutions for predicting and avoiding similar situations in the future.

Specific challenge: The development of the new maritime economy can have important socioeconomic consequences in coastal areas and in the marine space (synergies and/or conflicts of use between old and new activities). These developments, together with the pressures from human activities and climate change on the marine environment, make it crucial to engage with citizens and stakeholders about seas and ocean challenges.
We will not achieve a sustainable exploitation of marine resources and a good environmental status of our seas and oceans unless citizens understand the influence of seas and oceans on their lives and how their behaviour can have an impact on marine ecosystems. This is a pre-requisite to develop the ecosystem based approach for marine activities and promote the understanding/protection of marine ecosystem services.
Scope: Proposals should focus on compiling existing knowledge in the broad area of Seas and Ocean Health (environmental status, pollution affecting marine biodiversity and ecosystems, ecosystem services). Attention will be paid to the impact this has on citizens, including on Human Health. Information collected should be turned into communication material, to be used for dissemination and engagement with societal stakeholders and public at large, e.g. via schools, aquaria, maritime and science museums[1]. Ocean literacy in the EU should be promoted in a traditional or in a proactive mutual learning way by engaging with citizens as responsible actors of change in marine challenges. In line with the objectives of the EU strategy for international cooperation in research and innovation (COM (2012) 497), proposals should benefit from the inclusion of partners established in third countries, in particular the US and Canada[2], given the high potential for knowledge sharing in this field[3].
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU in the range of EUR 3.5 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected impact:
Develop citizens’ understanding of the importance of Seas and Ocean Health, as well as interactions and interdependencies between the two, fostering behavioural change;
Support the ecosystem based approach in the management of maritime activities and contribute to the objectives of the Marine Strategy Framework Directive,

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Systems biology and synthetic biology are scientific fields with potential to transform our way to understand and interact with nature. Synthetic biology combines knowledge and tools from biology and engineering for the design of biological systems that are thus programmed to do what we want them to do, be it for pharmaceutical products (e.g. active pharmaceutical agents or enzymes), in the environment (e.g. bio-pesticides), or industry (e.g. biochemicals).
Standardisation in electric and mechanical engineering has underpinned the success of global industrial production. However, the question remains about how much of this can be imported into the biological domain. Standards for the biological components used by synthetic biology will facilitate creating the blueprint of a given component with identical representation methods. This could bring major advancement in biotechnology and strengthen European leadership in future biotechnological research and production.
Scope:
Proposals will be based on equivalent standardisation experiences that can be imported into the biological realm along with a thorough analysis of the functions of live systems that can be amenable to standardisation, generating new approaches where previous experiences do not apply. It will involve a dialogue with experts of the relevant disciplines on the necessary steps to set up principles for understanding, measuring, refining and, to the extent possible, standardizing the engineering of biological systems in support of their broad application in different industrial sectors. Standardisation will be considered in the following fronts: designation of the component/part, specifications, methodologies involved and assembly. Proposals will take into consideration worldwide actions to create synergies and partnerships between leading EU and international scientists, engineers and industrialists.
Proposals will include Social Sciences and Humanities (SSH) elements regarding the ethical dimensions and the environmental impact of products issued from synthetic biology research.
In line with the strategy for EU international cooperation in research and innovation (COM(2012)497), international cooperation is particularly encouraged.
Proposals submitted under this topic should include actions designed to facilitate cooperation with other projects; to enhance user involvement; and to ensure the accessibility and reusability of data produced in the course of the project.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU up to EUR 2 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
A list of the most urgent standardisation needs via current practice leading to homogeneity in research and production;
Identified scientific research gaps whose elucidation would accelerate standards-driven biological engineering;
A realistic strategy based on research programmes, resources, facilities and structures needed to sustainably support the establishment of and compliance with standards for synthetic biology in the EU in the medium to long term.

Agricultural productivity that does not keep up with the current population increase, the growing demand for biomass production (as feedstock for biofuels) and the nonstop rise of global CO2 emissions with its consequences for climate change, are all circumstances that make it urgent to increase the yield of biomass. Indeed, increased agricultural yield efficiency can have huge impacts in a society driven by the bio-economy.
Plants use photosynthesis to grow, converting energy from the sun into storable carbohydrates. Chloroplasts are the minute energy factories in the plant leaves that absorb the sun’s energy, release oxygen into the air and use hydrogen plus CO2 to make the compounds that plants need to grow. Biotechnology has succeeded in the engineering of nuclear and chloroplasts genomes for the production of enzymes, raw materials and building blocks for the chemical industry. However, research to increase the efficiency of the enzymes that drive photosynthesis has not yet produced the desired results. Currently available ground-breaking and disruptive technologies coupled with the integration of knowledge from diverse scientific disciplines have the potential to propose new solutions to boost the efficiency of photosynthesis.
Scope:
Proposals should work towards the optimisation of photosynthesis by capitalising on multidisciplinary approaches, such as functional genomics, systems biology, metabolic modelling, enzyme engineering, computational biology, synthetic biology, directed evolution and gene editing techniques.
Proposals should work with plants or algae and deal with any of the biological components underlying the diversity of photosynthesis. Proposals can involve new strategies to engineer the chloroplast genome, new strategies to engineer relevant enzymes, the development of metabolic models that contribute to a higher understanding of the properties of photosynthesis, among others.
Proposals should cover at least one of the following:
new tools improving the performance of the catalytic enzymes involved in photosynthesis;
new tools to increase the rate of CO2-fixation;
engineered enzymes for novel CO2-fixation pathways.
Proposals should include Social Sciences and Humanities (SSH) elements regarding the technologies used and the environmental and socio-economic impact of the expected output.
Proposals submitted under this topic should include actions designed to facilitate cooperation with other projects; to enhance user involvement; and to ensure the accessibility and reusability of data produced in the course of the project.

","11 September 2018","Specific Challenge:
The Atlantic Ocean is an invaluable shared resource. The societal value of its blue economy is enormous for countries located on its shores. There are however, still considerable gaps in our knowledge and understanding of processes related to this ocean especially with regard to its chemistry, ecology, biodiversity, impacts of climate and the potential for the sustainable exploitation of its natural resources including aquaculture. The Atlantic Ocean is subject to a range of pressures, such as impacts related to climate change, pollution, fishing above sustainable levels, mining and coastal eutrophication. Both remote and local forces play a role in these changes and it is necessary to consider local, regional and basin-wide drivers and factors to understand, predict and adapt to change. Furthermore, the potential of seafood to reduce food and nutrition insecurity calls for collaboration at international level. Having already demonstrated how successful research cooperation can be in the North Atlantic Ocean[1] in tackling some of these issues, the objective now is to take a systemic approach to tackle the scientific and socio-economic challenges and to move towards a basin-wide cooperation from Antarctica to the Arctic, through enhanced cooperation with countries bordering the South Atlantic, notably Brazil and South Africa[2].
Scope:
The actions shall aim at understanding and sustainably managing the Atlantic Ocean as a whole, through a large-scale basin effort involving both the northern and the southern parts of this ocean and its interlinks with the adjacent areas. In order to achieve this, it is necessary to bring together and systematically connect scientists, stakeholders, data, knowledge, expertise, capacities, and resources. This is only feasible through the synergistic cooperation among the bordering countries. With the development of a South Atlantic Ocean Science Plan[3] focusing on the challenges and research needs of the South Atlantic Ocean, which are also interconnected with the challenges and research needs of the North Atlantic Ocean, this cooperation can converge towards the implementation of a systemic approach by linking and jointly tackling the climate-food-ocean challenges. Overall, activities shall contribute to upscale cooperation along and across the Atlantic Ocean and the creation of long-term partnerships building on on-going initiatives such as the All Atlantic Ocean Research Alliance. In order to realise this, proposals shall address one of the following sub-topics:
[A] 2018 - Coordination of marine and maritime research and innovation activities in the Atlantic Ocean. Activities shall launch a multi-stakeholder platform to reinforce international cooperation between Europe and tropical and South Atlantic countries and to connect with the challenges and research needs of the North Atlantic Ocean, as outlined above. The platform shall address the key following points: enhance business opportunities and the up-take of innovations e.g. aquaculture production systems, marine and maritime technologies; develop common standards e.g. for deep ocean and shelf observing systems, seafloor mapping, ecosystem approaches in utilizing marine living resources; reinforce capacity building by aligning European training programmes, including through industrial apprenticeship opportunities and networking with Atlantic partners; promote citizen awareness and literacy on ocean issues; align and converge international research and innovation cooperation activities and other relevant initiatives and investments between the northern and southern Atlantic countries. It will upscale cooperation with countries bordering the South Atlantic Ocean, in particular Brazil and South Africa, by reinforcing the mutual benefits of science diplomacy, addressing the grand challenges and opportunities of the Atlantic Ocean as a system, exploiting the benefits it holds for our citizens and entering a new era of Blue Enlightenment which spans from Antarctica to the Arctic.
This action should build on past and ongoing regional, national initiatives and programmes e.g. PIRATA[4], SAMOC[5], SA MAR-ECO[6], GEOTRACES[7], SOLAS[8], OTN[9], ICEMASA[10], BCLME[11], and EU projects e.g. MAREFRAME, BIOMORE, ATLANTOS, AORAC-SA, EU POLAR Net, INMARE, PREFACE etc. as well as national initiatives across and alongside the Atlantic Ocean. It should also involve (or liaise with) relevant European research infrastructures such as Euro-Argo ERIC and EMSO ERIC. In agreement with the Commission services, projects should ensure appropriate flexibility so as to respond in real time to potentially fast-changing policy scenarios.
[B] 2018-2019- Assessing the status of Atlantic marine ecosystems. Activities shall enhance the knowledge on the status and dynamics of Atlantic marine ecosystems, quantifying main drivers of short and long-term change, examine the interactions between different stressors, including climate change, and the role of cumulative impacts on ecosystem functioning and associated ecosystem services. They shall also contribute to improve the sustainability of the exploitation of the marine resources, through extending climate based predictions as well as testing for so-called tipping points, regimes shifts or more advanced assessments of ecosystem stability. Activities may entail 3D–mapping of the water column and high resolution seafloor mapping of selected large areas (including relevant marine ecosystems), considering the feasibility/safety and sustainability of these maritime operations. Mapping shall include variables of a different nature, such as physical, biological, chemical, habitats, seafloor characteristics and integrity (including in relation to climate change) and may require the development of new technologies. Furthermore, demonstration of cost-effective approaches to management and processing of the large quantities of data, better coordinated data sharing and operability, as well as the development of improved forecasting capabilities of stressors, tipping points, recovery and changes in ecosystem state will be important. The participation of industrial and regional stakeholders is encouraged to help define ecosystem-requirements. All data collected by the projects (including in international waters) shall be made open access by the end of the project. The choices of the selected areas need to be justified. Actions shall include capacity building and training with/in countries bordering the South and Tropical Atlantic Ocean. Links with ongoing initiatives such as EMODNet should be considered. The activities will be carried out in close co-operation with relevant Commission services (Directorate-General for Research and Innovation), ensuring coherence with related policy initiatives.
[C] 2018-2019- New value chains for aquaculture[12] production. Activities shall explore new species, products and/or processes for aquaculture production (including algae). They shall consider existing, emerging and potential markets, take into consideration sound cost-effective production methods, sustainability and profitability. Consideration shall be given to the design of Internet of Things (IoT) approaches in the development of innovative production technologies, including new/improved biosensors, the circularity of the processes with the objective of zero waste and consider consumers' concerns and demands. The development of monitoring programmes for risk assessment including emerging pollutants and climate change resilience and mitigation will be essential. Activities shall contribute to reduce risks to human health. They will also foster higher levels of economic productivity through diversification, technological upgrading and innovation, including through a focus on high-value added and labour-intensive sectors. Finally, it will be important to reinforce capacity building by aligning training programmes, including through industrial apprenticeship opportunities and networking along and across the Atlantic Ocean, in particular, but not exclusively, with South Africa and Brazil and other Atlantic Ocean coastal states. Reinforcing links between industrial partners is also crucial to exchange best practices and to facilitate the creation of business opportunities, therefore the SME participation in this topic is encouraged.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU respectively in the range of EUR 4 million for sub-topic [A] (Coordination and Support Action), EUR 9 million for sub-topic [B] (Research and Innovation Action) and EUR 8 million for sub-topic [C] (Research and Innovation Action) would allow this specific challenge to be adequately addressed. Nonetheless, this does not preclude the submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Consortia submitting proposals to this Flagship are encouraged to include participants from countries bordering the Atlantic Ocean (North and South) as their active participation is key to the success of the proposals.
Proposals shall include a task to cluster with other projects financed under this topic and – if possible – with other relevant projects in the field funded by Horizon 2020. Possible links with related research and innovation activities supported by the Belmont Forum[13] on Ocean sustainability shall also be considered.
Expected Impact:
In order to contribute to the implementation of the EU Integrated Maritime Policy and its related Atlantic Strategy and Action Plan, the EU Blue Growth Strategy, the EU Marine Strategy Framework Directive, the EU Maritime Spatial Planning Directive, the EU International Ocean Governance Communication, the EU Communication for a Sustainable European Future, the UN SDGs, the EU Food 2030[14] process for food and nutrition security, as well as the Atlantic Ocean Research Alliance, activities shall:

Molecular farming involves the production of pharmaceutical and industrial compounds in plants through advanced technologies and it offers a competitive platform for the manufacturing of high-end products. Examples are plant-derived vaccines and the production of other commercially valuable proteins or small molecules. Indeed, plants are highly amenable to the production of a wide range of proteins, some of which are specific. In addition, the scalability allowed by plants exceeds that of other production systems. Molecular farming represents a development opportunity for a set of new high-value crops, for the health, chemical and agricultural industries and their related technology sectors.
In the past ten years, a wide range of new plant breeding techniques (NPBT) have been developed to produce, with high efficacy and efficiency, new plants with the desired traits. The use of NPBT for molecular farming could provide opportunities for new crops for the production of bioproducts, while maintaining the position of leadership of the European plant breeding sector in research and innovation.
Scope:
Proposals should use the new plant breeding technologies comprised in the NPBT set[1] , with plants amenable to be used as green factories in order to yield industrial high-value products. Proposals should address at least one of the following areas:
Minor, underutilized and non-food crops suitable for the extraction of bioactive compounds.
Crops that grow more efficiently and have higher yields of the target bioproduct, while being more tolerant to adverse environmental conditions.
Improved plant-based low-cost platforms for commercial production of bioproducts.
Proposals should address elements of Social Sciences and Humanities (SSH), contributing to a better understanding of plant breeding and related biotechnologies by the general public.
Activities are expected to focus on Technology Readiness Levels 3 to 5.

Although Europe enjoys a lead position in science and technology, including biotechnology, in comparison with other world regions European technology base is often scattered and very diverse in terms of regional and national capacities. If Europe is to keep its leadership in Biotechnology, its R&D&I funding agencies, in particular the European Commission, need to stay abreast of progress in the areas they fund to ensure utmost relevance of their activities. In the Biotechnology areas stakeholder roadmaps and scientific publications are often outpaced by rapid progress made in research. The cross-cutting nature of biotechnology also requires targeting the limited funds available in the most efficient way. It is thus essential to forecast the future of R&D&I needs closely, in order to identify major opportunities that are not only readily feasible but also of high value, while achieving a positive public perception of biotechnologies and the potential they hold.
Scope:
Proposals should use a multidisciplinary approach, including modelling and simulation, to provide comprehensive and dependable information about the future industrial biotechnology scenario (including pharmaceuticals) in the EU in the short and medium-term. Proposals should consider the potential of industrial biotechnology innovation for enabling the European industry to deliver high-value products satisfying evolving consumer needs, the creation of new commercial opportunities and the possible risks for people's health and the environment. European capacities in terms of human resources, infrastructures, research and development and public and private stakeholders should be taken into account. Proposals should also identify links with policy development, and the preparation of the future programmes beyond Horizon 2020. It should be demonstrated that the proposed activities are complementary to related activities under the Societal Challenges 'Health, demographic change and well-being', 'Food security, sustainable agriculture and forestry, marine, maritime and inland water research'; 'Secure, clean and efficient energy'; and the Bio-Based Industries JTI.
Insofar as possible, proposals will address Social Sciences and Humanities (SSH) elements, for example changing consumers' needs and the public perception of biotechnologies for industrial uses.

Nowadays CO2 re-use is one of several technological ways to reduce otherwise harmful CO2 emissions, thus making CO2 a valuable commodity rather than a pollutant. However, the research behind full development of CO2 reuse technologies is in its early stages. Some of these technologies use CO2 as a feedstock for chemicals and plastics, thus increasing the industrial biotechnology potential for enhancing European economic competitiveness. In this way, tackling the CO2 challenge includes interesting possibilities for encouraging innovation and sustainability.
An industrial biotechnology route for CO2 re-use is fermentation, where CO2 is fermented into a desired molecule using hydrogen as a source of energy. However, there are technical issues that need to be resolved, because the biochemical reactions involved are not yet self-supporting in terms of energy for the industrial scale conversion of CO2 into chemicals. Moreover, the final yield of the products is low and the process needs optimisation. Ultimately, the success of CO2 reuse technologies will depend on developing processes which are less energy and material intensive than the processes they aim to replace and which can be scaled to an industrial level of production. In this context, an important consideration or advantage would be the ability of the microbes to process raw CO2 (low concentrations, presence of impurities, etc.). Therefore, substantial research is required to achieve the goal of a CO2 economy.
Scope:
Proposals should address current limitations of CO2 reuse technologies based on microbial platforms, by developing their full potential, and need to cover one or more of the following issues:
Microbes with an improved ability to convert CO2 as a feedstock into chemicals and plastics.
Discovery of new, more active and robust enzymes for improved bio-catalysis.
Design of new synthetic microbial systems to produce useful enzymes.
Improved microbes with resistance to impurities, by-products and target products.
Exploring the potential application sectors of the products and technologies to be developed.
Proposals should address elements of Social Sciences and Humanities (SSH), exploring the public perception and acceptance of the technology of CO2 reuse.
Proposals can be considered complementary to those dealing with CO2 reuse in the SPIRE public-private partnership (Part 17 of this Work Programme), where the issue is being tackled from a purely chemical perspective.
Activities are expected to focus on Technology Readiness Levels 3 to 5. This topic addresses cross-KET activities.
Insofar as possible, proposals will involve SMEs and engage in international cooperation,
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU between EUR 5 and 7 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
Development and validation of at least two microbial cell factories;
Development of concepts for solving challenges expected by an industrial-scale implementation;
Contribution to the reduction in CO2 emissions in the medium to long term;
Supporting the EU in becoming a global leader in CO2 re-use technologies through the utilisation of microbial platforms.
Proposals should include a business case and exploitation strategy, as outlined in the Introduction to the LEIT part of this Work Programme.
Cross-cutting Priorities:

","08 September 2015","Scope:
Specific challenge: One of the greatest challenge facing the biotechnology community today is to be able to make use of the vast and dynamic influx of ""omics"" data. The synchronised development of bioinformatic concepts and related computational tools for prediction and modelling is a prerequisite to enable the exploitation of this wealth of biological data as a source of new biotechnological applications. These can range from industry and health to the environment and agriculture. Ethical aspects such as those related to confidentiality, sensitive data and data property are relevant to some bioinformatics applications.
Scope: Proposals should develop innovative bioinformatics approaches to close the gap between data availability and the discovery of new biotechnological applications. Proposals should in particular address the needs of SMEs active in the bioinformatics sector and should take into consideration international activities with the objective of fostering global solutions, standards and interoperability. Practical testing for validation of bioinformatics approaches should be considered.
Ethical aspects are to be addressed if relevant to the targeted research. Activities will span between Technology Readiness Levels 3 and 5. Key challenges in this endeavour are:
                     Development and/or integration of application-oriented databases taking into account the physical distribution, semantic heterogeneity, co-existence of different computational models and data and, as a consequence, of different interfaces.
            New efficient statistical approaches for increased interpretative and predictive capacity of data, which are taking into account of the molecular complexity of living systems.
            Innovative visualization methods, dedicated to an integrative and synthetic representation of large and heterogeneous datasets involving intuitive tools for visualising and examining data.
For this topic, proposals should include an outline of the initial exploitation and business plans, which will be developed further in the proposed project.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU between EUR 6 and 10 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected impact:
                    Facilitated access, handing and exploitation of existing databases paving the way for new biotechnological applications.
                    Bridging existing information from various application areas.
                    Accelerated process design and reduced time-to-market enabled by bioinformatics tools such as modelling and prediction.

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
The EU depends strongly on external sources for the supply of key fertilisers used in agriculture. Resource depletion and an increasing global demand for mineral fertilisers may, in the long term, lead to price tensions with an impact on food security. Mineral-based fertilisation also poses significant environmental problems, linked e.g. to the amounts of fossil energy needed to produce and transport these fertilisers. At the same time, large amounts of minerals are being dispersed in the environment through a large variety of organic waste streams, resulting in soil, water and air pollution. Agri-food specialisation has led to regional imbalances: whilst in some regions a nutrient overabundance is causing severe environmental impacts (e.g. nitrate pollution), other are experiencing nutrient deficits. These contrasting effects may also be observed between locations within the same region.
Several technologies are being developed to recover and re-use nutrients from organic by-products and waste streams, but many are insufficiently mature and the characteristics of end-products do not always match end-user preferences. It is expected that the EU ‘circular economy package’ will boost the emergence and commercialisation of such new fertilisers, hence it is important to understand their agronomic and environmental performance in order to establish adequate policies, guidelines and application rules.
Scope:
Proposals shall address inter-regional and intra-regional imbalances through effective nutrient recovery from by-products of the agri-food or forestry sectors, or from waste water and sewage sludge, and conversion into novel fertilisers.
Proposals should address only one of the following sub-topics:
A.[2018] Understanding properties and impacts of bio-based fertilisers (RIA)
The project shall generate a knowledge basis that could support policy decisions related to novel fertilisers based on organic resources[1]. On the basis of products that are currently available or under development, a comprehensive set of potential environmental impacts shall be identified and assessed across the fertiliser value chain[2], along with criteria related to their agronomic performance, safety and quality. Parameters and reference values shall be proposed as a basis for future policies related to new organic-based fertilisers. The project shall also propose reliable analytical measurement and testing methods for future compliance checks. An analysis of nutrient imbalances between regions in the EU shall be carried out, and the viability and sustainability of nutrient flows between regions through new organic-based fertilisers (including the understanding of logistic costs) shall be assessed.
B.[2019] Bio-based fertilisers from animal manure (IA)
Projects shall demonstrate processes for recovery of mineral nutrients and production of novel fertilisers from animal manure. Proposals shall perform a thorough analysis of the state of the art, and demonstrate that the activities proposed go beyond past or ongoing research, without overlaps. Technologies that are currently under development shall be further improved, and possibly integrated, to produce high quality end-products[3]. Proposals shall address end-product marketability, safety, sustainability including emissions of greenhouse gasses and pollutants, and compliance with relevant EU regulations[4]. Their suitability and acceptability under the organic farming regulatory framework shall also be analysed. An integrated assessment of the business model (economic, agronomic, social and environmental) shall be performed. The whole value chain shall be demonstrated to a near-commercial scale (TRL 6-7). Proposals shall fall under the concept of the 'multi-actor approach'[5] including relevant actors such as agri-food industries, technology providers, research centres, end-users (farmers and farmer associations), or public administration.
C.[2020] Bio-based fertilisers from by-products of the agri-food, fisheries, aquaculture or forestry sectors (IA)
Projects shall demonstrate processes for recovery of mineral nutrients and production of novel fertilisers from by-products of the agri-food, fisheries, aquaculture or forestry sectors, excluding animal manure, water and sewage sludge (covered in scopes B and D). Proposals should demonstrate that the activities proposed go beyond past or ongoing research, without overlaps. Technologies that are currently under development should be further improved, and possibly integrated, to produce high quality end-products[6]. Proposals shall address end product marketability, safety, sustainability including emissions of greenhouse gasses and pollutants, and compliance with relevant EU regulations. Their suitability and acceptability under the organic farming regulatory framework should also be analysed. An integrated assessment of the business model (economic, agronomic, social and environmental) shall be performed. The whole value chain shall be demonstrated to a near-commercial scale (TRL 6-7). Proposals shall fall under the concept of the 'multi-actor approach'[5], including relevant actors such as agri-food industries, technology providers, research centres, end-users (farmers and farmer associations), or public administration.
D.[2020] Bio-based fertilisers from waste water and sewage sludge (RIA)
Projects shall develop techniques for nutrients recovery from waste water streams such as urban and industrial waste water, sewage sludge from waste water treatment plants, brine from water desalination or demineralisation plants[8]. Building on related work under previous research framework programmes and other EU-funded programmes, projects should design and test techniques for nutrients recovery and subsequent mechanical, chemical or biological processes to upgrade recovered nutrients. The monitoring and removal or mitigation of contaminants affecting food safety, human and ecosystem health (e.g. pharmaceuticals in sewage sludge) in recovered nutrients should be key in the process design. A life-cycle assessment should be carried out in order to evaluate the environmental impacts of processes along the whole value chain, including waste/residues, and products’ environmental performances. Regulation issues should be part of the investigation. Involvement of governments at different levels as regards regulation issues, regional/local strategies and territorial development plans is an asset.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU in the range of EUR 6 million for sub-topic A and D and EUR 8 million for sub-topics B and C would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless this does not preclude the submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts. Proposals for sub-topics A, B and C should include a task to cluster with other projects financed under this topic, under topic SFS-39-2019 and - if possible - with other relevant projects in the field funded by Horizon 2020 (including under the BBI JU). For sub-topics B and C, participation of partners from CELAC countries[9] is encouraged.
Expected Impact:
Proposals are expected to provide the technologies needed to develop a new generation of commercial, sustainable and safe fertilisers based on organic by-products, and the scientific knowledge needed to frame their use. This will help to:
set up a coherent policy framework for the sustainable production and use of organic-based fertilisers (sub-topic A);
replace non-renewable mineral fertilisers, hence reducing external dependence and risks related to depletion (sub-topics A, B, C and D);
balance nutrient concentrations between or within regions, thus increasing resource efficiency (sub-topics A, B and C);
reduce the environmental impacts linked to the dispersion of nutrients present in waste flows, to the emissions of greenhouse gases, or to the production of fossil-based fertilisers (sub-topics A, B, C and D);
develop new business models creating value from agri-food, fisheries, aquaculture or forestry by-products (sub-topics B and C) and from water sector and the industrial sector subject to waste water treatment, including desalination or demineralisation plants (sub-topic D).
In the long term, this should contribute to a thriving, sustainable and circular bio-economy, the development of new business models that are synergic with other economic sectors, and therefore to the creation of wealth and quality jobs in rural areas.

","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
In order to secure the sustainable access to primary and secondary raw materials, including metals, industrial minerals, construction raw materials, wood, and particularly Critical Raw Materials (CRMs) for the EU economy, there is a need to tackle a number of specific non-technological challenges at local, regional, national, EU and global levels.
Illegal shipments of waste, both within the EU and to non-EU countries, and poor recycling have adverse effects on human health and the environment, create unfair competition for law abiding operators and give rise to the loss of valuable resources in the case of poor or no treatment. However, port authorities and enforcement authorities have limited resources to control the ever increasing amount of material shipped and this without blocking normal traffic. In addition, at the moment there is no distinction in customs codes between “new goods” and “second hand goods” which implies that illegal waste shipments are often disguised as “second hand goods”.
Currently, at most only one third of waste wood is recycled, the rest being landfilled or incinerated and there are great differences between Member States in wood recycling performance. Increasing production costs combined with stagnating product prices in recent years have put pressure on the profit margins of the EU woodworking industries, mostly dominated by SMEs. There is a need for higher resource efficiency and increased use of recycled wood in wood processing that can provide measurable improvements in company profitability.
Requirements for responsible sourcing in the raw materials value chain have recently been strengthened in one aspect by the new EU Conflict Minerals legislation. However, the need for the industry to engage in responsible sourcing and responsible business conduct and to perform relevant due diligence goes beyond legislative obligations – it is rooted in the growing expectations of consumers, civil society, governments and procurement managers (buyers). While it is very difficult for individual operators to meet such expectations due to the limited availability of the necessary information, downstream industries increasingly require all operators in their supply chain to address risks by performing due diligence. Responsible sourcing of raw materials is becoming a new business reality; in the short term it may offer a competitive advantage to frontrunners and in the long term, it could become a necessary ""license to operate"" and, given the global character of today's supply chains, it is also a way to be integrated in global supply chains.
Scope:
All actions should contribute to building the EU knowledge base of primary and secondary raw materials (EC Raw Materials Information System – RMIS[1]).
In support of the EIP on Raw Materials actions should envisage clustering activities with other relevant selected projects for cross-projects co-operation, consultations and joint activities on cross-cutting issues and share of results as well as participating in joint meetings and communication events. To this end proposals should foresee a dedicated work package and/or task, and earmark the appropriate resources accordingly.
Actions should address only one of the following sub-topics[2]:
a) Voluntary scheme for certification of treatment facilities for key types of wastes (2018): Actions should develop and launch a voluntary scheme for certification – including verification – of treatment facilities for key types of waste/recyclates containing significant amounts of critical raw materials (e.g. electronic waste and/or waste batteries). The scheme should integrate measurable and verifiable minimum quality standards and a verification procedure based on traceability through the supply chain from collection to end-processing. Participation of relevant stakeholders – including waste holders, dealers, brokers and operators of treatment facilities – from the conception phase of the scheme should be ensured. Full compliance with applicable WTO rules and with the rules and principles of the Basel Convention should be ensured, and existing certification schemes for waste should be taken into account.
In line with the strategy for EU international cooperation in research and innovation (COM(2012)497), international cooperation is encouraged.
The Commission considers that for this sub-topic, proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of up to EUR 2 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
b) Resource efficiency in wood processing, recovery and recycling (2018): Actions should identify, assess and document existing practices in a representative set of EU Member States/Associated Countries and possibly third countries, and create a network to widely disseminate and transfer good practices covering both issues: resource-efficient wood processing and wood waste recycling. Resource-efficient wood processing in the woodworking sector should improve companies' operational performance and hence the EU sector's overall competitiveness. Quality-oriented and cost-efficient wood waste collection systems, sorting and recycling, and design solutions should facilitate increased wood recycling together with increased product quality and market acceptance of recovered wood in new products. Involvement of relevant stakeholders across value chains is necessary, including wood processing industries, research & innovation institutes, woodworking products end-users, municipalities and other parties dealing with wood waste collection, sorting and recycling. Actions should also assess trade-offs between wood waste use for material and energy. This assessment should be based on life cycle analysis and all sustainability pillars, and consider impacts on sustainable forest operations and ecosystems integrity (for all major EU forest regions) and impacts of intra-EU trade[3]. Proposals should include the participation of industrial SMEs, as far as possible.
The Commission considers that for this sub-topic, proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of up to EUR 3 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
c) Responsible sourcing of raw materials in global value chains (2019): Actions should create a global business and stakeholder platform for exchange of information and the promotion of responsible sourcing and responsible business conduct involving a network of key international experts and stakeholders. The aim is to engage governmental and corporate partners from the EU/Associated Countries and third countries in developing a globally acceptable concept of a responsible sourcing in minerals and metals value chains.
The platform should develop ideas for creating incentives for responsible sourcing in raw materials value chains, strengthen EU outreach to third countries to promote the concept in intergovernmental forums and to establish responsible sourcing in EU business practice. Interaction with other related existing platforms, networks and initiatives is encouraged. Actions should consider the relevant aspects related to environmental sustainability.
In line with the strategy for EU international cooperation in research and innovation (COM(2012)497), international cooperation is encouraged, particularly with partners from advanced countries using raw materials[2].
The Commission considers that for this sub-topic, proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of up to EUR 3 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
The project results are expected to contribute to:

In order to secure the sustainable access to primary and secondary raw materials, including metals, industrial minerals, construction raw materials, wood, and particularly Critical Raw Materials (CRMs) for the EU economy, there is a need to tackle a number of specific non-technological challenges at local, regional, national, EU and global levels.
The supply of CRMs to the EU is at risk as they are often mined as by-products and usually still have recycling rates below 1% after decades of use. There is a need for an expert advice in support of decision-making at the EU level covering all the raw materials and their value chains screened in the CRMs assessment[1].
Scope:
All actions should contribute to improving EU official statistics and to building the EU knowledge base of primary and secondary raw materials (EC Raw Materials Information System – RMIS[2]).
Clustering and cooperation with other selected projects under this cross-cutting call and other relevant projects supporting the EIP on Raw Materials is strongly encouraged.
Actions should strengthen an EU expert network and community covering all raw materials screened in the CRM assessment of 2017[3], and once available also the raw materials of 2020 assessment. The consortium should organise the expert community across the EU covering expertise on primary and secondary resources; production, including exploration, mining, processing, recycling and refining; substitution of CRM; raw materials markets; future demand and supply; materials flows; socio-economic analysis, and strategic value chains and end-use sectors, including batteries, e-mobility, renewable energy, electronics, defence and aerospace.
The actions should improve data and knowledge on all screened raw materials; flexibly support the Commission in policy making related to CRM in general or linked to specific applications or sectors; as well in the relevant events organised by the Commission. The actions should also support the Commission in the analysis of the future supply and demand of raw materials, policy and technology gaps and innovation potential along the raw materials value chains.

","Research and Innovation action
","12 November 2019
","03 September 2020","Specific Challenge:
Composite or multi-layer materials are increasingly used in different applications. Products and materials are getting more and more complex, which affects the ability to retain the value of materials in successive uses. While the combination of different materials may provide unique and desirable properties to products, it also brings challenges for the sorting, separation, recycling or composting of the materials that constitute the products, whether in a compound form or separately. It also complicates their re-introduction into manufacturing processes. A better understanding of these challenges should inform the design of composites and multi-layer materials.
Scope:
Proposals are expected to develop new or improve existing innovative processes for the sorting, disassembly/separation, recycling and/or the introduction into manufacturing process of materials from products made of composite and/or multi-layer materials and assess the potential barriers for their implementation. They can deal with used products, production rejects or existing stocks such us material recovered from industrial and municipal landfills. Proposals should aim to optimise value retention in the economy, rather than downgrading the composite or multi-layer materials for applications with low quality requirements, as compared to the value of the initial separate materials, especially for applications with high performance requirements. Proposals should also provide recommendations for the design of these applications, products or related materials, based on the lessons learned in the development of these processes, to enable an increase in volume and quality of reuse and recycling of these products. In addition, these recommendations should cover requirements for product information to enable effective identification and management after use (including consumer targeted labelling, where appropriate). The environmental impact (e.g. substitution of virgin plastics, water saving, impact on water quality), social impact (e.g. related to health and safety legislation) and cost of the innovative processes implemented (e.g. recycling processes) should be assessed in a holistic way, taking the entire lifecycle into account. The proposals are expected to provide evidence of the potential market impact that the proposed solutions could bring, including impacts on current economic actors in the chain and anticipated consumer acceptance and changes of consumer attitude (taking into account gender issues, when relevant). To this end, quantitative information on the size of the targeted market is expected. Participation of relevant industrial partners (technology providers, end-users etc.) is considered important. Activities are expected to achieve TRL 5-6 by the end of the project.
This topic is in support of the European Strategy for Plastics in a Circular Economy. Selected projects under this topic as well as projects selected under other topics in H2020 supporting the Plastics Strategy are strongly encouraged to participate in joint activities as appropriate. These joint activities could take the form of clustering of projects, participation in workshops, common exploitation and dissemination etc. The proposals are expected to demonstrate support to common coordination and dissemination activities. Applicants should plan the necessary budget to cover those activities without the prerequisite to define concrete common actions at this stage.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU in the range of EUR 4-5 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
The project results are expected to contribute to:
increased yield and quality of sorting of products made of composite or multi-layer materials;
increased recycling of raw materials from products made of composite or multi-layer materials, in terms of volume and/or quality;
reduced use of virgin raw materials;
increased knowledge on how to design for reuse and recycling (“circular design”) of products currently made of composite or multi-layer materials;
increased knowledge on the process environmental footprint, including the net effects on greenhouse gas emissions, of improved sorting, separation and recycling of composite and multi-layer materials.

","Research and Innovation action
","12 November 2019
","03 September 2020","Specific Challenge:
The transition to a circular economy entails a systemic transformation of entire value chains, covering design, production and consumption phases, so that the value of products, materials and resources can be maintained in the economy for as long as possible, while reducing environmental impact. It also aims at increasing material productivity, including de-materialisation, and exploring new representations and practices of property for individuals and collectives. Such a deep transformation is unlikely to happen suddenly and would rather follow some transition processes and pathways. Understanding, in critical and thoughtful way, the transition to a circular economy and its positive and negative implications on the environment, economy and society (including human health), will be important for the development and adoption of circular economy approaches, including the design of well-targeted transitional policy measures. Moreover, the identification and analysis of best practices of the transition to a circular economy in- or outside Europe, on a citizen, business sectorial and macroeconomic level, possibly covering different cooperation models (including B2B, B2C, P2P, etc.) will serve as an inspiration for specific projects. They also can inform new and adapted policies and policy tools including regulation, taxation and financing, incentives, strategic governance mechanisms and soft tools (e.g. communication and awareness raising tools) to further disseminating the concept of circularity.
Scope:
The research will assess the current state of transition towards the circular economy in relevant economic sectors (public, private and non-profit) and analyse possible transition scenarios, as well as their outcomes and impacts. It will identify the key factors (regulatory, governance-based, market, technological, cultural, societal, gender, etc.) that can stimulate or hinder this transition. The selected sectors should be among the ones identified in the EU Circular Economy Action Plan. Additional sectors could also be selected, considering criteria such as environmental footprint, health issues, complexities of value-chain, dependency on imported materials and relevance for European economy. Implications of the transition, both positive and negative, for the economy, the environment and the society will be assessed qualitatively and as much as possible quantified. For that reason, appropriate models for analysing and quantifying the various implications and trade-offs and assessing the sustainability of circular economy should be developed. The implications considered should include social, economic and environmental aspects, such as trade flows, value-chains, labour demand, European industry competitiveness, regulatory frameworks, policy and governance mechanisms, public and occupational health, greenhouse gas emissions, use of energy, land, water, minerals and other resources), flows of resources at all relevant geographical scales, human health, social and territorial cohesion, and value distribution across society. The role of public awareness and acceptance and other social aspects, including gender issues, need to be considered. Where relevant, particular attention should be paid to the issue of hazardous materials in a circular economy. Policy recommendations for policy-makers at the local, national, European and global levels, including recommendations on governance issues, will be derived from the research. Involvement of relevant social sciences and humanities disciplines and expertise in behavioural economics and gender issues, is deemed important.
In line with the strategy for EU international cooperation in research and innovation (COM(2012)497), international cooperation is encouraged, in particular with Africa.

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
The challenge of providing the inhabitants of European cities with affordable, safe, and nutritious food is both urgent and complex. Moreover, the health and wellbeing of EU citizens and consumers are directly affected by the way cities and regions themselves are shaping a sustainable food environment. Research and (open) innovation co-created with citizens are part of broader city-region food system approaches. Such initiatives stimulate the development of cities as innovative food hubs. Nevertheless, there are barriers to the application and demonstration of systemic food-related innovative approaches due to the diversity of European cities and regions that are not well understood, leading to market failure in the uptake of promising research results and innovation in cities. Demonstration and first application in the market of innovative solutions, co-created with citizen and cities with the involvement of public authorities, economic actors and non-profit organisations, could be one way to support sustainable food security in cities.
Scope:
The proposals shall identify several food-related innovative approaches based on citizen science and engagement, to be practised in cities to foster sustainability of the food system. Proposals shall explore and share the application of these approaches in a wider range of European cities and shall be built on results of existing research, best practices and existing platforms and programmes. Proposals could comprise activities such as prototyping testing, demonstrating and piloting in a (near to) operational environment, as well as experimental production, all with a view to subsequent replication and application in other cities. Proposals shall include the development of a classification and assessment of the benefits (economic, environmental and societal) of existing approaches for dissemination purposes, accessible online. Proposals may include limited R&D activities and a clear focus on validating the benefits of pilot activities for citizens with a view of increasing engagement and replication. The action shall cover cities in rural and coastal areas and urban agglomerations. Proposals shall also include co-creation between social innovation and technological innovation. Following the RRI principles, proposals will ensure that societal actors work together during the whole research and innovation process in order to better align both the process and its outcomes with the values, needs and expectations of society. Active participation of municipalities and SMEs is strongly encouraged.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of the order of EUR 7.5 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
In the framework of SDG no 2, 3, 9, 11 and 12, the EU's Bioeconomy Strategy 2012, and the FOOD 2030 Staff Working Document[1], proposals should explain how activities included are expected to contribute to:
Job creation in EU cities in which good practices for sustainable food security are applied in the short term (up to 3 years), fostering thriving urban, rural and coastal economies and communities;
Intensified interactions between all actors in the food chain[2] such as research, (small scale) food production, city municipalities, education centres, consumers and citizens in the medium to long term;
Empowered local communities by using their potential to contribute to ensuring food and nutrition security at city level, which in turn supports the relevant SDGs;
Increased participatory and citizen science initiatives in the area of food and nutrition security in cities;
Easy and increased knowledge-sharing;
In the long term, positive economic, social and environmental links between urban, peri-urban and rural areas, meeting the needs, values and expectations of society in a responsible and ethical way.

Disruptions in the operation of our countries’ infrastructure may put at risk the functioning of our societies and their economies. Such disruptions may result from many kinds of hazards and physical and/or cyber-attacks on installations and systems. Recent events demonstrate the increased interconnection among the impact of hazards, of the two kinds of attacks and, conversely, the usefulness for operators to combine cyber and physical security-solutions to protect installations of the critical infrastructure of Europe: A comprehensive, yet installation-specific approach is needed to secure the integrity of existing or future, public or private, connected and interdependent installations. Since the global financial crisis has imposed unprecedented budgetary restrictions on both the public and private sectors, new security solutions must be more efficient and cost-effective than the ones currently available.
Scope:
Proposals should focus on one of the following critical infrastructures: Water Systems, Energy Infrastructure (power plants and distribution), Transport Infrastructure and means of transportation, Communication Infrastructure, Health Services, Financial Services.
Proposals should cover: prevention, detection, response, and in case of failure, mitigation of consequences (including novel installation designs) over the life span of the infrastructure, with a view to achieving the security and resilience of all functions performed by the installations, and of neighbouring populations and the environment. They should not only address in details all aspects of both physical (e.g. bombing, plane or drone overflights and crashes, spreading of fires, floods, seismic activity, space radiations, etc.) and cyber threats and incidents, but also systemic security management issues and the combinations of physical and cyber threats and incidents, their interconnections, and their cascading effects. Innovative methods should be proposed for sharing information with the public in the vicinity of the installations, and the protection of rescue teams, security teams and monitoring teams.
Only the installations not covered in 2016 will remain eligible in 2017. A list of topics that remain eligible in 2017 will be published in due time in the section ""Topic Conditions & Documents"" for this topic on the Participant Portal.
The participation of SMEs is strongly encouraged.
In line with the EU's strategy for international cooperation in research and innovation[1] international cooperation is encouraged, and in particular with international research partners involved in ongoing discussions and workshops, with the European Commission. Legal entities established in countries not listed in General Annex A and international organisations will be eligible for funding only when the Commission deems participation of the entity essential for carrying out the action.
The outcome of the proposal is expected to lead to development up to Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 7; please see part G of the General Annexes.
Indicative budget: The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of € 8million would allow this topic to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless this does not preclude the submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
A maximum of one project will be selected per critical infrastructure listed in the “Scope” section of this topic over the 2016-2017 period.
Expected Impact:
Short term:
State-of-the-art analysis of physical/cyber detection technologies and risk scenarios, in the context of a specific critical infrastructure.
Analysis of both physical and cyber vulnerabilities of a specific critical infrastructure, including the combination of both real situation awareness and cyber situation awareness within the environment of the infrastructure.
Medium term

","Innovation action
","31 October 2017
","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Most of the biowaste produced in cities (such as garden and park waste, food and kitchen waste from households, restaurants, caterers and retail premises), as well as sewage sludge from urban wastewater treatment plants are processed into compost and biogas used for energy recovery or even landfilled without fully exploiting in a smart and innovative cascading fashion its potential as feedstock for valuable and precious compounds. New and emerging processing technologies can enable the recycling and valorisation of urban biowaste into higher-value biobased products (e.g. biobased chemicals and plastics, nutrients, human food or animal feed ingredients and proteins), thereby generating significant economic, social and environmental benefits. The successful implementation of urban biowaste recycling and valorisation technologies will require an integrated system innovation approach in a city context. Besides the technological challenges, there will be a need for public authorities to adopt new policies; changing citizens' behaviour will require social innovation initiatives, and new, profitable business models along the entire urban biowaste value chain will have to be developed.
Scope:
Proposals shall focus on an integrated system innovation approach in urban biowaste recycling and valorisation for the production of high-value biobased products, including proteins for food and feed. Proposals shall ensure the full integration of the upgraded urban biowaste value chain into the existing local waste/wastewater management schemes. Proposals shall guarantee the active participation of local and regional authorities, waste/wastewater management utilities, (biobased) industries, the scientific community, local communities and citizens. Particular attention shall also be given to: Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) of the entire urban biowaste value chain; improving logistic models taking into account changing the behaviour and participation of citizens and local communities in relation to the collection and use of this particular feedstock; increasing consumer awareness and acceptance of urban biowaste-derived products; adapting/developing business models for successful market uptake; food and feed safety aspects; regulatory aspects; and facilitating the exchange of good practices and experiences between all stakeholders.
The proposal should seek the complementarity to the projects funded under H2020 topics CIRC-05-2016[1], H2020 CIRC-02-2016-A[2] and the topic BBI 2016.D6[3].
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of the order of EUR 10 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
In the framework of SDG no 3, 6, 9, 11, 12 and 13, the EU's Bioeconomy Strategy 2012, the EU's Circular Economy Package 2015, and the FOOD 2030 Staff Working Document[4], proposals shall assess their contribution to:
Validated technical and economic viability of the proposed approaches at target TRL 7;
New business and organisational models on cities ensuring the full integration of the upgraded urban biowaste value chain into the existing local waste/wastewater management schemes;
Improved perception of citizens on urban biowaste as a local resource and their enhanced active participation in its separate collection through social innovation initiatives;
Improved consumer acceptance of urban biowaste-derived products, including food and feed ingredients;
A more sustainable and resilient protein supply chain;
Safety assessment of biobased processes and products from urban biowaste;
Reduced amount of urban biowaste that would otherwise be incinerated or landfilled, and hence reduced environmental impact (including emissions of GHG and of air pollutants and their precursors) of municipal and food waste;
Detailed assessments of specific technical, regulatory, financial, market and logistical barriers hampering the full exploitation of the urban biowaste value chain;
Evidence-based support for EU policies/targets in the biobased and circular economy, climate mitigation, sustainable growth and re-industrialisation.

","Innovation action
","03 July 2019
","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Industrial Symbiosis holds significant potential to provide major improvements in resource and energy efficiency for all energy intensive industries. Exploiting this potential could accelerate the transition to a circular economy and to renewable energy systems, reduce waste heat energy and lead to significant reduction of GHG emissions. However, Industrial Symbiosis is currently not yet widely implemented. The challenge is to tackle all technological and non-technological barriers. The full potential of industrial symbiosis could only unfold if the consequences for energy grids and adjacent infrastructures (e.g. waste heat recovery through district heating or heat integration in chemical processes, waste to energy, or waste and gaseous effluents management), as well as the regional dimension are taken into account.
Scope:
Technology based innovations should prove the potential for novel symbiotic value chains in demonstrators involving multiple industrial sectors in real industrial settings. Proposals are expected to address e.g.:
Broader symbiosis, from local and regional perspectives, with infrastructures (e.g. waste and water management infrastructure, gas networks), communities and energy grids (e.g. smart operations scheduling, district heat integration), including distributed generation and the role that symbiosis can play in fluctuating energy grids (i.e. grid services, seasonal storage, biomass or heat pumps integration);
Management of side/waste streams (through e.g. capturing, purification, concentrating, sorting, collecting, exchanging or preparation) specifically for the use as resource for other plants and companies across sectors and/or across value chains;
Process (re-)design and implementation to integrate and adapt existing processes to enhance industrial symbiosis (energy and material flow coupling, infrastructure and logistics).
Integration of information technology, including artificial intelligence, and operational technology; appropriate ICT tools (e.g. aggregation technologies) for multi-criteria decision making, for the design and the operation management of exchange streams in a dynamic production environment, advanced modelling to design and establish novel symbiotic interactions; data sharing and preservation of data confidentiality;
Assessment methodologies and KPIs to measure the performance of symbiosis, including environmental, economic and social impacts. Life cycle assessment and life cycle cost analysis should take into account existing sustainability standards (e.g. ISO 10410) and existing best practices;
Creation of an inventory of successful symbiotic relations and solutions, as well as best practices. Non-technological aspects, which may include regulatory issues, the need for redefining standards, and new business models, covering ownership, management and fair sharing of benefits, should be considered. This may entail devising collaboration strategies via contracts and platforms for cross-sectorial sharing of resources and benefits in industrial parks, clusters or distributed plants.
Clustering and cooperation with other selected projects under this cross-cutting call and other relevant projects is strongly encouraged.
Proposals submitted under this topic should include a business case and exploitation strategy, as outlined in the Introduction of this part of the Work Programme.
Activities should start at TRL 6 and achieve TRL 7 at the end of the project.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution of EUR between EUR 12 and 20 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
Several of the following impacts are expected:
Step change towards closing circular loops;
Improvement of at least 15% in energy efficiency of the targeted industrial processes, compared to the non-symbiotic scenario;
Reduction of at least 30% in total energy intensity, on the basis of full life cycle considerations;
Overall reductions in CO2 emissions of 40% compared to the non-symbiotic scenario;
Reduction in primary raw material intensity of up to 20%;
Reduction of waste generation by at least 25%;
Better understanding of relevant barriers (e.g. end of waste criteria);
Effective dissemination of major innovation outcomes to the current and next generation of employees, through the development of learning resources with flexible usability. These should be easy to integrate in existing curricula and modules for undergraduate level and lifelong learning programmes;
The environmental gains in absolute figures, and weighted against EU and global environmental footprints, should be demonstrated;
In addition, the replication potential should also be be assessed.
Relevant indicators and metrics, with baseline values, should be stated clearly in the proposal.

Disruptions in the operation of our countries’ infrastructure may put at risk the functioning of our societies and their economies. Such disruptions may result from many kinds of hazards and physical and/or cyber-attacks on installations and systems. Recent events demonstrate the increased interconnection among the impact of hazards, of the two kinds of attacks and, conversely, the usefulness for operators to combine cyber and physical security-solutions to protect installations of the critical infrastructure of Europe: A comprehensive, yet installation-specific approach is needed to secure the integrity of existing or future, public or private, connected and interdependent installations. Since the global financial crisis has imposed unprecedented budgetary restrictions on both the public and private sectors, new security solutions must be more efficient and cost-effective than the ones currently available.
Scope:
Proposals should focus on one of the following critical infrastructures: Water Systems, Energy Infrastructure (power plants and distribution), Transport Infrastructure and means of transportation, Communication Infrastructure, Health Services, Financial Services.
Proposals should cover: prevention, detection, response, and in case of failure, mitigation of consequences (including novel installation designs) over the life span of the infrastructure, with a view to achieving the security and resilience of all functions performed by the installations, and of neighbouring populations and the environment. They should not only address in details all aspects of both physical (e.g. bombing, plane or drone overflights and crashes, spreading of fires, floods, seismic activity, space radiations, etc.) and cyber threats and incidents, but also systemic security management issues and the combinations of physical and cyber threats and incidents, their interconnections, and their cascading effects. Innovative methods should be proposed for sharing information with the public in the vicinity of the installations, and the protection of rescue teams, security teams and monitoring teams.
Only the installations not covered in 2016 will remain eligible in 2017. A list of topics that remain eligible in 2017 will be published in due time in the section ""Topic Conditions & Documents"" for this topic on the Participant Portal.
The participation of SMEs is strongly encouraged.
In line with the EU's strategy for international cooperation in research and innovation[1] international cooperation is encouraged, and in particular with international research partners involved in ongoing discussions and workshops, with the European Commission. Legal entities established in countries not listed in General Annex A and international organisations will be eligible for funding only when the Commission deems participation of the entity essential for carrying out the action.
The outcome of the proposal is expected to lead to development up to Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 7; please see part G of the General Annexes.
Indicative budget: The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of € 8million would allow this topic to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless this does not preclude the submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
A maximum of one project will be selected per critical infrastructure listed in the “Scope” section of this topic over the 2016-2017 period.

","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Facilitating open innovation would ensure that ideas and knowledge are transformed into socio-economic value for European citizens. An important market failure in Europe is that it has an abundance of unexploited ideas and research results with considerable innovation potential, which are not being brought to the markets.
Some of the main issues are linked to the difficulty in matching demand and supply of ideas due to the great amount of information available and to the difficulties in communicating it. The latter can be aggravated by the lack of absorptive capacity and the difficulty of certain actors to formulate a demand for innovative ideas or to adopt/adapt existing ones.
In open innovation and collaborative innovation projects it is more difficult to find appropriate sources of funding, since investors might fail to identify the potential of such projects, the actors involved and they might perceive an increased level of risk stemming from such configurations.
Scope:
Experimenting mechanisms to facilitate the match between supply and demand for innovative ideas, as well as the development of absorptive capacities within businesses and other knowledge users. Addressing such issues would facilitate knowledge co-creation among actors that better understand each other's needs and language.
The pilots need to address at least two of the following elements of the innovation eco-system:
Designing and piloting systematic ways of connecting innovation systems across Europe, so that knowledge flows from one to the other easily and meaningfully. One way of achieving this could be by facilitating human capital mobility and therefore the absorptive capacities of the parties involved. This could include ideas such as ""Innovation Human Capital Vouchers"" aimed at stimulating SMEs to contact higher education institutes in order to find a solution to their problems;
Focus on the skills and capabilities of businesses to tap into the European knowledge-base, by developing and piloting specific skills-sets that allows for an effective monitoring of new relevant knowledge, as well as skills that allow a better formulation of a demand for innovative solutions fit for the companies' needs (facilitating interaction between business and academia and/or between businesses);
Design and pilot public/private funding mechanisms aiming at increasing private funding participation in collaborative innovation projects, contributing to bring innovative ideas to the market. Such mechanisms could build on or combine existing mechanisms;
Piloting other concrete measures favouring collaborative forms of innovation from a demand-side point of view (i.e. with a focus on businesses needs).
All activities must be concrete experiments or pilots with quantifiable results. All piloted actions will be ready for replication and scale-up.
Activities that fall out of the scope of this call include: research activities, mapping of existing initiatives, collections of best practices, etc.
Applicants could include partners from different sectors, such as knowledge transfer offices, regional development agencies, business associations, business accelerators, networks bringing together businesses and academia, innovation hubs, innovation centres, investment funds, venture capital, crowdfunding platforms, research and technology organisations etc.
The action should take into account and coordinate with, where appropriate, with other EU and national initiatives in the field, such as those supported in the context of Erasmus+ Knowledge Alliances.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU in the order of EUR 2.5 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. This does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
This action allows for the provision of financial support to third parties in line with the conditions set out in Part K of the General Annexes to the Work Programme.
Expected Impact:
It is expected that by better linking demand and supply of ideas and knowledge through new collaborative models, the projects will contribute in the medium term to an increase of innovation and competitiveness in Europe. In addition, starting from in the short to medium term, they will promote socio-economic benefits for European citizens, through the co-creation of solutions adapted to their needs, enabled by increasing the capacity of companies to absorb information. In the long term, due to the replication and scale up potential that the pilots will demonstrate, this will contribute to creating a European innovation ecosystem able to transform ideas and knowledge into socio-economic value for the European citizens.
The mechanisms and pilots supported by this topic will improve the flow of information though collaborative models with increased business participation. By strengthening business innovation through empowering the innovators to screen, identify and formulate a demand for relevant information, as well as increasing their capacity to absorb it and turn it into value, the projects will contribute to boosting innovation across Europe.

","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
As societal challenges are growing more complex and interlinked, public policy innovation and experimentation, using ICT can improve the effectiveness, efficiency and the quality decisions in the public sector. Effective and reliable policies need to consider the available data (including its structure and topology) and evidence to ensure accurate and meaningful information. Big data offers many opportunities; using data analytics to generate new insights, increasing predictive power and identifying unexpected patterns and relationships that can help inform policy making. For instance data analytics tools can also help public authorities to better detect and evidence patterns of non-compliance in many policy areas affecting the health, the safety and the welfare of citizens in the internal market of goods, services and persons. Effective processing power and expertise are widely used in the retail and commercial sector, the challenge is to create effective resources to make this available to governments, allowing policy choices to become more evidence-based and analytical.
In addition, open policy-making and the integration of the citizens’ perspective through the effective engagement of relevant social actors - for example over online platforms or by crowd-sourcing - can potentially generate vast amounts of data, which can allow policy options to become more informed. Furthermore, open policy-making can support a participatory, open and collaborative government vision. Besides simulations, perceptions data pose a further promising source of information. Conducted on a regular basis, e.g. by the Eurobarometer, identifying perceived bottlenecks in relation to policy reforms as well as assessing the perceived performance of past reforms becomes feasible; in some cases these official statistics may be complemented by new sources of data. Taken together, this may lead to developing second generation data tools and assessment for more targeted policy design. It also offers opportunities for different communities to take ownership of the use and analysis of data in an age where they are at risk of being alienated by too much information. In addition, policy implementation can significantly benefit from efficient enforcement and monitoring tools that are informed by data from various sources.
Scope:
In order to enable governments - at all levels - to benefit from the availability of relevant data and thereby introduce and implement effective policies, new or improved methods and tools are needed to support and establish new types of evidence-informed policy design and implementation and to facilitate the interpretation of big data for public communication, including new outcome-based. For public administrations to experiment with the possibilities offered by big data – for example through policy modelling, monitoring, enforcing, simulation, testing, analysis and policy compliance – there is a need to thoroughly understand the legal frameworks and to take into account sociological, cultural, political, legal and economic as well as behavioural aspects. Proposals should also elaborate on the relationship between evidence-based policy-making and citizens’ participation, integrating the analysis of participatory elements.
a) Research and Innovation Actions
Proposals need to address several of the following aspects:
Methodological development for using big data in policy development, examining the extent to which policy-making structures and systems are ready to absorb and analyse big data;
Critical interdisciplinary assessment of the economic, political, epistemological, ethical and legal premises and implications of big data practices (including algorithmic governance, smart cities, etc.), allowing for the reflection on the potential benefits and risks;
Develop scalable and transferable methods and re-usable tools for compilation, analysis and visualisation of data, including relevant open, official or certified data;
Develop scalable and transferable methods and re-usable tools for mining, compilation, analysis and visualisation of data from any source, including data related to social dynamics and behaviour;
Develop scalable and transferable methods and re-usable tools for data curation, meta-data schemes, data linking or for reconciliation of multiple data sets to render coherent narratives;
Understanding the implications of the increasing materiality of data with the development of the Internet of Things and its implications for the sustainability of government’s effective use of big data for improved policy making in the longer term;
Develop scalable and transferable methods and re-usable tools for opinion-mining of large data sets in order to avoid the situation that the bigger the data, the less clear how they have been produced;
Develop scalable and transferable methods and re-usable tools for policy modelling and simulation to improve the predicative analysis capacity of governments;
Develop scalable and transferable methods and re-usable tools for iterative policy design and implementation (e.g. through the greater use of randomised controlled trials based on behavioural science);
Develop scalable and transferable methods and re-usable tools for policy enforcement and compliance monitoring tools.
Proposals should apply their methodology to policy areas addressing societal challenges (e.g. environment, migration, radicalisation, inequalities, unemployment, internal market obstacles to the free movement of persons, goods and services). When using open and big data in order to enlarge the evidence base for effective policy-making, principles such as independence, quality, coherence and consistency, confidentiality, impartiality and objectivity as well as representativeness and extrapolation to meaningful populations need to be considered. Data protection, ethical and privacy issues will also have to be addressed as well as ethical issues around storage, use and re-use of data. Application and improvement of existing quantitative tools is preferable. Sociological as well as behavioural science approaches are encouraged, especially where they aim to develop a deeper understanding of how public policy and services interact with citizens. If relevant, proposals also need to analyse the suitability of the proposed software.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 4 and 5 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
b) Coordination and Support Action[1]
The activities should aim at encouraging networking of relevant stakeholders and teams working in the area of data-driven policy-making and policy-modelling and to support constituency building. Following an assessment of the needs of public administrations, the multidisciplinary network will identify methods, tools, technologies and applications for their implementation in the public sector, taking into consideration activities also undertaken outside the European Union and considering specificities relevant to different policy domains of public activity. The activities will conclude with the outlining of a roadmap for future research directions.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU in the order of EUR 0.5 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. This does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
Proposals need to demonstrate the impact to be achieved after the project phase, inter alia, in terms of improved public policy effectiveness, efficiency gains, precision gains, improved consistency, and reliance on evidence leading to increased policy compliance as well as in terms of the democratic dimension, such as greater transparency, good governance, increased trust in and the perceived legitimacy of government. Additional impact may be increased accessibility to the non-governmental players.

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
The growing attention given to research and innovation over the past decades has resulted in increased amounts of public funding being channelled to research and innovation, but also to a variety of policies and funding programmes being put in place in Europe, in order to maximise the quality and impact of this funding.
These policies have been wide in scope, ranging from basic research all the way up to supporting the market introduction of innovation and used a variety of instruments, oriented not only towards the production of knowledge and innovation, but also towards optimising the processes by which innovations are generated (including Co-Creation).
Investments in R&I must be smart and efficient and obtain the most value for every euro invested. This requires clear strategies for investing in R&I coupled with quality R&I programmes and strong institutions capable of implementing these programmes in close connection with the business sector and other stakeholders such as civil society. In addition, there is a clear need to improve the overall framework conditions for transforming R&I investments into tangible results, whether as new products or services or in terms of less tangible impacts such as improvements in the quality of life or inclusion.
The challenge for policy makers is to design policies and programmes with targeted funding to address well identified bottlenecks and which are adapted to the specific context of the research and innovation system in question. This is key to improving the efficiency of the European research and innovation system as a whole, as was stressed by the Commission in its Communication on 'Research and innovation as sources of renewed growth'. [1]
Designing such policies and programmes requires a sound evidence base around the performance of research and innovation systems, the impact of research and innovation policies, the impact of research and innovation on economic growth, job creation and societal progress, and on the way in which public funding and policies can influence performance and impact. The Commission regularly publishes authoritative reports (e.g. the Innovation Union Scoreboard and the Innovation Union Competitiveness Report) which contribute to this evidence base, but given the increasing importance of research and innovation and recent evolutions in this field, the analysis regarding these issues needs to become more sophisticated.
Scope:
Research will focus on establishing new methodologies for assessing the performance and impact of research and innovation and the ways in which public policies and funding can influence these. This should focus in particular on the following aspects:
(2016) Integration of research and innovation in macro-economic models: fiscal policies are often supported by macro-economic models to make an ex-ante assessment of the impact of budgetary measures and structural reforms. This includes dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) models, macro-sectoral models and econometric modelling. A common shortcoming of these macro-economic models is that they typically do not account for the long-term benefits of public research and innovation investments and policies, fail to take full account of the quality of these investments, or do so only in a limited manner. Projects should focus on developing modelling approaches which go beyond the current state-of-the-art by incorporating for instance: the distinction between public and private research sectors and the different ways in which public funding and policies can incentivise increased activity and quality in these sectors; the fact that quality of research and innovation is not homogenous (including at sectoral level) or the influence public policies can have on the quantity and quality of the stock of highly skilled people, on the link between human capital and the production and use of knowledge, on the productivity of knowledge production or on spill-over and technology diffusion mechanisms;
(2016) Improving the parameterisation of the aforementioned models: in addition to developing novel modelling approaches, further work is also needed on empirically determining the underlying parameters (elasticity factors) used in the aforementioned models and which link for instance the human capital stock to knowledge production, the production, diffusion and use of knowledge to innovation or which quantify the effect public policies have on these parameters;
(2017) New indicators for assessing research and innovation performance: projects should focus on developing and applying new indicators for assessing the performance of distinct elements of the research and innovation system, including the impact of research and innovation policies. These should go beyond the typical bibliometric and patenting indicators, as these only offer a limited view, in particular in an evolving landscape in which for instance open access mechanisms, social media, social innovation people mobility assume an increasing role. Such new indicators should allow policy makers to assess in a broader and more comprehensive way evolutions in performance and how these are linked to policy reforms;
(2017) Determining the societal impact of research and innovation funding: policy makers need to justify research and innovation spending by demonstrating the impact it has in terms of broader societal benefits. Projects should develop and test new ways to assess the societal impact of public funding allocated to research and innovation, for instance by building on examples of quantitative approaches (such as the USA's Star Metrics initiative or the European SIMPATIC project) or could develop qualitative approaches . Projects should take a broad approach and go beyond evaluating impacts in terms of productivity growth, economic growth and job creation, by also assessing the impact of public funding on tackling major societal challenges such as those defined in Horizon 2020.
Projects to be funded on the 2016 budget should address either the first or second issue described above or can combine them in one project. Projects to be funded on the 2017 budget should address either the third or fourth issue described above or can combine them in one project.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 1 and 1.5 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. This does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
Depending on the aspect addressed, and in line with the scope above, projects are expected to respectively deliver the following impact:
The development of models which provide a realistic assessment of the variety of ways in which research and innovation activities transmit into outputs and impact and of the ways in which public funding and policies can influence this transmission;
An empirical determination of realistic values for the underlying parameters used in the models;
A monitoring of research and innovation performance which captures the broader spectrum of ways in which research and innovation activities translate into outputs and impact, in which knowledge circulates between public and private sectors and internationally or through which quality of research and innovation can be assessed;
A reliable assessment of the societal benefits generated by public funding for research and innovation, not only in terms of productivity growth, economic growth and job creation, but also the impact it has on tackling major societal challenges.

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Research and innovation dynamics are increasingly being influenced by the development of interactions among all stakeholders (""quadruple helix"" approach). More actors are involved in knowledge creation and the innovation process. Universities and research institutions collaborate with business enterprises, hospitals, local municipalities, administrations for public services and citizen organisations. At the same time, the research and innovation process is changing with the transition towards open science and open innovation. The focus is increasingly on developing, testing and rolling out solutions to societal challenges for the benefit of citizens and local jobs. Since 2014, the EU has boosted its support to this dynamics through new funding instruments and modalities, incl. smart specialisation strategies. This show the way for new hot-spots of knowledge production and co-creation in Europe.
However, information and data on this new research and innovation dynamics is relatively unknown and fragmented. Local and regional actors are often not aware of which relevant and complementary knowledge, and possible project partners, can be found in other places in Europe. And national and European policy makers do not have the overview of hot spots in Europe. This information would enable them to refine their policies and funding instruments, improving the effectiveness and efficiency of national and European knowledge systems.
Scope:
The aim of a European map of knowledge co-creation is to create a methodology and web-based platform that presents data on institutional, regional and national knowledge co-creation hot-spots. The resulting maps will enable web-based search for co-creation and knowledge production hot spots addressing societal challenges or Key Enabling Technologies. The methodology will make use of state of the art of all available data sets (e.g. webometrics, bibliometrics, patent data, EU-funded collaboration, institutional data) and methods for linking them, ensuring synergies and avoiding overlaps, also taking into account social sciences and humanities and big data. It will also be flexible enough to connect to existing and complementary data systems with more traditional input and output indicators on Higher Education Institutions (HEI) and Public Research Organizations.
The funding will enable methodological developments and a European-wide pilot mapping of knowledge production, co-creation and cooperation. As a first stage, all institutions actively involved in knowledge production, co-creation and cooperation in Europe will be identified. In parallel, a common terminology will be established corresponding to specific societal challenges or technologies. The platform should have an interactive graphic interface to allow users to quickly parameter their request and obtain European maps of knowledge production, co-creation and cooperation in a specific societal challenge or technology at regional and local level.
The platform shall be fully compliant with all existing definitional standards in the field of S&T and be inter-operable and scalable, from an IT point of view.
The Union shall support the initial development of the Map. The Union therefore asks proposers to suggest a convincing, sustainable, commercially viable business model for the operation and further development of the Map in the absence of follow-up support from the Union.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU in order of EUR 2 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. This does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
The proposed Map of knowledge co-creation shall provide a more effective basis for evidence-based policy making in the EU, through giving a novel insight to the driving forces bringing about knowledge production, co-creation and cooperation for societal challenges or key enabling technologies. It will also allow actors at local and regional level to identify possible partners and peers in other countries in Europe. The map crosses over disciplines and territories and go beyond the current state of the art to identify and assess the complete range of parameters linked to measuring actors, and hot-spots addressing different challenges. It fully capitalise on recent developments in the availability of data and in computational techniques. In such a way, it shall enrich the knowledge base upon which research investment decisions are taken and harness the full power of data visualisation tools by way of collecting large datasets and presenting them in a clear and understandable way, thus allowing essential policy insights quickly, in a flexible manner, and at a reasonable cost.

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
The growing attention given to research and innovation over the past decades has resulted in increased amounts of public funding being channelled to research and innovation, but also to a variety of policies and funding programmes being put in place in Europe, in order to maximise the quality and impact of this funding.
These policies have been wide in scope, ranging from basic research all the way up to supporting the market introduction of innovation and used a variety of instruments, oriented not only towards the production of knowledge and innovation, but also towards optimising the processes by which innovations are generated (including Co-Creation).
Investments in R&I must be smart and efficient and obtain the most value for every euro invested. This requires clear strategies for investing in R&I coupled with quality R&I programmes and strong institutions capable of implementing these programmes in close connection with the business sector and other stakeholders such as civil society. In addition, there is a clear need to improve the overall framework conditions for transforming R&I investments into tangible results, whether as new products or services or in terms of less tangible impacts such as improvements in the quality of life or inclusion.
The challenge for policy makers is to design policies and programmes with targeted funding to address well identified bottlenecks and which are adapted to the specific context of the research and innovation system in question. This is key to improving the efficiency of the European research and innovation system as a whole, as was stressed by the Commission in its Communication on 'Research and innovation as sources of renewed growth'. [1]
Designing such policies and programmes requires a sound evidence base around the performance of research and innovation systems, the impact of research and innovation policies, the impact of research and innovation on economic growth, job creation and societal progress, and on the way in which public funding and policies can influence performance and impact. The Commission regularly publishes authoritative reports (e.g. the Innovation Union Scoreboard and the Innovation Union Competitiveness Report) which contribute to this evidence base, but given the increasing importance of research and innovation and recent evolutions in this field, the analysis regarding these issues needs to become more sophisticated.

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Over the past decades, the insight has grown among national, European and international policymakers that policy action cannot be solely guided by reference to gross domestic product and its growth without integrating intangible investment, social and environmental dimensions, individual well-being and qualitative dimensions in the GDP. The changing characteristics of economies and societies in Europe require inclusion of multiple dimensions, including gender and age, new measurement and data for developing new policy for economic growth and well-being.
European growth prospects, job creation and well-being of citizens largely depend on economically successful innovations which address global and EU challenges and create new opportunities for firms. However, the importance of capital stock developments and investments, as well as labour skills, at a detailed industry level and for all types of tangible and intangible assets has not been fully integrated into the analysis of EU innovation and growth performances mainly due to data issues. Better measurement of tangible and intangible investments together with labour skills, in existing categories as well as inclusion of potentially relevant asset categories outside the current asset boundary (such as economic competences, organisational capital, co-creation, skills, marketing assets, firm specific human capital investments, culture and arts) – by taking gender and age into account - would improve the understanding about growth in knowledge-based, globalised and connected economies. Moreover, innovation driven growth strategies require a better understanding on the roles of services (including business services) and the use of ICT and internet at industry level. Equally vital for new growth strategies is a better understanding of the complementarities of firms' investments in global value added chains and the creation of new dynamic market industries.
Europe needs to understand and analyse the changing frame of references for the evaluation of the state and development of societies. Official statistics need to be modernised to provide a more complete picture through the incorporation of new metrics, based on new sources and data collection methods, in coherent frameworks delivering consistent evidences and narratives to policymakers. New sources (including social media) offer unparalleled opportunities to elicit information on welfare, wellbeing and societal progress by other means than traditional sample surveys and require the development of modern, innovative methods for official statistics. With all strata of the population being in scope, methodologically sound official statistics ensure that for e.g. a “silent majority” (those who do not tweet) or marginalised minorities (those who for e.g., lack bank accounts and credit cards and hence leave no trace in certain electronic systems) remain visible to policymakers when innovative, non-traditional sources are used to measure progress. The protection of individual data is furthermore a concern that should be taken into account.
Scope:
a) Research and innovation actions
Research aims to improve the availability and quality in the data on tangible and intangible investments, capital stock and the composition of labour inputs at industry level and/or firm level which in longer perspective qualifies for the endorsement from official statistics.
Compilation of data on tangible and intangible investment categories within the existing asset boundary of the national accounts standards (SNA 2008/ESA 2010) need to be targeted and supplemented with national sources and other types of calculations. Creating new data for potentially relevant asset categories outside the current asset boundary at a detailed industry level need statistical work together with implementing strategies and novel approaches to minimise cost and burden of compiling. Piloting and proof of concepts can be useful. All efforts to improve data availability and quality need to be consistent with the current statistical classification of economic activities (NACE Rev.2), National Accounts concepts, methodologies and quality criteria. It is important to use internationally harmonized official source statistics. Future extensions of official statistics can benefit from the already existing work on tangible and intangible capital stocks and labour input outside the official statistical systems by improving their quality in line with statistical quality criteria. It is essential to work out a strategy in which the statistical community cooperates with the economic and other social sciences communities to integrate the improved and/or newly created data into established official statistics to guarantee their lasting reproducibility.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU in the order of EUR 2 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. This does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
b) Coordination and Support Action[1]
The coordination and support action should focus on the incorporation and alignment of new, possibly unofficial and unstructured, sources with established official statistics. It should build on the rich body of results in the alternative growth approaches, social, environmental and sustainable indicators, new consumption models and “Beyond GDP” domain – in consistency with National Accounts - covering both novel domains and non-traditional sources as well as innovative data collection approaches. It should incorporate a strong statistical methodological component focusing on obtaining consistency, representativity/social inclusion (in particular when innovative data collection methods are used) and measures of uncertainty. Piloting and proof of concept should be at the forefront. Disaggregation of statistics - geographically, or by other domains (e.g. identifying vulnerable population groups) - to provide greater insights and providing evidence allowing more focused policy decisions should be covered, as should metadata and other aspects of quality of statistics. At the same time data protection concerns should be addressed.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU in the order of EUR 1 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. This does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
Better data and official statistics should improve our understanding about the changing nature of overall investment and growth dynamism in Europe. Widening of the concept of investment should bring insights for the European growth strategy and reveal cross-country differences in growth and productivity performances taking into account the role of tangible and intangible capital in the modernisation and competitiveness of EU industries and services. Moreover, through the investigation of the practical applicability of new sources, frameworks and methods for official statistics across a wide range of aspects regarding social and sustainable progress will provide a coherent framework of reliable evidence to the benefit of society. Public statistics and measurements being more explorative and future-orientated should provide new innovative policy support frameworks in ""Beyond GDP"" perspective.

Specific challenge: Space endeavours bear a significant potential of inspiration and motivation for the younger generations. Positive exposure to and experiences in the space domain can contribute moreover to building long-term partnerships between peoples from different cultural backgrounds and countries inside and outside Europe. The challenge is to design and run sustainable outreach activities which can act as catalysers, motivating pupils and students at different ages and education levels. Proposals which could be implemented across different cultures, inside and outside Europe, would be considered.
Scope: One of the main obstacles for the development and sustainability of the European space industrial fabric (and the delivery of cutting-edge scientific achievements) is the lack of scientists, engineers and technicians with specific interest on the area of space research and development.
The main delivery of the action should be an initiative capable of attracting the interest of a significant number of students towards space, while creating at the same time a relevant impact outside the targeted population in terms of news coverage, social-media interest, stakeholders’ involvement, etc.
The key advancements of the European space initiatives (Seventh Framework Programme-Horizon 2020 projects, Copernicus and Galileo) should be given a privileged position in the proposal, but the main objective should remain attracting the interest of students, mainly European, for space exploration science and technology.
Proposals should take into account similar activities of ESA and national education programmes. They could focus in the context of the classroom or outside the normal classroom environment, including contests.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 1 and 2 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected impact: The expected impact as a whole is developing and testing certain tools and mechanisms for children and/or teenagers (and potentially teachers) to know more about space science and technology and the European initiatives in this field. The testing of tools should pay special attention to potential differentiated results in terms of gender or socioeconomic status.
By the end of the action the initiative should have proven its capacity to:
         Reach out to a significant number of students among the target group and stimulate an active response among a significant number of them.
         Achieve a significant coverage by media and attention by stakeholders.
         Potentially, being able to track and estimate the results of the action, sampling the numbers of students involved and the numbers of students that opt for a technical career related to space when compared to the general population of students in their cohorts.

Recent conclusions of the Council of the European Union recognised cultural heritage as a ""resource for a sustainable Europe"" and highlighted that ""participatory governance of cultural heritage offers opportunities to foster democratic participation, sustainability and social cohesion and to face the social, political and demographic challenges"" in Europe.[1] The European Commission has also highlighted that the contribution of cultural heritage to economic growth and social cohesion is undervalued in spite of growing scientific evidence, and called for an integrated approach to cultural heritage for Europe.[2] It is recognised that cultural heritage is a shared resource for everyone and set the objective of continuing to develop more participative interpretation and governance models that are better suited to the contemporary European context, through greater involvement of the private sector and civil society. Europe's dense network of cultural institutions needs to adapt to changing societal, demographic and economic circumstances. Greater understanding is needed on how the different approaches to participatory governance work in this diverse sector including governance models, consideration of and access to different types of heritage, intergenerational equity etc. It is thus of paramount importance for urban and rural development, tourism, education, creative industries and cultural heritage professionals to understand how to integrate European tangible and intangible cultural heritage into sustainable development, hence the crucial role of social and inclusive innovation. This will also help to promote innovative ways in which to manage increasing flows of EU and non-EU tourists, which are currently largely limited to a number of urban destinations only (""theme park Europe"").
Scope:
a) Research and Innovation Actions
Research under this topic will critically assess the current state of cultural institutions and investigate new ways to develop the role of European culture ministries, cultural institutions and their networks as cultural service providers and hubs of social innovation. It should take into account recent international, European and national research results and best practices. It should have wide European geographic coverage and stakeholder involvement from citizens and cultural institutions that enables innovative research, case studies, pilot actions and smooth uptake of research results. The research should investigate innovative ways in which cultural institutions can engage with younger and more mature audiences, with minority, migrant or socially disadvantaged groups and include them in their governance - and how local communities organise themselves in order to co-create a better use of the local heritage. It should look into the challenges faced by cultural institutions with regard to the necessity to balance needs for managing material collections and opening culture and cultural heritage to new audiences. Research should also investigate the issue of how to combine traditional cultural services with innovative new cultural or social services like adult or lifelong learning, career support, access to and assistance to digital services and e-administrations flexible work arrangement. The gender dimension of these issues should be also considered. The role and potential of enhanced European and international cooperation and networking of culture ministries, cultural departments of local governments and cultural institutions (from traveling artefacts and exhibits to joint curatorial work and other types of sharing resources, expertise and best practices) should also be addressed. The proposed research will draw on comparative perspectives.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU in the order of EUR 2.5 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. This does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
b) Coordination and Support Action[3]
A social platform will bring together relevant heritage stakeholders’ representatives from research communities, heritage practitioners from public or private cultural institutions (heritage sites, libraries, archives, museums, and other public or private collections) and organisations (NGOs, associations), as well as policy-makers at European, national, regional or local levels. For improving the excellence of European heritage management and related policy making the platform should also harness the potential of networking among the growing number of European cultural heritage and cultural studies departments at higher education and research institutions.
Based on a focussed, critical mapping of existing research and practice, the objective of the social platform is to develop an understanding of the challenges and opportunities for research and innovation in the participatory preservation, (re)use and management of cultural heritage. The platform should pay particular attention to the sustainability and employment dimensions of new approaches to cultural heritage, taking into account the issues of data collection and measurement. The platform will map and share European and extra-European best practices, identify emerging new European heritage communities, evaluate bottlenecks and opportunities in the financial and legal environment and create new European networks around the participative preservation, (re)use and management of cultural heritage.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU in the order of EUR 1.5 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. This does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
The actions will form the basis for new institutional strategies to engage new audiences and communities and to combine culture, informal culture and cultural heritage demonstration and preservation with innovative ways of cultural transmission and creative re-use. The findings will help culture ministries, cultural institutions and other relevant actors to reinvent and modernise their policies and their roles as centres of culture, cultural heritage, information, learning and gathering. Results will give guidance on how to promote European culture and further democratise access to it in a way that enables mutual and intercultural understanding. In addition to new academic results, the activities will also provide analytical tools or toolkits, description of best practices and policy recommendations that can facilitate the direct uptake of research and other insights by stakeholders.

","13 September 2017","Specific Challenge:
This RIA complements previous and on-going EU research on cultural heritage in rural, mountainous and urban settings. European coastal and maritime regions have - over several millennia - developed a rich, multi-layered and varied cultural heritage. At the crossroads of different types of contacts of European peoples with each other and with other regions of the world (from commerce to conquest, from cultural exchange to mass tourism) they represent an extremely rich tangible heritage (coastal towns and villages, submerged landscapes and underwater artefacts, harbours, dams, light houses, arsenals, buildings of the fishing and marine industry, boat builders, etc.). As a result of a combination of natural landscapes and human ingeniousness, including unique types of transcultural communication and ethnic diversity, specific coastal cultural landscapes emerged on the shores and sea beds of Europe. This tangible heritage is intimately embedded into the multiple layers of intangible heritage, from myths to daily practices, languages, traditions and crafts of local cultures of communities of sailors, fishermen, boat builders, merchants, etc. Today, coastal cultural landscapes are very much exposed to environmental challenges such as climate change (rising sea levels), other forms of pollution, dense or scattered urbanisation, tourism pressure, the fundamental transformation of the European fishing industry due to over-exploitation of fish stocks and erratic policies of sea or shore conservation at national level. With several coastal zones being among the densest populated areas, mixed metropolitan coastal landscapes have emerged around historic port cities posing new challenges for conservation, management and transmission of existing tangible and intangible values. Against this backdrop, research should provide local communities and local, national and European policy-makers with a coherent framework for risk assessment and sustainable management of European coastal cultural heritage in a way that involves local stakeholders.
Scope:
The research will aim at providing a comprehensive framework for the preservation of European coastal and maritime cultural landscapes. It should be geographically balanced and cover different types of European coastal and maritime cultural landscapes taking into account various historical backgrounds and the current state of these regions, as they range from the most popular destinations of mass tourism to the most peripheral regions of Europe. The research - multidisciplinary to the extent required by its inherent and explicit research approach - might combine approaches and methodologies of cultural heritage preservation, social sciences and humanities, spatial and environmental sciences. It will cover both tangible and related intangible cultural heritage in order to provide a full picture of the societal importance of the cultural heritage of the landscapes under investigation. The research should involve and further develop networks of scholars, local stakeholders and policy makers. It will contribute to European efforts to promote evidence-based research on the impact of participatory approaches in cultural heritage policies and governance, as suggested by the Council of the European Union's conclusions on participatory governance of cultural heritage (2014/C 463/01). In addition, it will contribute to a better implementation of European policies on coastal zones and maritime areas, referring both to the 'Integrated Coastal Zone Management ICZM' ('Recommendation concerning the 'Integrated Coastal Zone Management' (2002/413/EC)) and to the 'Establishing a framework for maritime spatial planning' (Directive 2014/89/EU), thus providing evidence on how to link environmental and cultural policies.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU in the order of EUR 2.5 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. This does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
As a result of its reasonably multidisciplinary approach and mapping efforts, the research will significantly deepen knowledge on the cultural heritage of European coastal and maritime regions. It will lay the basis of a comprehensive framework for the documentation and sustainable management and preservation of European coastal and maritime cultural landscapes taking into account cultural, environmental, spatial and broader societal aspects. The research will provide policy advice and create networks, concepts and tools on how to maintain and preserve this rich and diverse element of the European cultural heritage based on stakeholder involvement and participatory governance. Case studies and tailor-made pilot projects of the research will allow putting in practice the proposed new tools, concepts and methodologies. Special attention will be given to the preservation and exploitation of both tangible and related intangible cultural heritage like traditional skills and know-how embodied in practices and corresponding knowledge systems. The project(s) will also explore the possibilities of new, sustainable, cultural heritage-related career and business opportunities in the studied regions.

ICT changes the way cultural digital resources are created, disseminated, preserved and (re)used. It empowers different types of users to engage with cultural digital resources, for example through web discovery interfaces representing a wealth of information from collections (archives, scientific collection, museums, art galleries, visual arts etc.) enabling their re-use and re-purposing according to users' needs and inputs. The Virtual Museum (VM) is not a real museum transposed to the web, nor an archive or a database of virtual digital assets but a provider of information on top of being an exhibition room. VM provide opportunities for people to access digital content before, during and after a visit in a range of digital ‘encounters’. Virtual museum is technologically demanding especially in terms of virtual and augmented reality and storytelling authoring tools which must covers various types of digital creations including virtual reality and 3D experiences, located online, in museums or on heritage sites. The challenge will be to give further emphasis on improving access, establishing meaningful narratives for collections and displays and story-led interpretation by the development of VM. It will also address the fundamental issues that are required to make this happen e.g. image rights, licencing and the ability of museums to support new ICT technology.
The emergence of new social paradigms in the area of European Heritage induce the creation of specific social platforms that will encourage an active participation of a large number of stakeholders aiming at a better understanding of the European cultural heritage. Moreover it should facilitate and support a better understanding of the past to better build our future. The challenge is to support the multidisciplinary awareness needed for providing a comprehensive framework for the accessibility, preservation, participatory and sustainable management of cultural resources and assets, based on a holistic, social understanding of European culture and cultural heritage. This challenge will contribute to the debate over these issues and opportunities by facilitating an open dialogue on how technological changes, new business models and scientific progress impact and accelerate developments, including social change, determine policy changes, and support new investments (both private and public) involving diverse actors with different stakes and agendas.
Researching digital cultural heritage is of key, long-term importance to Europe in order to form a robust knowledge base on how cultural heritage may develop in the 21st century. This will enable creative and innovative partnerships between museums, creative industries and public-domain areas such as education with transfer value to other socio-cultural areas and will advance strategies for heritage institutions, including museums, to harness transversal citizen resources and thus enhance their benefit to wider society.
Scope:
a) Research and Innovation Actions
European cultural heritage is being radically transformed with the wide adoption of digital media used for engagement, participation and inclusion. Researching these transformations encompass the engagements of citizens in their own formation of heritage and the options for heritage institutions to capitalize on the new forms of communication and interaction.
The real potentiality of a virtual museum is in the creation of a personalized, immersive, interactive ways to enhance our understanding of the world around us. The audio-visual narrative is one of the best means to effectively communicate about objects in a museum to the ordinary visitor. Therefore, actions will focus on the development of highly innovative technologies, methods and ICT tools to significantly improve the ‘digital encounter’ including quality of images, sonic narratives, the display and interactivity with digital objects. Besides, actions should research and create new ways of personalised storytelling, interactivity and adaptive guidance, bridging the physical and the digital world. The technology resulting from the research should be validated in real life environments. During test and validation phases, due attention has to be paid to scalability, portability, transmedia and interoperability of the technologies proposed and the support needed when implemented. Furthermore, social media tools should be integrated into the VM platform in order to facilitate exchange of information among users.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU in the order of EUR 2.5 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. This does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
b) Coordination and Support Action[1]
The scope of this action is to develop and maintain a sustainable platform engaging a large number of key actors, stakeholders and communities of practices on how to improve the collaboration and comprehension among the entire community, in order to build up a common roadmap for future activities and explore how these new encounters can be evaluated to understand the models. The platform should engage - and be open to all - practitioners and stakeholders wishing to contribute to decision making processes, agree on objectives and priorities, share experiences, policies and practices. Partnership and collaboration between public and private stakeholders should be encouraged. The platform will concretise its action through the organisation of workshops, conferences or any other awareness-raising actions.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution of EUR 1 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. This does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
Virtual Museums and Social Platform are accessible for everyone, breaking the restrictions of geography and time. VM & SP will help to increase European citizens' curiosity for art and their understanding of cultural heritage. VM & SP will support access to culture and citizens' engagement with culture in less developed regions.
Researchers and scholars will benefit from the new possibilities to shape, access and study European Culture.
Synergies between virtual and traditional museums and cultural institutions will support the economic growth of the sector as measurable impacts will be achieved beyond the beneficiaries of the funded projects.

Collections in archives, museums, and at cultural heritage sites contain a wealth of digital texts, images, audio-visual content and 3D representations of objects or scenes as well as other information such as multispectral or thermal imaging revealing the actual state of conservation, which are largely inaccessible to both computers and humans. In addition, human beings as members of their societies can be regarded as natural archives entail information about the complex semantic and conceptual knowledge organizing a society in its cultural settings and stored in non-verbal practices and rites as well as in language.
Humans can easily extract meaning from individual digital assets but are quickly overwhelmed by the sheer number of items which are usually spatially and/or temporally disconnected and of different digital quality. New technologies can be a valuable instrument to process large amounts of data in order to identify new correlations and interpretations and extract new meaning from our cultural and intellectual heritage. To close, or at least narrow, the ""semantic gap"" would present a major step forward in digital humanities and other sciences related to European heritage, memory, identity and cultural interaction. Likewise, it is of immediate relevance to find new ways of accessing the complex information embodied in culture-related human ‘natural archives'. In addition, the increase and growing complexity of digital cultural material raises new challenges as regards its preservation over time, an essential condition for re-use and study.
Scope:
In order to better understand and inform the present by richer interpretations of the past, actions should create affordable and efficient digital access, documentary methods analysis and preservation services for cultural resources. This should be achieved by tackling issues such as automatic contextualisation and identification of content and by developing analytical tools, including methods for automatically finding content which is semantically similar to a given item, or content which is related to a given high-level concept. This aspect also calls for fundamental work related to the philosophy of meta-data designs especially of language-based data that should be in close coherence with the architecture and typology of human conceptual systems. Actions should also develop innovative tools and methods to extract meaning from digital artefacts (including video recordings, audio recordings, digital images, text, multispectral and thermal information and 3D representations of objects or scenes) considering also the spatio-temporal dimension and the quality of the digital content in order to allow the study and preservation of European heritage. The work must fundamentally address the issue of data quality and interoperability.
Work will be performed in close collaboration with Humanities and Social Sciences researchers.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 2 and 3 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. This does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.

Specific challenge:
 Europe's cultural heritage is being lost at an alarming rate, not only due to natural decay and human impacts but frequently also as a result of environmental changes, climatic conditions or natural hazards. This non-renewable resource, in all its diverse physical forms needs safeguarding for future generations.  Cultural heritage, an important component of individual and collective identity, also fuels Tourism in Europe, a significant economic sector on which many communities depend.  However, the increased frequency and intensity of extreme weather events together with risks associated to natural hazards present an added challenge for the sustainable management and conservation of cultural heritage in Europe, calling for improved adaptation and mitigation strategies in this vulnerable sector.
Scope:
The proposal should aim to develop eco-innovative solutions to help mitigate the effects of climate change and natural hazards on cultural heritage sites, structures and artefacts taking into account the values they hold for people and respecting their historic and cultural integrity.   Effective adaptation strategies, systems and technologies are needed for better risk management of vulnerable heritage materials and for mitigating damage to cultural heritage assets.  Proposals  may include case studies and address any research gaps or barriers needed to respond to this challenge, including aspects relating to innovative environmental assessment methodologies, integrated monitoring technologies and systems, improved non-invasive and non-destructive methods of surveying and diagnosis including wide area surveillance, cost-effective conservation and restoration techniques, risk management, disaster prevention and quick damage assessment when catastrophes occur.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU between the range of 6 to 8 million euro would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected impact:
More sustainable and effective safeguarding and management of European cultural heritage through more reliable predictive and cost effective maintenance, improved risk management, diagnosis and treatment and a better understanding of the historical and technological contexts of heritage materials and objects. More effective advice and input to restoration and adaptation policies of government organisations thereby promoting improved practices for the guardians of cultural heritage assets. Reduced fragmentation in this sector through increased collaboration and cooperation and a fostering of an interdisciplinary approach.
The action is expected to proactively target the needs and requirements of users,such as decision makers at local, regional, national and international level responsible for disaster mitigation and safeguarding of cultural heritage assets.

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Public administrations are important actors in the European society to deliver public goods and values, from protecting vulnerable people to finding out information on waste collection. They have a complex and varied function, providing essential support, defining rules in a complex society. Due to different historical backgrounds, they are also organised very differently and play different roles across Europe. Today, the continuous improvement of public administrations, public services and policies is at the heart of the agenda of policy-makers. While new organisational structures, concepts and digital tools have contributed to increasing the efficiency, effectiveness, inclusiveness and quality of public administrations, today's societal challenges are ever more complex and inter-linked. Simultaneously, economic and budgetary pressures constrain the public sector, while governments need to renew their legitimacy, addressing the increasing and ever more complex expectations from citizens and businesses. Citizens call for more efficient and accountable use of public funds, meaningful participation in public affairs and for services that are as easy to use and personalised as for example electronic banking. There is a need to find ways that more effectively create public value - related to quality of public service delivery, public sector efficiency, social inclusion and participation, public trust and good governance - in an environment of constant change. Addressing these complex issues requires holistic responses, which in turn call for the transformation of public administrations and its role in society.
Effective collaboration across government departments and with non-governmental actors is essential to good governance. It requires working across portfolio boundaries to jointly achieve integrated responses to the issues of policy development. In addition, effective collaboration with societal actors in public service delivery and policy-making can help governments improve their ability to address user needs and innovate their problem solving capacity. ICT is a key enabler to facilitate this. Effective engagement with societal actors can help unlock societal assets, thereby easing the resource needs on governments, allow new services and new businesses to be born and help citizens to actively participate in the decisions that affect their lives. It allows them to be involved in the co-creation of services, including their design and delivery, as well as in finding solutions to societal challenges[1]. Collaboration, sharing and re-use between public administrations can help reduce administrative burden, waste and duplication and drive efficiency.
This calls for innovative and collaborative mechanisms with new institutional arrangements, leadership and human resources’ capacities and structures for greater collaboration among government agencies and departments and with other actors. It requires reflecting upon the likely changes in people’s expectations about their relationships with governments, their role and their ability to deliver public value - and this calls governments to re-examine their governance approaches and strategies[2]. It requires understanding the legal, political and cultural aspects of this transformation and prepare for the necessary organisational, administrative, technical human resource and legal changes to link departments internally together, but also to effectively engage with users, citizens, businesses, social partners, civil society organisations, non-profit organisations, social enterprises, communities and all those who want to interact. It raises questions about how governments can organise themselves around user expectations, needs and associated requirements, rather than their own internal logic and needs. How can they create an open environment and ecosystem, where public administrations make tools supported by ICT, assets, data, information and resources available for re-use, invite all actors to collaborate within clear frameworks? How can governments still they remain accountable for public value generation? How can co-creation and collaboration transform the way public and collective issues are explored and how services and policies are designed, produced and delivered? Which role can professional communicators, e.g. journalists, play in this process? What is the impact of different country contexts? What sectors of public policy are potentially the most concerned by this transformation? What new rules and standards, organisations, resource allocation, institutional capacities are needed? Measured impacts, recommendations and lessons can inform policy-makers' judgement on whether and how they would be able to embark on the transformation towards the open and collaborative government 'environment'. What are the underlying conditions, enablers, risks and barriers?
Through understanding the future role of government and the public sector in Europe, we can enhance European cohesion, well-being, welfare and unity, while challenging the narratives of voices which question the relevance of European values. In order to contribute to individual and societal development, we need to consider how to embrace the positive potential of digital technologies to strengthen the cohesion of European society, through shared values and to facilitate active participation in the democratic system.
Scope:
a) Research and Innovation Actions
(2016/2017) Research is needed to explore and analyse how the public administrations can become open and collaborative, encouraging the engagement and participation of public, private and civil society stakeholders - such as for example other public authorities, users, citizens, businesses, researchers, civil society organisations, social innovators, social entrepreneurs, media actors, artists and designers - for effective, appropriate and user-friendly public service design, delivery and policy-making.
The research proposals should present evidence of previous experience in creating environments fostering co-creation through engaging different societal actors in addressing research and impact goals (scientific, political and social) and their planned research should go beyond the existing theories and empirical evidence. The actions need to engage multi-disciplinary and multi-sectoral teams to explore the complexity of public services, enablers for public administrations, identify the necessary changes, risks and barriers to implementation, assess the potential of different policy domains and explore feasibility in different public administration contexts (across a representative set of Member States and different levels of governments). The actions need to provide a set of concrete recommendations for policy-makers at local, regional and national level. The actions need to address the transferability and sustainability of their results.
Proposals need to address several of the below aspects:
Exploring what the role of governments in an open and collaborative government setting may be and how this could be embedded in an EU setting (taking into account shared European values, diversity as well as principles of subsidiarity);
Developing methods and approaches to understanding community assets, needs and requirements in order to provide meaningful public services;
Understanding the demographics, appropriateness of participatory practices and their feasibility for scaling up, so as to generate civic participation on all levels, ensure level playing field in public engagement and legitimacy of the process;
Analysing the necessary cultural attitudes, roles, skills, expertise, knowledge as well as incentives and drivers (such as for example possibilities for wellbeing, healthy life, employment, democracy issue, etc.) of those involved in this process (including civil servants, service providers and users);
Exploring how innovative processes and mechanisms (e.g. through scalable open platforms or open architectures, etc.) can be embedded in public administrations to create an open digital government environment and ecosystem for improving service delivery and citizen engagement;
Analysing the conditions under which user-knowledge input is fully integrated in the services/policy development/design process;
Analysing what co-creation in the public sector can learn from the private sector in terms of critical drivers and enabling factors;
Exploring the suitability of different institutional frameworks for collaboration both within the public sector and with external actors that allow sharing data, information and services internally between departments and with external parties for re-use;
Exploring the suitability of innovative technologies that facilitate for example co-creation, sharing relevant information between stakeholders, address issues of privacy, data protection and security or improve communication;
Analysing the drivers and enabling factors for societal actors to engage in public service or policy co-creation and identifying different sustainability models (such as for example Public Private Partnerships, government spin-offs, hybrid government teams, etc.);
Exploring, monitoring and measurement approaches, methods and tools to understand the impact of open, innovative and collaborative government for public administrations, for growth and societal well-being and for substantiating the link between innovative public sector service and public sector efficiency.
Actions may want to strengthen their recommendations for prioritisation of reform steps to be taken by relying on insights through perception data with respect to the public sector in general or the public administration in particular (e.g. bottlenecks perceived by both the citizens and businesses in dealing with the public sector, etc.) It is essential that users are a fundamental part of any proposed project and proposals may want to validate the prototype developed in any of the above.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 4 and 5 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. This does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
b) Coordination and Support Action[3]
(2016) The aim is to bring together actors inside and outside public administrations, including policy makers, politicians, civil society organisations, users, businesses, researchers, social innovators, social entrepreneurs, initiatives, good practices both in the EU and internationally to identify good practice cases, discuss and exchange on the transformation of public administrations in Europe and discuss the future role of government in this context. Proposals will need to develop a strategic stakeholder engagement plan and a roadmap for future research directions.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU in the order of EUR 0.5 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. This does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
The actions will form the basis for new institutional strategies and mechanisms to enhance collaboration among government departments and with other actors to collaboratively design, produce and deliver public services and policies. The findings will help public administrations at all levels to rethink their roles in the European society. Results will give guidance to governments and policy makers on how to transform public administrations to become open, innovative and collaborative. The policy recommendations will provide guidance on the cultural, legal or procedural changes needed to facilitate the direct uptake of research and other insights by stakeholders. The actions will also improve the understanding of the effectiveness of related public policies in different democratic models. Taking up the policy recommendations will ultimately lead to improved public service delivery and policy effectiveness, higher quality services, improved societal evidence, improved user experiences and inclusiveness as well as increasing level of civic participation, transparency, trust, social inclusion, accountability of institutions and good governance.

Citizens call for more efficient and accountable use of public funds, meaningful participation in public affairs and for services that are as easy to use and personalised as for example electronic banking. There is a need to find ways that more effectively create public value - related to quality of public service delivery, public sector efficiency, social inclusion and participation, public trust and good governance - in an environment of constant change. Addressing these complex issues requires holistic responses, which in turn call for the transformation of public administrations and its role in society.
Effective collaboration across government departments and with non-governmental actors is essential to good governance. It requires working across portfolio boundaries to jointly achieve integrated responses to the issues of policy development. In addition, effective collaboration with societal actors in public service delivery and policy-making can help governments improve their ability to address user needs and innovate their problem solving capacity. ICT is a key enabler to facilitate this. Effective engagement with societal actors can help unlock societal assets, thereby easing the resource needs on governments, allow new services and new businesses to be born and help citizens to actively participate in the decisions that affect their lives. It allows them to be involved in the co-creation of services, including their design and delivery, as well as in finding solutions to societal challenges[1]. Collaboration, sharing and re-use between public administrations can help reduce administrative burden, waste and duplication and drive efficiency.
This calls for innovative and collaborative mechanisms with new institutional arrangements, leadership and human resources’ capacities and structures for greater collaboration among government agencies and departments and with other actors. It requires reflecting upon the likely changes in people’s expectations about their relationships with governments, their role and their ability to deliver public value - and this calls governments to re-examine their governance approaches and strategies[2]. It requires understanding the legal, political and cultural aspects of this transformation and prepare for the necessary organisational, administrative, technical human resource and legal changes to link departments internally together, but also to effectively engage with users, citizens, businesses, social partners, civil society organisations, non-profit organisations, social enterprises, communities and all those who want to interact. It raises questions about how governments can organise themselves around user expectations, needs and associated requirements, rather than their own internal logic and needs. How can they create an open environment and ecosystem, where public administrations make tools supported by ICT, assets, data, information and resources available for re-use, invite all actors to collaborate within clear frameworks? How can governments still they remain accountable for public value generation? How can co-creation and collaboration transform the way public and collective issues are explored and how services and policies are designed, produced and delivered? Which role can professional communicators, e.g. journalists, play in this process? What is the impact of different country contexts? What sectors of public policy are potentially the most concerned by this transformation? What new rules and standards, organisations, resource allocation, institutional capacities are needed? Measured impacts, recommendations and lessons can inform policy-makers' judgement on whether and how they would be able to embark on the transformation towards the open and collaborative government 'environment'. What are the underlying conditions, enablers, risks and barriers?
Through understanding the future role of government and the public sector in Europe, we can enhance European cohesion, well-being, welfare and unity, while challenging the narratives of voices which question the relevance of European values. In order to contribute to individual and societal development, we need to consider how to embrace the positive potential of digital technologies to strengthen the cohesion of European society, through shared values and to facilitate active participation in the democratic system.
Scope:
a) Research and Innovation Actions
(2016/2017) Research is needed to explore and analyse how the public administrations can become open and collaborative, encouraging the engagement and participation of public, private and civil society stakeholders - such as for example other public authorities, users, citizens, businesses, researchers, civil society organisations, social innovators, social entrepreneurs, media actors, artists and designers - for effective, appropriate and user-friendly public service design, delivery and policy-making.
The research proposals should present evidence of previous experience in creating environments fostering co-creation through engaging different societal actors in addressing research and impact goals (scientific, political and social) and their planned research should go beyond the existing theories and empirical evidence. The actions need to engage multi-disciplinary and multi-sectoral teams to explore the complexity of public services, enablers for public administrations, identify the necessary changes, risks and barriers to implementation, assess the potential of different policy domains and explore feasibility in different public administration contexts (across a representative set of Member States and different levels of governments). The actions need to provide a set of concrete recommendations for policy-makers at local, regional and national level. The actions need to address the transferability and sustainability of their results.
Proposals need to address several of the below aspects:
Exploring what the role of governments in an open and collaborative government setting may be and how this could be embedded in an EU setting (taking into account shared European values, diversity as well as principles of subsidiarity);
Developing methods and approaches to understanding community assets, needs and requirements in order to provide meaningful public services;
Understanding the demographics, appropriateness of participatory practices and their feasibility for scaling up, so as to generate civic participation on all levels, ensure level playing field in public engagement and legitimacy of the process;
Analysing the necessary cultural attitudes, roles, skills, expertise, knowledge as well as incentives and drivers (such as for example possibilities for wellbeing, healthy life, employment, democracy issue, etc.) of those involved in this process (including civil servants, service providers and users);
Exploring how innovative processes and mechanisms (e.g. through scalable open platforms or open architectures, etc.) can be embedded in public administrations to create an open digital government environment and ecosystem for improving service delivery and citizen engagement;
Analysing the conditions under which user-knowledge input is fully integrated in the services/policy development/design process;
Analysing what co-creation in the public sector can learn from the private sector in terms of critical drivers and enabling factors;
Exploring the suitability of different institutional frameworks for collaboration both within the public sector and with external actors that allow sharing data, information and services internally between departments and with external parties for re-use;
Exploring the suitability of innovative technologies that facilitate for example co-creation, sharing relevant information between stakeholders, address issues of privacy, data protection and security or improve communication;
Analysing the drivers and enabling factors for societal actors to engage in public service or policy co-creation and identifying different sustainability models (such as for example Public Private Partnerships, government spin-offs, hybrid government teams, etc.);
Exploring, monitoring and measurement approaches, methods and tools to understand the impact of open, innovative and collaborative government for public administrations, for growth and societal well-being and for substantiating the link between innovative public sector service and public sector efficiency.
Actions may want to strengthen their recommendations for prioritisation of reform steps to be taken by relying on insights through perception data with respect to the public sector in general or the public administration in particular (e.g. bottlenecks perceived by both the citizens and businesses in dealing with the public sector, etc.) It is essential that users are a fundamental part of any proposed project and proposals may want to validate the prototype developed in any of the above.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 4 and 5 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. This does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
b) Coordination and Support Action[3]
(2016) The aim is to bring together actors inside and outside public administrations, including policy makers, politicians, civil society organisations, users, businesses, researchers, social innovators, social entrepreneurs, initiatives, good practices both in the EU and internationally to identify good practice cases, discuss and exchange on the transformation of public administrations in Europe and discuss the future role of government in this context. Proposals will need to develop a strategic stakeholder engagement plan and a roadmap for future research directions.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU in the order of EUR 0.5 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. This does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
The actions will form the basis for new institutional strategies and mechanisms to enhance collaboration among government departments and with other actors to collaboratively design, produce and deliver public services and policies. The findings will help public administrations at all levels to rethink their roles in the European society. Results will give guidance to governments and policy makers on how to transform public administrations to become open, innovative and collaborative. The policy recommendations will provide guidance on the cultural, legal or procedural changes needed to facilitate the direct uptake of research and other insights by stakeholders. The actions will also improve the understanding of the effectiveness of related public policies in different democratic models. Taking up the policy recommendations will ultimately lead to improved public service delivery and policy effectiveness, higher quality services, improved societal evidence, improved user experiences and inclusiveness as well as increasing level of civic participation, transparency, trust, social inclusion, accountability of institutions and good governance.

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
“Europe” has existed as a cultural, political and economic identity for centuries, although the nature and coherence of that identity has been contested greatly over time. One of the major challenges for Europe since the mid twentieth century has been the challenge of linking European identity to forms of integration that produce mutual benefit through tolerance, respect and creative interaction, and avoid the devastating conflicts of the past. Culture plays an essential role in this process, since the realm of culture is where values, belief-systems, memories, languages, educational systems, artistic practices and social lives operate and evolve. Culture is where forms of creativity and diversity can be modelled or practiced; it is also a place where separateness, difference and specificity can be asserted and maintained in productive ways that enhance our quality of life. The cultural, political and economic spheres exist in dynamic relation to each other, and the coherence of Europe at the political and economic levels is closely related to and impacted by events and practices at the level of culture.
The attempt to create European integration (which is to be distinguished from simple “homogenisation”) at political, economic and cultural levels has been incomplete; this is evident in the phenomena of xenophobia, extremism, ethnic conflict, Euro-scepticism and the revival of the North-South and East-West divides, as well as electoral apathy or disenchantment. At the same time, there is strong awareness among citizens and immigrants of living in a distinct “European” space, both real and imagined. It is made real in geographical focal points like cities, particular regions and landscapes, and in other forms of cultural heritage. Arts and creative industries have also proved to be vehicles of European integration: a growing number of vibrant urban spaces, populated by international communities of creative practitioners, are now acknowledged as engines of cultural and economic development and innovation. The challenge for research is to identify how the relations between culture and integration have been modelled and how they can be better understood for the immediate future.
Specifically, there is an urgent need to understand the role of culture in defining “public space”, and role of culture in enabling or problematizing cultural integration whilst respecting diversity. “Public spaces” are the arenas in which key cultural interactions and societal dynamics take place and can be observed. This notion of “public space” can be interpreted widely: it includes physical and built environments, landscapes and material culture. But it also includes cultural zones, public spheres and “virtual” spaces defined by media, language, ethnicity, shared values, political allegiances, religious identities, creative practices, and communication technologies. These spaces are populated not just by people but by material objects, texts, art works, performances and institutions, all of which contribute to the creation of a sense of place. Recent research is acknowledging the crucial importance of physical things, objects and material traces of culture, and the value of material culture for providing new ways of looking at multiple histories and identities within a diversified Europe.
Scope:
Activities under this topic should explore the dynamics through which European “public spaces” both shape, and are shaped, by cultural activity, and the dynamics through which integration can be practised and understood. This will involve investigating a variety of perspectives: for example, historical models for European public space, and the relevance of such models for today; the impact of migration on culture and the creation of public space; the role of material culture in shaping public spaces; the role of creativity in defining European identity; and the role of the cultural sphere in either enabling or challenging integration at political and economic levels. Activities may also include researching questions such as: How meaningful is it to speak of a common “European” culture or history or public space? How should such a concept be modelled, and how has it been modelled in the past? How has the circulation of knowledge (through media, research, publishing practices, intellectual and education networks) contributed to or challenged European integration? How do various European spaces and identities make use of the media and systems of representation? Are representations of Europe mainly created and captured by Northern/continental Europe and how do Southern and Central and Eastern Europe citizens contribute and participate to a European public space? What are the relations between material objects and cultural and political practices? How can multiple histories and cultures be integrated into a notion of national or “European” identities?
There is a strong need for humanities-oriented research in this topic, as a well as a need for multi-disciplinary engagement representing also a large variety of European countries well balanced geographically, including from Southern and Central and Eastern Europe. There is significant potential also to facilitate new collaborations between researchers and partners in the media, heritage, creative and other sectors, thus adding value to research-led knowledge exchange.
The proposed ERA-NET Cofund will have a wide geographical coverage, including Southern and Central and Eastern Europe. It aims at coordinating the research efforts of the participating Member States, Associated States and Regions in the field described. Proposals should pool the necessary financial resources from the participating national (or regional) research programmes and implement a joint transnational call for proposals with EU co-funding (resulting in grants to third parties) to fund multinational innovative research initiatives in this domain. Proposers are encouraged to implement other joint activities, including additional joint calls without EU co-funding.
Participation of legal entities from international partner countries is encouraged in the joint call as well as in other joint activities. Participants from countries which are not automatically eligible for funding[1] may nonetheless request a Union contribution on to cover the coordination costs of additional activities on the basis of the ERA-NET unit cost.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of a maximum of EUR 5 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately.
Expected Impact:
The ERA-NET Co-fund Action will mobilise the wide range of transnational and multi-disciplinary perspectives necessary to understanding the relationships of culture, European integration and “public space”, including in Southern and Central and Eastern Europe. The research is expected to lead to a richer, more complex and comprehensive understanding of the cultural dimensions of European integration; to discover and analyse historical models and precedents for integration in Europe; to give new insights that promote the full potential of citizens’ engagement with European public and cultural spaces; to stimulate public, political and scholarly debate about the future prospects of European integration; to provide a platform for changes to existing structures, policies and practices, such as the development of new modes of interactive and reciprocal engagement between users, academics and those working in the media, creative industries, and heritage sectors.

","13 September 2017","Specific Challenge:
The fundamental values forming the foundation of the European Union are stated in and ensured by the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union under the headings of dignity, freedoms, equality, solidarity, citizens' rights and justice. Reactions and responses to the increased flows of migrants, including refugees arriving in Europe, combined with the backdrop of the economic crisis, have put these fundamental values and the ideal of a Europe 'united in diversity' under pressure.
Migration to Europe triggers concerns about its socio-economic but also its cultural impact on European societies. Simultaneously, it raises debates about what the European core values are, what challenges them and even whether core values exist or ought to exist. Recent developments have led to escalating tensions between nationalism and Europeanisation. At the same time, civil movements have arisen across Europe, for example to assist migrants, and notably refugees, with entering and integrating into European societies. Values, be they political, philosophical, cultural, educational or religious are by nature fluid and changeable, subject to processes of historical developments, external influences, and continuous negotiation and contestation[1]. Meanwhile, values may be experienced and expressed as fixed, sacred, absolute and non-negotiable and may be instrumentalised.
Scope:
Research should explore normatively as well as empirically how migration, in particular the refugee challenge, and the response to it have impacted core values in Europe. This can include analysing how values are defined, framed, agreed upon and translated into practice in integration policies and initiatives (e.g. in citizenship tests, in cultural orientation courses in contracts and agreements with newly arrived migrants) as well as assessing the concrete effects of these practices on integration outcomes and social cohesion. The framing of values in political and public discourses should also be addressed. Insights from existing public opinion surveys should be included and additional surveys may be conducted as needed. Research should explore what values are considered core and fundamental to people, to what extent these values are shared in Europe and how they are justified politically, culturally, religiously or otherwise. It should also explore the (perceived) role of these values in the integration process.[2] Research should also study the historical and philosophical development, the legal foundations, the artistic representations, and the contemporary contestations and re-conceptualisations of these core values and ideals. Furthermore, research should focus on the impact of cultural and human encounters on core values and traditions as well as on the ongoing re-interpretations of these. A particular attention should be dedicated to cultural memory that may become at the same time more intangible and more essential for people whose historical heritage has been deliberately destroyed. The gender dimension should be an integral part of this part of the research.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU in the order of EUR 2.5 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. This does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
The research is expected to improve the knowledge base on the impact of migration, and in particular the refugee challenge, on core values in Europe. It will provide knowledge on what are considered core values across Europe, what core values are shared and to what extent, which core values are contested, and how core values are transmitted in a modern society. The research will provide evidence on the long-term implications of the impact of the refugee challenge on core values in Europe and how these may evolve in the future, also taking into account the cosmopolitisation of European societies.

Specific challenge:
A better understanding of critical infrastructure architecture is necessary for defining measures to achieve a better resilience against threats in an integrated manner including natural and human threats/events (e.g. due to human errors or terrorist/criminal attacks).
Scope:
A holistic approach to the resilience of critical infrastructure should be followed, addressing a broad variety of issues including: human factors (i.e. safety issues radicalization), security, geo-politics, sociology, economy, etc. and increased vulnerability due to changing threats.
Critical Infrastructure resilience is the ability to reduce the impact of disruptive events and the recovery time. The analysis of resilience should therefore not only focus on potential threats caused by attacks or accidents (human error or terrorist/criminal attacks), but also on the expected developments in these areas and the impacts and potential challenges of new technologies. Proposals should also address the need for a paradigm shift in the area of design for safety and resilience.
The proposal shall demonstrate that a set of common and thoroughly validated indicators, including economic indicators, could be applied to critical infrastructures in order to assess its level of “resilience”, moreover a scale approach of “resilience” level should be proposed across critical infrastructures (energy grids, transportation, government, nuclear research infrastructures, water, etc.). The developed methodology shall be based on at least four types of critical infrastructure as test cases. Specific models and modeling approaches will be proposed and developed that facilitates the understanding and modeling of security risks and the related impact. Moreover, security metrics and indicators will be proposed that could be used in the developed models to quantify to the possible extent the considered risk and impact as well as give guidance to the possible mitigation techniques – approaches.
New methods and solutions of assessing resilience based upon comprehensive threat, criticality, and vulnerability assessments are of outmost importance. Proposals should follow a uniformed, comprehensive, and holistic approach at all levels (e.g. EU, country, local) including private organizations charged with protecting citizens, facilities, and infrastructure in order to anticipate current and emerging threats and security challenges.
Integrated concepts of resilience in interconnected infrastructures and cascading effects that have a devastating impact on the functioning of society should also be included.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between €3m and €5m would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately (similar to the FP7 Capability Projects described in the general introduction). Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected impact:
Better risk assessment of different areas of critical infrastructures (energy grid, water supply, transport, communication, etc.) by taking into account interdependencies. More effective and comprehensive methodology using uniform and consistent data from known Critical Infrastructure Protection threats in an integrated manner to develop a resilience level based on summations of various “indicators” (technical and non-technical, i.e. human factors).
The action is expected to proactively target the needs and requirements of public bodies.
The outcome of the proposal is expected to lead to development up to Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 4; please see part G of the General Annexes.

Specific challenge:
Climate change in Third Countries is a real threat to security of the European Union. Extreme weather or other climate events which devastate lives, infrastructure, but also institutions and budgets can have disastrous consequences on European security, as climate-driven crises occurring outside the EU can have detrimental effects and direct or indirect security implications on the Union (e.g. climate-driven migration forcing large number of people to move from their homelands to another country – EU Member State; supply chain security; food security; reliance on imports of raw material etc.), including EU assets in third countries.
Therefore, adequate political, strategic and institutional responses should be found in order to enhance international and European cooperation on the detection assessment and monitoring of the security threats in Europe related to climate change in other regions of the world. European policy makers and analysts as well as national governments should tackle climate change as today's non-traditional security hazard.
The research aims at facilitating the adoption of a comprehensive approach, with a view to help minimising negative consequences of climate-driven crises.
Scope:
Proposals in this field may focus on the following issues:
Taking into account past and on-going EU research, this topic should thoroughly examine the specific causes and the impact of climate-driven crises on European security.
What kind of instruments, tools, and actions can be used alongside mitigation and adaptation policies to address the climate change security risks?
Which could be the most efficient ways of developing contingency plans for the EU's response to the effects of climate-driven crises occurring outside the Union that have direct or indirect security implications on the Union?
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between €1m and €2m would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected impact:
This action will help stakeholders to better understand consequences of climate change events in Third Countries and its security implications for the EU.
It will provide a framework for improving situation analysis and policy planning at the EU level.
It will thus lead to earlier and better reaction of climate induced security implications by public authorities in the EU.
The action is expected to proactively target the needs and requirements of users, such as European policy makers and analysts as well as national governments.

Specific challenge:
Many online users are reluctant to disclose personal information online because of privacy concerns. Personal data has become an economic asset, but it is not the owners, i.e. the users, that control or monetize it. This is in the hands of the service providers whose business case often includes the use of data they collect (e.g. social networks, search engines, online retailers, and cloud hosting services).
Data protection and privacy frameworks in Member States and Associated Countries need to be implemented in a transparent and user-friendly way to help users understand how their personal data might be used, including the economic value of their data. Such knowledge will enable them to exercise choice and know and assert their rights. As the economic value of their data is not known to the average user, they are not able to evaluate the value of their data relative to the value they assign to a ""free"" service. Moreover, the users have no control over what happens with their data, e.g. they cannot verify the data is not passed on to 3rd parties. This situation may influence individuals notion of privacy which may be perceived as a non-valuable asset.
Data protection principles need to be visibly respected for the delivery of personalised public services, to increase trust in public administrations. Transparency is particularly important in an open government context, where personal data may be shared between different departments and administrations or across borders and where third parties can engage in the creation and delivery of personalised services for citizens and businesses.
Scope:
The focus is on the demonstration of solutions to protect individuals' privacy by default while empowering the users to set the desired level of privacy, based on a simple to understand visualisation of the privacy level, giving them control over how their data will be used by service providers (including public authorities), and making it easier for them to verify both whether their online rights are respected and if they get a reasonable bargain. The activities may also cover tools facilitating the information of individuals about the processing of their personal data. Systems will either have to detect the privacy settings automatically, or the data will have its privacy settings permanently associated to it by the user.
Activities can include the investigation of measures to safeguard privacy in the context of mass data handling, for example where services exploiting big data, cloud services, data sharing by interconnected devices in the internet of things, and data handling in the highly sensitive context of criminal investigations.
Where relevant, actions can be proposed to apply privacy-by-design frameworks for a range of different applications to promote the usage of privacy enhanced technology.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between €2m and €5m EURO  would allow this topic to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Proposals have to address the specific needs of the end-user, private and public security end user alike. Proposals are encouraged to include public security end-users and/or private end users.
Expected impact:
The actions supported under this objective are to provide a practical, user friendly and economically viable implementation of the legal obliations related to personal data processing and the legal obligation for prior consent. The actions will not only identify but more importantly implement privacy by design architectures. It is expected that the actions will lead to an increased user trust online, resulting in a higher uptake of online services. Actions should generate positive business cases for online privacy.

Insecure ICT is also imposing a significant cost on users (individuals and organisations) who have to mitigate the resulting risk by implementing additional technical and procedural measures which are resource consuming.
Smart systems, highly connected cyber-physical systems (CPS) are introducing a high dynamism in the system to develop and validate. Hence, CPS are evolving in a complex and dynamic environment, making safety-critical decisions based on information from other systems not known during development.
Another key challenge is posed by domains, such as medical devices, critical infrastructure facilities, and cloud data centres, where security is deeply intertwined and a prerequisite for other trustworthiness aspects such as safety and privacy.
The challenges are further intensified by the increasing trend of using third party components for critical infrastructures, by the ubiquity of embedded systems and the growing uptake of IoT as well as the deployment of decentralized and virtualized architectures.
In order to tackle these challenges, there is a need of appropriate assurances that our ICT systems are secure and trustworthy by design as well as a need of certified levels of assurance where security is regarded as the primary concern. Likewise, target architectures and methods improving the efficiency of assurance cases are needed in order to lower their costs.
Scope:
a. Research and Innovation Actions - Assurance
Providing assurance is a complex task, requiring the development of a chain of evidence and specific techniques during all the phases of the ICT Systems Development Lifecycle (SDLC for short: e.g. design verification, testing, and runtime verification and enforcement) including the validation of individual devices and components. These techniques are complementary yet all necessary, each of them independently contributing towards improving security assurance. It includes methods for reliability and quality development and validation of highly dynamic systems.
Proposals may address security, reliability and safety assurance at individual phases of the SDLC and are expected to cover at least one of the areas identified below, depending on their relevance to the proposal overall objectives:
Security requirements specification and formalization;
Security properties formal verification and proofs at design and runtime
Secure software coding;
Assurance-aware modular or distributed architecting and algorithmic;
Software code review, static and dynamic security testing;
Automated tools for system validation and testing;
Attack and threat modelling;
Vulnerability analysis;
Vendor (third-party) application security testing;
Penetration testing;
Collection and management of evidence for assessing security and trustworthiness;
Operational assurance, verification and security policy enforcement;
Adaptive security by design and during operation.
Proposal should strive to quantify their progress beyond the state of the art in terms of efficiency and effectiveness. Particular importance within this context should be placed on determining the appropriate metrics.
Proposals should take into account the changing threat landscape, where targeted attacks and advanced persistent threats assume an increasingly more important role and address the challenge of security assurance in state-of-the-art development methods and deployment models including but not limited to solutions focussing on reducing the cost and complexity of assurance in large-scale systems.
Proposals should include a clear standardisation plan at submission time.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU between EUR 3 and 4 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
The outcome of the proposals are expected to lead to development up to Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 3 to 5; please see part G of the General Annexes.
b. Innovation Actions – Security Certification
Proposals should address the challenge of improving the effectiveness and efficiency of existing security certification processes for state-of-the-art ICT components and products including the production and delivery of the corresponding guidance materials.
In terms of effectiveness, proposals should address, amongst other factors, emerging threats, compositional certification and reuse of components in the context of certified systems and certification throughout the operational deployment of a product or a service.
In terms of efficiency, proposals should strive to reduce the cost and duration of the certification process.
Proposals may address security certification in any area of their choice. Consortia submitting proposals are expected to approach the selected topic as widely as possible including all necessary actors – e.g. industry, academia, certification laboratories - and involve the relevant certification authorities from at least three Member States in order to achieve added value at a European level.
Proposals are encouraged to work towards moderate to high assurance level protection profiles as a way to validate their results.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU between EUR 3 and 4 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
The outcome of the proposals are expected to lead to development up to Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 6 to 7; please see part G of the General Annexes.
c. Coordination and Support Actions
To complement the research and innovation activities in security assurance and certification in this topic, support and coordination actions should address the following:
Building trustworthiness: economic, legal and social aspects of security assurance and certification
Study in depth the economic and legal aspects related to assurance and certification (including European-wide labelling), EU and International regulatory aspects;
Explore and identify the interplay of relevant social, cultural, behavioural, gender and ethical factors with ICT systems with regards to their trustworthiness and security, actual or perceived
Identify barriers and incentives in the market for certified products in the consumer and/or enterprise market;
Produce a comprehensive cost/benefit model for security assurance and certification;
Engage with multidisciplinary communities and stakeholders.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of up to EUR 1 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
European ICT offering a higher level of assurance compared to non-European ICT products and services.
ICT products and services more compliant with relevant European security and/or privacy regulations.
ICT with a higher level of security assurance at marginally additional cost.
Facilitation of mutual recognition of security certificates across the EU.
Increased market uptake of secure ICT products.
Increased user trust in ICT products and services.
Reduction of negative externalities associated with deployment of insecure ICT.
More resilient critical infrastructures and services.
Progress beyond the state-of-the-art in the effectiveness and efficiency of the areas addressed by the proposals.

Many cyber security failures in systems and organisations can only be explained and appropriately addressed by examining the problem through not only from the technical point of view but also through a deep societal, institutional and economic analysis.
Moreover, current structures at institutional level (national and international) as well as incentive frameworks (financial or regulatory, positive or negative) don't seem to be able to provide adequate coverage to threats.
Scope:
With a multidisciplinary approach combining economic, behavioural, societal and engineering insights, measurement approaches and methodologies and combining methods from microeconomics, econometrics, qualitative social sciences, behavioural sciences, decision making, risk management and experimental economics, proposals are expected to cover one of the following two strands:
Cybersecurity cost-benefit framework:
Security and privacy cost models including the pricing of digital assets, modelling and methods for estimation of costs of intangible risks (reputation, non-critical service disruption…) and relevant metrics and indicators;
The proposals should study and take into consideration relevant market sector specificities, and validate their models with relevant actors from these sectors.
Optimal investment in information security, risk management and cyber security insurance;
Incentives and business models:
Identifying the incentives and striking the right balance between cooperative and regulatory approaches to information sharing regarding incidents and vulnerabilities;
Consider behavioural aspects of security and privacy;
Investigate the opportunities and risks of information security markets (e.g. bug bounties, vulnerability discovery & disclosure);
Develop revenue models for criminal activity and the deployment of cost-effective security measures as necessary disincentive for attacks and cyber-criminal activity.
For both strands proposals should also investigate improvements and/or alternatives to current institutional and governance frameworks (market-driven as well as national and international regulatory) with a view to improving cybersecurity.
Based on their results, proposals should provide a set recommendations addressed to all relevant stakeholders including policy makers, regulators, law enforcement agencies (where applicable) as well as relevant market operators and insurance companies.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU between EUR 1 and 2 million would allow these areas to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts
Expected Impact:
Improved societal understanding of information security failures and how they should be addressed.

Europe's SMEs, local public administration and citizens face particular challenges in addressing basic cyber security threats.
On one hand, in the case of SMEs and local public administration, their size and budgetary constraints often precludes them from putting in place highly granular organisational structures, retaining dedicated information security personnel and making significant investments in cybersecurity products or services.
Individuals, constantly portrayed as the ""weakest link"" face the daunting task of having to constantly adapt their behaviour at home and in the workplace and the way they use both their personal or work-related IT equipment and devices in order to avoid falling prey to the latest threats and techniques that malicious actors leverage against them.
Moreover, whether addressing SMEs, local public administrations or individuals, few cyber security solutions have been designed with the human factor in mind and therefore present severe limitations in their usability which hampers proper decision making and adequate usage.
Scope:
Taking into consideration the adequate level of security commensurate with the considered use-case, proposals may address one of the following types of end-users:
SMEs,
local public administration,
individual citizens.
To identify the most wide spread threats and cyber security issues facing end-users, proposals should take into account the guidance documents, best practices and standards issued by International Standardisation Organisations, technical forum and Member State Authorities which are tailored for SMEs or Individuals and actively contribute to their development or improvement.
Proposals should develop innovative solutions with a high degree of usability and automation while ensuring that the end-users retain an adequate degree of cyber situational awareness and control.
Factors going beyond technological solutions and focusing on psychological and behavioural factors (including gender) that affect cyber security at individual or organizational levels should be addressed.
Proposals are expected to validate their work through extensive end-user feedback and participation in the consortium where appropriate.
Proposals have to address the specific needs of the end-user, private and public security end users alike. Proposals are encouraged to include public security end-users and/or private end users.
The outcome of the proposals are expected to lead to development up to Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 6 to 7; please see part G of the General Annexes.

Full implication of different private and public actors, as well as empowered citizens, is needed in order to unlock eHealth potential in Europe. To achieve the trust of users, measures of safety have to be taken into consideration in accordance with the ""privacy by design"" approach. This requires secure storage of information including personal data but also guaranteeing safe exchange of these data over a number of architectures of differing security levels preventing unauthorised access, loss of data and cyber-attacks. A systemic approach to security will increase patients' empowerment, help protect their health also while abroad, and possibly encourage a larger number of Member States to apply it and adapt national legislations.
Scope:
Proposals would provide a holistic approach to address challenges of secure storage and exchange (including cross-border) of data, protection and control over personal data, and security of health related data gathered by mobile devices combined with the usability of the eHealth solutions. Proposals should build on existing solutions or developments (openNCP, projects DECIPHER, EPSOS, STORK and others) where possible. Development and use of techniques of homomorphic encryption could be considered. Proposals would also analyse the legal applicable frameworks and societal aspects in the context of deployment of the solution. Existing European and national law including data protection rules, right to be forgotten, giving consent as well as recognized standards have to be respected. The operational solution should be piloted in three different Member States or associated countries. Technologically, it should be easily adaptable in other countries wishing to use it.

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Shared, connected and cooperative automated vehicles may become a game changer for urban mobility. They can provide seamless door to door mobility of people and freight delivery services, which can lead to healthier, more accessible, greener and more sustainable cities, as long as they are integrated in an effective public transport system. Since a few years the development of shared automated vehicle pilots are emerging around the world. Today, most of these pilots are small-scale and involve either on-demand ride services or low-speed shuttles operating in controlled environments. In order to accelerate the uptake of high quality and user oriented mobility services, based on shared, connected and cooperative automated vehicles, there is a need for demonstrating these services in real life conditions to test the performance, safety and viability of these systems and services and to prove that they are attractive for and accepted by users. Furthermore, the potential impacts on reducing CO2 emissions and pollutants, safety and overall transport system costs need to be assessed.
Scope:
The proposed actions should include all the following aspects:
Thorough analysis of new, emerging business/operating models and related technologies for shared, connected and cooperative automated vehicle fleets that are complementing existing high-capacity public transportation systems.
Design innovative shared, connected, cooperative and automated vehicle concepts (road vehicles at SAE level 4 and higher) and the associated new business/operating models addressing user and customer needs, including cultural aspects, for mobility of people and/or delivery of goods. Specific user needs in different regional and operating environments and for different user groups, e.g. elderly, children and users with disabilities should be considered and attractiveness and acceptability by all users should be ensured. The potential of combining automated urban delivery and people transportation should be addressed.
Test robustness, reliability and safety of shared highly automated vehicle fleets that are operating in semi-open or open environments focusing on the interaction with other road users, including pedestrians, cyclists and public transport systems. The fleets should consist of electrified vehicles. Synergies with advanced energy efficient, smart and multimodal mobility concepts should be actively developed. Fleet management should include operational optimisation as well as energy management. Fleet tests should consider the entire ""functional urban area"" and explicitly include feeder services and other collective transport options in peri-urban and low-density urban areas.
Vehicles should use connectivity technologies to allow communication and cooperation between vehicles, infrastructure and with other road users and to enable automated, smart mobility services, innovative fleet management concepts and higher performance of automated vehicle functions. Proposals should make the best use of EGNOS and Galileo which significantly improve the vehicle positioning availability and reliability. The development of solutions for the next generation of cooperative services[1] by efficiently combining C-ITS and automation for smart, smooth, safe and efficient traffic flows (including the development and testing of ""open message definitions"" for all C-ITS stakeholders) would be an asset.
Identify and provide for the needs of vulnerable road users (including their potential re-definition to include non-connected users, out-of-position passengers in automated cars, cyclists, pedestrians, etc.) resulting from this new automated/mixed environment (use of standard & highly automated vehicles).
Develop architecture, functional and technical requirements for ICT technologies, for secure data collection and processing needed for the operation of connected and cooperative automated vehicles. Develop ways to enhance the optimised use of big data in (road) transport for implementing smart and safe mobility solutions, innovative traveller services and (city) traffic management.
Fulfil all security requirements to protect the shared automated vehicles to any threats and avoid any conscious manipulations of the information enabling automated driving.
Assess and demonstrate benefits of the pilot implementation on energy efficiency, traffic flow, safety, user appreciation etc, based on holistic modelling solutions.
In line with the Union's strategy for international cooperation in research and innovation, international cooperation is encouraged. In particular, proposals should consider cooperation with projects or partners from the US, Japan, South Korea, Singapore, and/or Australia. Proposals should foresee twinning with entities participating in projects funded by US DOT to exchange knowledge and experience and exploit synergies. Twinning with Japan is also encouraged.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU between EUR 15 and 30 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
Proposals will test the overall mobility impact, in particular, how shared mobility solutions using connected and cooperative automated vehicles can contribute to a more sustainable, inclusive, and safe mobility system and help residents of a city/region (in particular less mobile persons, elderly and children) to increase mobility and improve urban freight transport efficiency. Proposed actions will help to reduce the total number of passenger cars and goods km in cities, overall CO2 and air pollutant emissions and energy consumption. They will improve market opportunities for SME's and new-entrants by addressing and developing innovative cross-sector business models. Actions will create strategic partnering opportunities between public agencies and the private sector for developing sustainable and scalable business models. They will also support the accelerated deployment of electrified vehicles for shared automated mobility services and integrated strategies for a smart and multi-modal mobility system and urban development, including land use and ITS and infrastructure development.

","31 October 2017
","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Besides technological progress in developing new automated driving functions, there are still many challenges and uncertainties related to the deployment of connected and automated vehicles. Many of these challenges can be better addressed when European partners work together and cooperate with international partners. Therefore, a coordinated and harmonised approach to support the deployment of automated driving systems at European and international level is needed. More cooperation is also necessary to assess the impacts of connected and automated driving systems. Several methodologies to assess impacts of connected and automated transport systems have already been developed and applied. However, a commonly agreed methodology to assess the impacts of connected and automated driving systems that would allow for informed decision making does not exist.
Scope:
This topic will be implemented through two sub-topics (two types of actions). Proposals should address only one of the two.
Subtopic 1) Research and innovation action: Assessment of impacts, benefits and costs of connected, cooperative and automated driving systems
Proposals should address all the following aspects:
Assess the short, medium and long term impacts, benefits and costs of different scenarios/use cases for connected, cooperative and automated driving systems (for passengers cars, automated urban transport and goods transport) considering the full range of impacts including, but not limited to, driver behaviour, mobility behaviour, recharging and refuelling behaviour, accessibility, safety, traffic efficiency, emissions, energy consumption, use of resources, impact on employment, required skills, infrastructure wear and land use.
Establish a solid multidisciplinary methodology to assess the long-term impacts of connected and automated driving systems.
Provide a public toolkit for assessing impacts, benefits and costs of connected and automated systems (including required infrastructures) and decision support system to help authorities to evaluate strategic decisions on urban regulations and planning.
Specific attention should be paid to the transition phase towards higher levels of automation when individual vehicles may operate at different automation levels given the circumstances, and where human and machine operated vehicles are both present in varying penetration degrees.
In line with the Union's strategy for international cooperation in research and innovation, international cooperation is encouraged. In particular, proposals should consider cooperation with projects or partners from the US, Japan, South Korea, Singapore, and/or Australia. Proposals should foresee twinning with entities participating in projects funded by US DOT to exchange knowledge and experience and exploit synergies
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU between EUR 4 and 6 million would allow this sub-topic to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Subtopic 2) Coordination and support action: Networking activities to support connected, cooperative and automated driving
Proposals should address all the following aspects:
Explore ways to strengthen cooperation and experience exchange amongst European and international stakeholders of connected, cooperative and automated driving in areas such as: research and innovation (e.g. human-machine interface, social acceptance of automated driving technologies, digital technologies for automation, impact assessment), global framework and international standards for connectivity and automation technologies, sharing of knowledge and data of large-scale European and national demonstration projects, foster a common evaluation framework across the demonstrations, education and training needs.
Support programme owners and managers to better coordinate national and multi-national funding programmes in the area of connected, cooperative and automated driving, building on past coordination efforts.
Support ongoing and extend international cooperation activities in the area of cooperative, connected and automated driving (including road automation, standardisation harmonisation and connectivity issues). An extension of the cooperation to countries and regions beyond US and Japan should be explored.
Provide a forum for European and international stakeholders of road automation to exchange experiences and knowledge on the development and deployment of cooperative, connected and automated mobility systems and to discuss future challenges. Organise conferences and workshops on connected, cooperative and automated driving in Europe. Interactions fostering discussions on best practices and lessons learned of automated transport solutions across all transport modes are encouraged.
In line with the Union's strategy for international cooperation in research and innovation, international cooperation is encouraged. In particular, proposals should consider cooperation with projects or partners from the US, Japan, South Korea, Singapore, and/or Australia. Proposals should foresee twinning with entities participating in projects funded by US DOT[1] to exchange knowledge and experience and exploit synergies.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU between EUR 2 and 3 million would allow sub-topic topic to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
Enable decision makers to promote the most promising scenarios of connected, cooperative and automated driving systems based on a comprehensive impact assessment and knowledge base.
Demonstrate the expected socio-economic and environmental benefits of future connected, cooperative and automated driving systems and raise awareness and acceptance.
Minimise uncertainties related to the development and acceptability of different scenarios of connected, cooperative and automated driving.
Understand which factors and measures can better unlock and foster the adoption of connected, cooperative and automated vehicles.
Better visibility, comparability and transferability of research and demonstration activities in Europe and worldwide.
Closer cooperation between stakeholders within Europe and worldwide on common challenges in the area of connected and automated driving. Better coordination of national and multi-national funding programmes will create synergies and reduce overlaps when setting R&I priorities.
Support to EU Member States and stakeholders that are undertaking, or planning, larger scale public road tests with connected, cooperative and automated vehicles to exchange learnings and data, exploit synergies and propose common ways on how to leverage pilots towards deployment.
Higher penetration of automated driving functions in the market, resulting in both increased safety on the roads and lower emissions, and stronger market position of European industry in systems for vehicle automation, including through Galileo and EGNOS.

","Research and Innovation action
","04 December 2018
","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Significant research efforts are addressing driver performance and behaviour in automated driving conditions still requiring the driver to be prepared to assume control (SAE automation level 3 and lower). In highly automated driving conditions (SAE automation level 4) the role of the driver will change dramatically since driver intervention is not required during defined use cases. This means that during a single trip there will be a coexistence of different automated driving functions demanding various degrees of human attention. When a vehicle is in highly automated driving mode the driver may take on different behaviours. Solutions need to be developed and they have to ensure both a safe transfer between use cases with different automation levels and that drivers always have a very clear understanding about the degree of automation enabled in each situation.
Scope:
Proposals for research and innovation should focus on the design of safe human-machine interfaces for vehicles with highly automated driving functions and the safe and controlled transfer between use cases of different SAE automation levels (between level 4 to/from levels 3 or 2) for all types of drivers.
The proposed actions should include all of the following aspects:
Research to characterise driver roles in use cases of SAE automation level 4 and for the transition between these and lower automation levels. Upgrade of comprehensive models for driver behaviour/reaction, awareness, readiness and monitoring. Driver generational effects, considering in particular variations in IT usage experience and age, but also other cultural factors should be taken into account.
Effectiveness assessment methods, especially for safety aspects, based on these models. The new relationship between driver and vehicle (mutual cooperation or even handover rather than continuous control) should be reflected, also considering the variety of activities a driver may engage in while the vehicle is in charge. Use cases where an operator controls the vehicle remotely may be included.
Develop easily understood solutions making it clear to the driver what is the operational capability (authority) of the automated mode or modes currently enabled, as well as ensuring safe and reliable function (re-)allocation and corresponding driver/operator readiness. Driver control handover, driver/operator state and impairment are among the aspects that should be considered and the intended driver reaction should be secured.
Demonstration of concept functionality in real world situations with various use cases and driving environments where automated systems receive and give back control from/to the driver.
Proposed actions should build on the knowledge and results of ongoing projects addressing human machine interactions of automated driving systems.
In line with the Union's strategy for international cooperation in research and innovation, international cooperation is encouraged. In particular, proposals should consider cooperation with projects or partners from the US, Japan, South Korea, Singapore, and/or Australia. Proposals should foresee twinning with entities participating in projects funded by US DOT to exchange knowledge and experience and exploit synergies. Twinning with Japan is also encouraged.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU between EUR 4 to 8 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
Innovative solutions, concepts and algorithms for a safe human-machine interface of highly automated driving functions and for safe and controlled transfer between use cases of different automation levels.
Reduction of risks for driver behaviour related incidents by ensuring that drivers/operators are adequately alerted, made aware and engaged when the highly automated vehicle encounters situations or use cases that it cannot handle and thus will turn to lower automation levels.
The research will help achieve the European Transport White Paper ""Vision Zero"" objective by preventing road accidents caused by human errors. Once on the market the developed concepts and solutions will also contribute to Sustainable Development Goal 3 (Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages; in particular goal 3.6. ""By 2020, halve the number of global deaths and injuries from road traffic accidents"").

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
The integration of migrants, including refugees, in many Member States of the European Union and Associated Countries remains a challenge for both public authorities and local communities. ICT-enabled solutions and toolkits for the implementation of inclusion policies by public administrations may facilitate the management of the integration of migrants, improve autonomy and inclusion and therefore the lives of migrants. Such tools may help alleviate the tasks of public administrations and local authorities. They may also analyse available data and provide migrants with information on and easy access to relevant public services specific to their needs or support policy-makers and public administration at all levels in planning and taking decisions on migration-related issues through data analytics and simulation tools. The specific cultural features, including possible gender differences, the skills and capacities of migrants to express their needs as well as the equity of access to ICT may be considered in this regard.
Scope:
An efficient management of migrant integration requires clear understanding of migrants' personal and family situation, including their legal status, origin, cultural background, skills, language skills, medical records, etc. Once such information is available to public authorities, it can improve societal outcomes to the benefit of both host countries and migrants:
1. the management of migrant integration can be facilitated, e.g. by matching their skills with those needed in the Member States and Associated Countries, by designing tailored training programmes or by creating specific decision support tools;
2. better and customised services can be delivered to match the needs of migrants;
3. more efficient integration strategies can be defined and implemented at local level for a sustainable inclusion of migrants and a fact-based public perception of migration.
Proposals should address at least one of the 3 points above, which should be piloted against a set of clearly defined goals. Processing of personal data of migrants must be conducted in accordance with EU applicable data protection legislation (Directive 95/46/EC which will be replaced as of 25 May 2018 by the GDPR) and existing regulation such as eIDAS[1]. Proposals should engage all actors and consider the potential for co-creation work with migrant in the design and delivery of services. In addition, proposals should demonstrate the reusability or scalability at European level and should develop strong and realistic business plans to ensure the long-term sustainability as well as take up of the results by the identified users. They should also engage multi-disciplinary and multi-sectoral teams to explore the complexity of this challenge, to identify the necessary changes, and the risks and barriers to their implementation, including cultural questions.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 3 and 4 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
New or enhanced ICT solutions and tools will facilitate the efforts of public administrations at EU, national and local levels to manage the integration of migrants. They will allow for developing and deploying the necessary processes and services in the view of the efficient identification and inclusion of migrants. They will also facilitate communication with migrants and their access to services such as community language teaching, education, training, employment, welfare and healthcare systems within the host communities.

","09 July 2019
","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
The challenge is to accelerate the design, development and uptake of advanced digital technologies by European industry – especially SMEs and mid-caps –, notably in sectors where digital technologies are underexploited. SMEs and mid-caps in the manufacturing sector need support in the use of secure digital technologies in their production processes, products and business models to enable personalised products and to facilitate cost-effective small-scale production.
Scope:
a) Innovation Actions (IA)
As Phase 4 of I4MS[1], this topic calls for Digital Innovation Hubs that strengthen European SMEs and mid-caps by experimenting and testing in one or more of the following areas. Proposers are requested to identify which of these is the centre of gravity of their proposed project. Proposals should cover the manufacturing sector at large, including discrete manufacturing, continuous production, and construction. If appropriate, building ecosystems around digital industrial platforms driven by European actors should be supported.
Smart modelling, simulation, and optimisation for digital twins
Experimentation of novel modelling, simulation, and optimisation techniques, possibly combined with high-performance computing and data analytics, for digital twins covering the full lifecycle of products and systems.
Laser based equipment in advanced and additive manufacturing
Actions will focus on assessment of technologies, systems, and processes and on digitisation opportunities, including the link between design tools and production and quality assurance. Actions should include the identification of high-potential business cases and support for the development of business models.
Innovative Artificial Intelligence in manufacturing
Experimentation of innovative Artificial Intelligence techniques in manufacturing, aggregating and analysing data from multiple sources, including e.g. MES (manufacturing execution systems) data, real-time process analytical data, in-line quality control, sound, video and olfactory input. Proposals are encouraged to build on the results of topic ICT-26-2018-2020.
Cognitive autonomous systems and human-robot interaction
Experimentation with cyber-physical systems in production environments, with special focus on reduction of waste, energy and resource consumption and efficient logistic processes. Adoption of robots safely cooperating with humans to support their work, improving both the efficiency and the working conditions and taking into account gender issues. In this topic, proposals should include partners that facilitate creation and experimentation with and by the arts[2] to ensure human acceptance of digital technologies in manufacturing and to stimulate new products and services.
Widening Digital Innovation Hubs
Experimentation through Digital Innovation Hubs in regions which are so far underrepresented[3] in Smart Anything Everywhere and I4MS, building on the work by projects “Smart Factories in new EU Member States”[4] and “DIHELP”[5]. The objective addresses all technology areas mentioned above and the technologies addressed in Smart Anything Everywhere and related areas[6]. The hubs should strongly collaborate with other Innovation Actions funded under the Hubs part of the Focus Area, e.g. through joint highly innovative cross-border experiments.
Proposals should focus on minimising the entry barriers and demonstrating the clear added value of technologies, making SMEs and mid-caps more competitive by transferring innovative solutions into the wider manufacturing community. Special attention should be given to security considerations and to the development of skills.
All proposed innovation actions may involve financial support to third parties (typically in the order of EUR 20.000 to 100.000 per third party). For this topic, the four requirements described in the introductory section “Support to hubs” have to be applied.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of up to EUR 8 million would allow each area to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts. To obtain an adequate coverage of all areas, at least one innovation action is supported for each of the areas, with the exception of the Widening Digital Innovation Hubs area, for which one innovation action is supported.
b) Coordination and Support Action (CSA)
The action will support the network of Digital Innovation Hubs and help achieve broad coverage in technological, application, innovation, and geographic terms, and link up with regional/national innovation initiatives, and other Digital Innovation Hubs. The action should build on the previously developed tools and innovation portal and aim to further improve them for the benefit of new Innovation Actions. The actions should also help in sharing best practices, dissemination, brokering between users and suppliers, leveraging investment and training and organise events. For these support actions, close cooperation is required with the European Factories of the Future Research Association (EFFRA[7]), and other CSAs funded under the Digital Innovation Hubs part of the Focus Area “Digitising and transforming European industry and services”.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of up to EUR 1 million would allow this area to be addressed appropriately.
Expected Impact:
Proposals should address all of the following impact criteria, providing metrics to measure success when appropriate.
Attract a significant number of new users of advanced ICT in the manufacturing sector, and more innovative technology suppliers, in particular SMEs and mid-caps.
A sustainable network of Digital Innovation Hubs, providing European added value to investments done at national and regional level in Digital Innovation Hubs and reaching a high leveraging effect on other sources of funding, in particular regional and national funding.

Citizens in a rapidly ageing European population are at greater risk of cognitive impairment, frailty and multiple chronic health conditions with considerable negative consequences for their independence, quality of life and for the sustainability of health and care systems. The challenge is to foster large-scale deployment of integrated digital solutions which will bring improved quality of life to citizens while demonstrating significant efficiency gains in health and care delivery across Europe.
Scope:
A mix of advanced ICT ranging from biophotonics to robotics, from artificial intelligence to big data and from IoT to smart wearables can address these challenges. A platform for smart living at home should integrate these technologies in an intelligent manner.
The pilots should build on open platforms, standardised ontologies, APIs and results from IoT-based smart living environments, service robotics and smart wearable & portable systems and clearly go beyond current state of the art in terms of scale, the capabilities for personalisation, adaptation, and user acceptance.
Pilots in the selected areas should clearly cover the supply and demand sides. For further expanding with other users, developers of additional applications, replication of the pilot through new sites, and complementary assessment of the acceptability of the use cases where appropriate, the actions in this topic may involve financial support to third parties as outlined in the chapeau 'Platforms and Pilots'.
A clear methodology and impact indicators for socio-economic impact assessment from using the platform should be included, where possible using the MAFEIP[1] framework. The number of users involved and duration of pilot services should be sufficient to ensure significance in impact analysis, with a minimum of 4 pilot sites in 4 countries.
The proposed pilots should also demonstrate feasibility of integration with other relevant application domains such as energy, transport, or smart cities, including interoperability, along with data security and integrity, and models for data sharing and valorisation are to be developed in order to create incentives for data aggregation across different platforms and application areas. Regulatory aspects and legal aspects of data ownership should be addressed. Relevant ethics and gender issues should be taken into account.
Proposals should address one of the two following areas:
Intelligent and personalised digital solutions for sustaining and extending healthy and independent living
The objective is to develop and deploy innovative and user-led digital solutions capable of supporting and extending healthy and independent living for older individuals who are facing permanently or temporarily reduced functionality and capabilities.
Innovative ways for ensuring user-friendly and accessible interface design and new intuitive ways of citizen interaction and trust creation are needed. Special emphasis should be given to viable concepts that ensure security and privacy by design, data protection, safety, security and trust in the resulting system and service delivery inside and outside the home.
Personalised early risk detection and intervention
The objective is to develop and deploy innovative and user-led solutions building on big data for personalised risk detection, advanced health monitoring and early interventions for people facing increased health and social risks. Proposals should design and demonstrate innovative personalised treatments and therapies based on early detection and risk avoidance. Because of the personal and sensitive nature of health data, special attention needs to be paid to trust, privacy and data protection.
For this topic, the four activities and impact criteria described in the chapeau 'Platforms and Pilots' have to be applied. Pilot projects are expected to contribute to the consolidation and coherence work that will be implemented by the CSA supporting the activities defined under ""DT-ICT-13-2019: Digital Platforms/Pilots Horizontal Activities"". This requires that they contribute to clustering their results of horizontal nature (interoperability approach, standards, security and privacy approaches, business validation and sustainability, methodologies, metrics, etc.).
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU between 15 and 20 EUR million for Innovation Actions would allow the areas to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts. At least one proposal should be funded for each of the above-mentioned areas
Expected Impact:
Emergence of European-led platform for smart and healthy and independent living at home;
Increased competitiveness of the European ICT industry in the domain, through enhanced interoperability, best practices for viable business and financing models and scalable markets;
Demonstrate links and build synergies with Member States' and regional initiatives in this area;
Improved and evidence-based efficiency of health and care systems with demonstrated added-value of underlying technologies;
Improved quality of life and health status for involved users and carers, with demonstrated added-value of underlying technologies;

","06 November 2018
","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
The challenge is to assess the potential benefits and risks of using disruptive technologies in public administrations as well as the social impact, including the impact on public servants, of using them for government processes and governance (e.g. for registers, for archiving, for tax collection, for decision-making processes etc.). The political, ethical, socio-economic, legal and cultural implications of disruptive technologies and their acceptance are important not only for public administrations, but also for citizens.
Scope:
a) Research and Innovation action (2018-2019):
The use of disruptive technologies (such as block-chain, big data analytics, Internet of Things, virtual reality, augmented reality, artificial intelligence, algorithmic techniques, simulations and gamification) in public administrations, public goods, public governance, public engagement, public-private partnerships, public third sector partnerships and policy impact assessment is growing and can be very beneficial. Yet, the real potential impact of such technologies and the ways in which they can disrupt the existing landscape of public services and legal procedures and can replace present solutions and processes are largely unknown. As a result, deploying these disruptive technologies in public administration requires a thorough assessment of their potential impact, benefits and risks for the delivery of public goods. Proposals should pilot the technology and should engage multidisciplinary partners, stakeholders and users to examine how emerging technologies can impact the public sector (including the impact on public servants and the relation between public services and citizens) and explore in a wide-ranging fashion the issues surrounding the use of these technologies in the public sector.
Proposals should also lead to the development of business plans that would ensure the long-term sustainability of the services offered based on the used technology.
b) Research and Innovation action (2020):
The use of disruptive technologies (such as artificial intelligence and big data analytics, block chain, Internet of Things, virtual and augmented reality, simulations or gamification) in public administrations and in governance including citizens engagement, decision support systems and policy impact assessments is growing. Although the potential positive impact of such technologies is high, the ways in which they can disrupt the existing landscape of public services and legal procedures and can replace present solutions and processes are largely unknown. As a result, deploying these disruptive technologies in public administration requires experimentations and a thorough assessment of their potential impact, benefits and risks (e.g. excluding some parts of the population due to age / gender / disabilities / social inequality / lack of e-literacy…). This includes especially their ethical and legal consequences. Proposals should pilot the technology and should engage multidisciplinary partners including those from social sciences and humanities, stakeholders and users (both public servants and citizens if appropriate) to examine how emerging technologies can impact the public sector (including the impact on public servants and the relation between public services and citizens) and explore in a wide-ranging fashion the issues surrounding the use of these technologies in the public sector (incl. e.g. the impact on capital, labour and knowledge). One of such issues will be experimenting with Digital Innovation Hubs (DIHs) [1] to engage innovative industrial suppliers such as startups, Govtech and innovative SMEs to pilot the adoption and use of disruptive technologies to improve public services.
Proposals should also lead to the development of implementations and/or business plans that would ensure the long-term sustainability of the services offered based on the used technology.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 3 and 4 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
The action will enable public authorities to develop pathways for the introduction of disruptive technologies while also addressing the societal challenges raised by such technologies. Based on a thorough understanding of users’ needs, the action will enhance knowledge on digital governance; develop new ways of providing public services, of ensuring public governance and of boosting public engagement with the help of disruptive technologies. It will also contribute to developing new practices, to optimising work processes and to integrating evidence-based decision-making processes in public services and in services such as health, education, culture, social welfare and mobility.

","Coordination and support action
","31 October 2017
","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
The Commission has identified the need to support the creation of voluntary participative networks related to Earth observation and Copernicus. The Copernicus Relays and Academy have been set up under their own funding and act as channels of promotion and target, targeting intermediate and end-user communities.
The Commission does not finance the members of the Copernicus Relays and Academy directly. The Commission finances:
The Copernicus Support Office, which provides non-financial support to members of the two networks (e.g. speakers, advice, promotional material);
The Copernicus User Uptake Framework Partnership Agreement, through which the Commission co-finances user uptake activities with Member States. Some of these activities might be organised by members of the Copernicus Relays or Academy, but will focus exclusively on stimulating the use of Copernicus data and information (e.g. awareness events, booths).
The Commission wishes to provide financial support to these two networks in order to strengthen their R&D dimension. These networks need to be better linked with research and innovation activities and with the ESA Space Solutions. Moreover, the expertise and tools developed by the Copernicus Relays and the Copernicus Academy need to be used also at the service of research and innovation with a view to boosting their innovation potential: and the uptake of space in general.
Scope:
Support the activities of the Copernicus Relays and the Copernicus Academy by:
Organising joint initiatives of interest to the network and its members, such as events and educational opportunities;
Sharing communication tools to ensure updates about the latest Copernicus events, lectures, new members, new training tools, best practices, and new funding opportunities;
Develop publications and reference lectures for training on Copernicus data and information use, under a public license and Including Copernicus-related material and modules in existing courses;
Fostering user uptake and spin-off strategies of the members, notably by interacting with the Copernicus entrusted entities, Copernicus partners and local actors;
Supporting the organisation of events and initiatives at local level to promote Copernicus to potential users.
Proposals shall demonstrate that they avoid overlap with the various activities financed under Copernicus, such as the Copernicus support office and Copernicus User Uptake Framework Partnership Agreement.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of EUR 1 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
This topic contributes to the Horizon 2020 focus area ""Digitising and transforming European industry and services"".
Expected Impact:
Strengthen the synergies and cooperation between members by sharing knowledge building, education experiences, best practices and Copernicus-related research and applications outcome and by enabling developed innovations to ‘hit the market’ as quickly as possible;
Build up a knowledge culture and a strategic think-tank around the benefits of the Copernicus programme and its potential for both public services needs and societal challenges;
Increase awareness about Copernicus toward all potential user communities.
Expand these two networks to other European Regions and to other space technologies (e.g. Galileo) and activities from other major space and innovation actors (such as those of regional clusters, national space agencies and the ESA).

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Copernicus, the Union's Earth observation and monitoring programme produces a wealth of data and information services on the Earth, its lands, atmosphere, oceans and inland waters, as well as on climate change and in support of disaster management and security. Copernicus data and information services are available with a free and open data licence.
Copernicus data is an integral part of the European Data Economy. Europe needs to strengthen its position as provider of products and services based on data, enabling new market opportunities.
Copernicus data value will be greatly enhanced by its integration with data assets contributed by other vertical domains (i.e. not necessarily from the space/geospatial sector) as well as by leveraging the synergies with EGNOS/Galileo to seize new market opportunities. Many vertical domains, other than space, can benefit from the use of Copernicus.
Mature software technologies such as big data processing and linking technologies, machine learning and artificial intelligence, are widely developed also within the LEIT-ICT Work Programmes of H2020, shall be adopted to offer user-friendly solutions at the scale of the large quantities of data involved. They shall be adopted to contribute to the digitization challenges of the European industry by opening up innovative business avenues and to support societal challenges.
Real-world industrial/commercial requirements, or societal needs, shall drive the Innovation Actions so that the projects’ results can find their logical path towards market adoption.
Scope:
Actions under this topic should be instrumental to help European companies innovate, develop and bring to market new or improved products and services by exploiting Copernicus data assets and, whenever relevant, the link with European satellite positioning/navigation/timing technologies.
Copernicus data will be at the core of the data value chains and integration activates needed to fulfil the industrial requirements that will drive the proposals.
Proposals should adopt state-of-the-art ICT technologies, such as big data processing and linking technologies, machine learning and artificial intelligence to address the challenges of making sense of large volumes of diverse data from distributed sources, at the scale required to address European and global challenges.
Proposers are strongly encouraged to make use of existing European data infrastructures such as (but not limited to) Copernicus’ DIAS platforms, European open data portals, industrial data platforms, and explore synergies with EGNOS/Galileo signals and services whenever those are relevant. Use and re-use of existing data and computing assets is also strongly recommended.
The participation of industry is required to define the project’s industrial requirements from the very beginning of the action and to take ownership of the results.
End users (i.e. professional experts and decision-makers as opposed to researchers or software developers) should also be involved to rigorously test the project’s solutions to make sure the human factor is considered appropriately.
Proposals must demonstrate that they have access to appropriately large, complex and realistic data sets, in addition to Copernicus. The data assets to be used in the Action should be described in the proposal.
Solid, quantitative and innovative business models should support the proposal giving evidence of the expected industrial, commercial, or societal benefit, and demonstrating a plan towards sustainability after the project’s end.
A clear distribution of IPRs amongst the members of the consortium is expected.
For proposals under this topic:
The participation of at least one industrial partner is mandatory, and the participation of SMEs and start-ups is encouraged;
Involvement of post-graduate scientists, engineers and researchers and promotion of gender balance is also encouraged, for example through professional work experience or through fellowships/scholarships as applicable;
A business plan and evidence of user engagement is compulsory and is to be provided as part of the proposal, to demonstrate the user need and sustainability of the project.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 1 and 3 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
Establishment of new sustainable data value chains with Copernicus data at their core with a commercial value;
Substantial increase in the market of the number of products and services enabled by integrating Copernicus data across sectors with state-of-the-art innovative technologies, able to generate growth and new jobs;
Enhance European industry’s potential to take advantage of market opportunities and establish leadership in the field, as well as boost business activity;
Increased market share for European companies in the supply of innovative geospatial products and services.

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
One of the main challenges for the sustainability of the European space industrial fabric and the delivery of cutting-edge scientific achievements is to maintain highly qualified scientists, engineers and technicians including their lifelong learning. Space science and technology constitute important inspirational tools for exciting and motivating young people, and encouraging them to choose space related careers. Space is also a domain that easily captures the interest of students towards education paths in the fields of science, technology, engineering and mathematics.
Positive exposure to and experiences in the space domain can contribute moreover to building long-term partnerships between peoples from different cultural backgrounds and countries inside and outside Europe. The challenge is to design and run sustainable education and outreach activities which can act as catalysers, both inside and outside the classroom, motivating teachers and students at different ages and education levels.
Scope:
The main delivery of the action shall be an initiative capable of attracting the interest of a significant number of students towards space and space-related themes, while creating at the same time a relevant impact on their families and the general public in terms of news coverage, social-media interest, stakeholders’ involvement. The action shall engage academia and educators involved in different education levels, targeting different demographics including young children and teenagers.
The key advancements of the European space programmes should be given a privileged position, but the main objective should remain attracting the interest of students for space, space-related subjects and steer them towards education paths in the fields of science, technology, engineering and mathematics.
Proposals should take into account similar activities of ESA and national education programmes. They could focus in the context of the classroom or outside the normal classroom environment, making use of space educational centres or online resources, including contests and public exhibitions (for instance in science museums). Particular attention should be paid to stimulating interest amongst female students and reaching children in underprivileged communities.
Activities shall also aim at identifying links with the Knowledge and Innovation Communities (KICs) of the European Innovation Institute of Technology (EIT) and possible scope for dedicated activities for space.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of EUR 1 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
This topic contributes to the Horizon 2020 focus area ""Digitising and transforming European industry and services"".
Expected Impact:
Promote the network European space education and outreach actors and reach out to a significant number of students, their families and the general public.
Achieve a significant coverage by media and attention by stakeholders and help increase the political support for European space programmes and initiatives within the EU and national Parliaments.
Increase the number of students that opt for a technical career related to space when compared to the general population of students in their cohorts;
Promote research in collaboration with universities.

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
The challenge is to assess the potential benefits and risks of using disruptive technologies in public administrations as well as the social impact, including the impact on public servants, of using them for government processes and governance (e.g. for registers, for archiving, for tax collection, for decision-making processes etc.). The political, ethical, socio-economic, legal and cultural implications of disruptive technologies and their acceptance are important not only for public administrations, but also for citizens.
Scope:
a) Research and Innovation action (2018-2019):
The use of disruptive technologies (such as block-chain, big data analytics, Internet of Things, virtual reality, augmented reality, artificial intelligence, algorithmic techniques, simulations and gamification) in public administrations, public goods, public governance, public engagement, public-private partnerships, public third sector partnerships and policy impact assessment is growing and can be very beneficial. Yet, the real potential impact of such technologies and the ways in which they can disrupt the existing landscape of public services and legal procedures and can replace present solutions and processes are largely unknown. As a result, deploying these disruptive technologies in public administration requires a thorough assessment of their potential impact, benefits and risks for the delivery of public goods. Proposals should pilot the technology and should engage multidisciplinary partners, stakeholders and users to examine how emerging technologies can impact the public sector (including the impact on public servants and the relation between public services and citizens) and explore in a wide-ranging fashion the issues surrounding the use of these technologies in the public sector.
Proposals should also lead to the development of business plans that would ensure the long-term sustainability of the services offered based on the used technology.
b) Research and Innovation action (2020):
The use of disruptive technologies (such as artificial intelligence and big data analytics, block chain, Internet of Things, virtual and augmented reality, simulations or gamification) in public administrations and in governance including citizens engagement, decision support systems and policy impact assessments is growing. Although the potential positive impact of such technologies is high, the ways in which they can disrupt the existing landscape of public services and legal procedures and can replace present solutions and processes are largely unknown. As a result, deploying these disruptive technologies in public administration requires experimentations and a thorough assessment of their potential impact, benefits and risks (e.g. excluding some parts of the population due to age / gender / disabilities / social inequality / lack of e-literacy…). This includes especially their ethical and legal consequences. Proposals should pilot the technology and should engage multidisciplinary partners including those from social sciences and humanities, stakeholders and users (both public servants and citizens if appropriate) to examine how emerging technologies can impact the public sector (including the impact on public servants and the relation between public services and citizens) and explore in a wide-ranging fashion the issues surrounding the use of these technologies in the public sector (incl. e.g. the impact on capital, labour and knowledge). One of such issues will be experimenting with Digital Innovation Hubs (DIHs) [1] to engage innovative industrial suppliers such as startups, Govtech and innovative SMEs to pilot the adoption and use of disruptive technologies to improve public services.
Proposals should also lead to the development of implementations and/or business plans that would ensure the long-term sustainability of the services offered based on the used technology.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 3 and 4 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
The action will enable public authorities to develop pathways for the introduction of disruptive technologies while also addressing the societal challenges raised by such technologies. Based on a thorough understanding of users’ needs, the action will enhance knowledge on digital governance; develop new ways of providing public services, of ensuring public governance and of boosting public engagement with the help of disruptive technologies. It will also contribute to developing new practices, to optimising work processes and to integrating evidence-based decision-making processes in public services and in services such as health, education, culture, social welfare and mobility.

While a key mission of the cultural heritage sector is to provide inclusive access, some socio-cultural groups are still not sufficiently integrated in cultural heritage experiences. The challenge is to improve the design of cultural experiences by enhancing participatory and collaborative approaches and by fostering mutual cultural understanding and resilient strategies.
Scope:
Proposals should develop strategies for fostering collaborative and participative approaches to cultural encounters via communication channels such as social media platforms, participatory approaches, art and co-designed activities. Proposals should consider both tangible and intangible heritage, researching new applications and tools that allow for a more inclusive approach such as digital tagging of objects or co-authoring of societal and place-based memories. The active involvement and engagement with, different groups or communities such as migrants and other communities at risk of exclusion should be promoted. Proposals should design options for these social groups to review or shape both contemporary and historical content, contribute new material or customise and personalise cultural heritage and digital humanities content in a meaningful and effective way. Collaborative tools and applications should help the cultural tourism sectors and cultural heritage institutions, NGOs, community organisations etc. in Europe and beyond to enhance the analysis and understanding of cultures and communities.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 3 and 4 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
The action will contribute to fostering cultural diversity and social cohesion and to the recognition of multiple identities and voices. It will also have a positive impact on cultural institutions by attracting contributions from and boosting involvement of new audiences. In addition, the action will provide disciplines such as computing, design and the social science and humanities with new research tools.

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
The challenge is to assess the potential benefits and risks of using disruptive technologies in public administrations as well as the social impact, including the impact on public servants, of using them for government processes and governance (e.g. for registers, for archiving, for tax collection, for decision-making processes etc.). The political, ethical, socio-economic, legal and cultural implications of disruptive technologies and their acceptance are important not only for public administrations, but also for citizens.
Scope:
a) Research and Innovation action (2018-2019):
The use of disruptive technologies (such as block-chain, big data analytics, Internet of Things, virtual reality, augmented reality, artificial intelligence, algorithmic techniques, simulations and gamification) in public administrations, public goods, public governance, public engagement, public-private partnerships, public third sector partnerships and policy impact assessment is growing and can be very beneficial. Yet, the real potential impact of such technologies and the ways in which they can disrupt the existing landscape of public services and legal procedures and can replace present solutions and processes are largely unknown. As a result, deploying these disruptive technologies in public administration requires a thorough assessment of their potential impact, benefits and risks for the delivery of public goods. Proposals should pilot the technology and should engage multidisciplinary partners, stakeholders and users to examine how emerging technologies can impact the public sector (including the impact on public servants and the relation between public services and citizens) and explore in a wide-ranging fashion the issues surrounding the use of these technologies in the public sector.
Proposals should also lead to the development of business plans that would ensure the long-term sustainability of the services offered based on the used technology.
b) Research and Innovation action (2020):
The use of disruptive technologies (such as artificial intelligence and big data analytics, block chain, Internet of Things, virtual and augmented reality, simulations or gamification) in public administrations and in governance including citizens engagement, decision support systems and policy impact assessments is growing. Although the potential positive impact of such technologies is high, the ways in which they can disrupt the existing landscape of public services and legal procedures and can replace present solutions and processes are largely unknown. As a result, deploying these disruptive technologies in public administration requires experimentations and a thorough assessment of their potential impact, benefits and risks (e.g. excluding some parts of the population due to age / gender / disabilities / social inequality / lack of e-literacy…). This includes especially their ethical and legal consequences. Proposals should pilot the technology and should engage multidisciplinary partners including those from social sciences and humanities, stakeholders and users (both public servants and citizens if appropriate) to examine how emerging technologies can impact the public sector (including the impact on public servants and the relation between public services and citizens) and explore in a wide-ranging fashion the issues surrounding the use of these technologies in the public sector (incl. e.g. the impact on capital, labour and knowledge). One of such issues will be experimenting with Digital Innovation Hubs (DIHs) [1] to engage innovative industrial suppliers such as startups, Govtech and innovative SMEs to pilot the adoption and use of disruptive technologies to improve public services.
Proposals should also lead to the development of implementations and/or business plans that would ensure the long-term sustainability of the services offered based on the used technology.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 3 and 4 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
The action will enable public authorities to develop pathways for the introduction of disruptive technologies while also addressing the societal challenges raised by such technologies. Based on a thorough understanding of users’ needs, the action will enhance knowledge on digital governance; develop new ways of providing public services, of ensuring public governance and of boosting public engagement with the help of disruptive technologies. It will also contribute to developing new practices, to optimising work processes and to integrating evidence-based decision-making processes in public services and in services such as health, education, culture, social welfare and mobility.

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
The ICT are generally valued in terms of skill development, learning and future employability of young generations. Educational and training institutions are getting equipped with ICT tools and educators are trained for designing activities aimed at digital literacy and for making use of media for educational purposes. The time children and young people spend on ICT has been increasing in school, at home and for leisure. However, research on the impact of ICT on health, lifestyles, wellbeing, safety and security has identified potential threats. Moreover, the quantity and quality of digital media use vary accordingly to family backgrounds, with the risk of widening the educational divide between children from favoured and disadvantaged groups. The challenge is to develop a solid and independent multidisciplinary and longitudinal knowledge base in relation to the 0 to 18 years old age group that explains under which conditions harmful versus beneficial effects occur so that effective social, educational, health and online safety policies, practices and market regulation can be developed.
Scope:
a) Research and Innovation action
Proposals should assess the online behaviour of children and young people as well as their use of digital content and devices by socio-economic, gender and age group, with attention to motivations for using ICT at home, for leisure and in schools or training institutions. Robust methodologies for measuring and explaining long-term impacts in areas such as skills and competencies (i.e. digital and media literacy, innovation and creativity, learning and socio-emotional competencies and more specific labour market relevant skills), wellbeing and (mental) health or other relevant aspects of brain development should be developed and tested across EU level. Methodologies should focus on understanding why and how some children and adolescents benefit from ICT use while others seem to be impacted negatively. Evidence-based models identifying and analysing at-risk groups can be developed. Proposals should take into account diversity as appropriate (age, cultural, social and economic background, gender etc.) and address the impact of ICT use on education inequalities. (Lack of) equity of access to ICT across social groups should also be considered. Children and young people should be active collaborators in the project.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU in the order of EUR 3 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
b) Coordination and Support action[1]
This coordination and support action should aim at the establishment of a Pan-European platform to co-ordinate research activities in the EU Member States and Associated Countries with the purpose of developing a knowledge base, and filling current gaps, into how children and young people behave and interact online as well as the risks they may encounter while online. Proposals should pay particular attention to the vulnerability of children and young people in the digital environment and propose solutions for building online resilience, while also taking cultural and gender-related issues into account. Through the proposed platform, researchers across different countries, disciplines and approaches should share existing knowledge, fill research gaps, build capacity and work towards a consensual framework for future work. Based on the evidence base, policy recommendations should be developed on how to best protect and ensure positive online experiences for children and young people. In addition, emerging issues such as the rise of hate speech and radicalisation should be addressed.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU in the order of EUR 1.5 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
Explanatory models will inform relevant stakeholders and practitioners on the long-term effects of ICT on child development and on practices that maximise risks (risk factors), minimise risks (resilience factors) and maximise benefits (enhancing factors). The action will contribute to better regulation (e.g. labelling, evaluation of ICT educational tools, protection of online users) and to a safer and more beneficial use of digital technologies at home, for leisure and in educational settings by children and young people. It will formulate recommendations in support of national and European policies in the field. The action will enhance cooperation between schools and families (school-community partnership) in ensuring safe and productive ways of using ICTs. It will also improve statistical data, generate innovative quantitative and qualitative methods as needed, and expand the knowledge base on in-depth case studies.

Specific challenge: Public authorities play a key role in the reduction of EU energy consumption and the increase of renewable energy capacity. For instance Member States must produce and implement National Energy Efficiency Action Plans (NEEAPs) and National Renewable Energy Action Plans. They also have the obligation to produce detailed action plans in specific sectors such as the renovation of buildings or the application of high-efficiency cogeneration and efficient district heating and cooling systems. Local and regional authorities are also developing plans at their own level and other public authorities play an important role too; national energy regulatory authorities for instance should provide incentives for grid operators (heat, cold, and electricity) to enable network users to produce renewable energies and implement energy efficiency measures.
Doing this requires multidisciplinary skills to e.g. assess different cross-sector sustainable energy options, according to technical, environmental, economic and social criteria. It also requires skills to engage stakeholders in both the definition and implementation of the solutions, and to secure funding.
The situation regarding the availability of these skills varies from country to country; e.g. while certain public authorities have a long tradition of using energy performance contracting, others have not tried yet; or while a few Member States oblige large cities to develop urban mobility plans, such plans are not common practice in other countries.
Scope: Proposals demonstrating an innovative approach in empowering public authorities to develop, finance and implement ambitious sustainable energy policies and plans (for instance under the Covenant of Mayors initiative), on the basis of reliable data and analyses. Public actors should be encouraged to look at sectors with high energy saving potential such as buildings, industry and urban mobility. The geographical coverage should be well justified on the basis of European added-value. Capacity building should be an integral part of project proposals.
The following actions are part of the scope:
Raising the capacity of Member States to fulfil their obligation under the new Energy Efficiency Directive.
Enabling national energy regulatory authorities to address demand issues (e.g. demand response, tariff design, assessment of generation adequacy assessment).
Capacity building on integrated energy, transport mobility and land-use planning at community and city-level.
Supporting public authorities in better linking up local, regional and national levels for delivering integrated sustainable energy action planning and projects to achieve synergies and economies of scale.
Establishing new or exploiting existing networks and other mechanisms to spread knowledge and facilitating the exchange of experiences and best practice on sustainable energy.
Large-scale capacity building on innovative financing to specific groups of public authorities, such as national, local and regional authorities, energy agencies, structural and cohesion funds managing authorities.
Defining and implementing standard energy saving packages for households, public sector and industry in particular under Article 7 of the Energy Efficiency Directive.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 1 and 1.5 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected impact: Impacts must be measured in terms of number of public officers influenced and number of new or improved policies and plans. The number of final consumers impacted should also be measured in millions of people. In addition, proposals targeting governments should also demonstrate that they accelerate the implementation of the new Energy Efficiency Directive.

Specific challenge: demand response enables end users to participate actively in energy markets and profit from optimal price conditions, making the grid (heat, cold, electricity) more efficient and contributing to the integration of renewable energy sources. The Energy Efficiency Directive adopted in 2012 contains provisions to encourage market actors to facilitate demand response. At the building level, increasing use of energy management technologies for both thermal and electric loads will act as an enabler for the deployment of demand response in both residential and non-residential buildings (e.g. offices). Such systems may be integrated with thermic/electric storage technologies and micro combined heat and power installations (CHP). Considering the important contribution of buildings and occupants to energy efficiency, there is therefore a need for ensuring that buildings have proper energy management systems in place to ensure consumers' engagement and demand response activations.
Scope: At the level of a block of buildings, the focus should be on real time optimisation of energy demand, storage and supply (including self-production when applicable) using intelligent energy management systems with the objective of reducing the difference between peak power demand and minimum night time demand, thus reducing costs and greenhouse gas emissions. Cost-effective and interoperable solutions that do not compromise the comfort of occupants should be demonstrated for a block of buildings consisting of at least 3 different buildings in real life operating conditions. Solutions should be compatible with smart grids and open international standards and with the distribution network infrastructure.
The activities are expected to be implemented at TRL 6-7 (please see part G of the General Annexes).
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 3 and 5 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected impact: Proposals showing that demand response can be implemented at the level of blocks of buildings with the help of intelligent energy management systems and without unreasonable effort and complexity while triggering substantial energy and cost savings. Moreover, proposals that shed light on the added value of installing demand response facilities for building blocks instead of individual buildings and on the willingness of consumers to participate in demand response solutions. Impacts should be measured in energy and cost savings. Impacts should also be measured for the willingness and capability of consumers to participate in demand response solutions.

Specific challenge: Considering the large volume of public spending (19% of EU GDP, or roughly EUR 2,200 bn in 2009[1]), the public sector constitute an important driver to stimulate market transformation towards more sustainable energy products, buildings and services. To this regard, the recent Energy Efficiency Directive requires for instance that central governments purchase only products, services and buildings with high energy-efficiency performance. However, there are many operational barriers related to sustainable energy public spending such as the lack of knowledge, practical training and tailored guidelines; the lack of willingness to change procurement habits; or perceived legal uncertainties.
Scope:
        Proposals improving the capacity of public authorities and national/regional/local procurement authorities in purchasing best available sustainable energy products, buildings or services.  Project proposals should address the lack of professional procurement training, the lack of experience in implementing sustainable procurement practices and strategies, and/or the lack of sharing and co-operation among procurers. They should where appropriate rely on the use of cost – benefit analysis (e.g. using a life-cycle approach). Actions should include sharing of best practices and involve large multipliers such as central purchasing organisations.
        Support public authorities in procuring fast-evolving information and communication technologies such as Green Data Centres. Project proposals should consider the risks associated to rapid technological evolution, a dynamic industry, scalability and the need for tailored (i.e. not off the shelf) solutions by suppliers. Activities to support networking of public procurers or the use of PPI (Public Procurement of Innovative solutions) or PCP (Pre-commercial Procurement) are to be included.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 1 and 1.5 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected impact:Every million Euro of EU supportis expected to trigger the launch of public tenders for the purchase of sustainable energy products, buildings or services resulting in savings of more than 25 GWh[2] per year of energy savings and/or renewable energy production. Proposals should also increase the skills of public procurers and the market uptake of innovative solutions.

Previous initiatives have demonstrated the usefulness of market surveillance activities[2]. However to ensure full implementation of product efficiency legislation, it has also been proven that these activities should be improved.
Scope: Proposals should focus on building up the monitoring, verification and enforcement of the EU's energy-related products policy, in particular for those products that represent the highest energy saving potential (e.g. electric motors, water and space heating and cooling equipment, lighting). Proposals should support higher level of surveillance activities and go beyond product testing activities. They should not replace activities that are under the responsibility of Member States[3] but add European value to these activities (e.g. execution of joint activities, exchange of information, development of common methods, protocols or checklists, etc.). Actions must involve the relevant market surveillance authorities and consumers’ (or other end users') associations as appropriate, and demonstrate a high transnational added value.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 1.5 and 2 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected impact: for market surveillance proposals every million Euro of EU support is expected to generate savings of at least 15 GWh/year of energy losses avoided from non-compliance[4]. In addition, proposals should result in an increase of confidence among purchasers, manufacturers and retailers. They should also contribute to the enforcement of EU product legislation.

Specific Challenge: Energy efficiency is playing a growing role in local, national and European policy development. It is a complex issue spanning different disciplines like engineering and social sciences. To formulate long-term strategies and define cost-effective policies, policy makers need to better understand the macroeconomic impacts of energy efficiency, and, at the microeconomic level, the evolution of energy (and where appropriate exergy[1]) efficiency, the influence of consumer behaviour, the influence of institutional factors,  and the implications of trends in society and technologies..
Scope:Foresight socio-economic activities informing the debate on the development and monitoring of energy efficiency strategies, taking a forward looking approach to the horizon 2030 and beyond. Proposals may also research the multiple benefits of energy efficiency or look at the evolution of social, economic, cultural and educational barriers. They may also study major trends in society and their implications, or advance knowledge of consumer behaviour (e.g. rebound effect) and the impact of institutional factors. They can either adopt a cross-sectorial approach or be specific to certain relevant sectors. Proposals may feed the development of energy efficiency strategies, policies and programmes at all governance levels. Where appropriate, they should take gender issues into account as well as existing macroeconomic and microeconomic models and results of socio-economic sciences and humanities. A specific priority will be given to the development of micro-economic analysis of the updated energy efficiency measures.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of around EUR 1 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected impact: Positive impact on energy efficiency policy development, evidenced for instance by their reference into impact assessments, strategy papers or other policy documents.

Specific challenge: Action is needed to remove non-technological (including legislation) barriers to exploit the full potential of efficient heating and cooling solutions. This involves integrated planning and integration of heating/cooling into the territorial context; active participation of local administrations; adaptation and compatibility/connectivity with low energy building standards; inclusion of heating/cooling in building renovation strategies; and empowerment and involvement of consumers through innovative metering, billing and complaint handling processes.
Scope:Project proposals should focus on one or more of the following areas:
Individual heating and cooling: Innovative measures to accelerate the replacement of old, inefficient space heaters and packaged cooling systems with products having A+++ to A+ energy labels. The replacement should not lock out energy savings from other energy measures in the rest of the building/system.
Inspection of heating and cooling systems: support for the implementation of inspection in heating and cooling systems as indicated in Articles 14 and 15 of the EPBD. This includes actions using monitoring and ICT as ways to reduce the need for physical inspections. Actions could also support the provision of advice to users as well as monitoring the results of advice.
For industrial heating/cooling:
deploy effective heating/cooling solutions in industry that integrate demand and supply.
deploy renewable heating and cooling solutions in relevant industrial sectors (e.g. food and drink industries).
contribute to identifying, developing, and promoting new markets for the recovery of heat from industry by putting stakeholders together, including activities aiming at supporting public acceptance of waste heat recovery projects.
exchange of information and knowledge.
Energy supply systems[1]: Proposals should lead to the opening up of new markets for the most efficient large, medium or small scale systems, potentially including solar cooling systems.  They should build on experience from existing best practice examples. Proposals could address the development and implementation of: a) support and incentive schemes, b) organisational, managerial and business innovative models and c) new regulatory frameworks and codes that lead to substantial growth and improved transparency. Proposals could include activities aimed at improving the performance of existing systems as an example to encourage further use of these technologies.
For district heating/cooling industry: develop good practice, licensing criteria, efficiency benchmarks and consumer protection codes to improve the transparency of the market and increase consumer trust. Ensure exchange of information, knowledge of using best practice examples and knowledge of consumer practices, motivations and barriers.
Develop and demonstrate the tools and methodologies required to conduct the heating and cooling planning procedures necessary at the member state and EU level, such as energy system analysis using CHP and energy storage, geographical information systems (GIS) for matching heat supply and demand, as well as measures to overcome implementation challenges. These should make it possible for local communities and member states to develop strategies for the achievement of the overall EU targets.
Consortia should include or engage with the relevant market actors such as industry (equipment and fuel suppliers), installers, real estate developers, public authorities, energy services companies, designers and end user groups / consumer associations. Due consideration should be given to costs and reliability. Furthermore, where appropriate, proposals should devise mechanisms to secure funding for energy efficiency investments.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 1.5 and 2 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact: More favourable market conditions for efficient heating and cooling solutions and opening up of new markets.
Every million Euro of EU support should in the short term lead to the reduction of at least 25 GWh/yr of fossil fuels for heating and cooling. Significant impacts should also be measured in terms of investment made by stakeholders in sustainable energy; number of policy makers influenced; number of people with increased skills; or number of people changing their behaviour.

Deadline date","Scope:
Specific challenge: Between 2000 and 2010, energy efficiency in industry has on average improved by 1.3% per year[1]. However by using existing cost-effective energy solutions, the industry sector could further reduce its consumption by at least 13%[2], thus gaining in competitiveness and save nearly 40 Mtoe a year. Obtaining larger savings in industry can also be achieved by introducing new affordable intelligent energy solutions that secures more uptime in production chains.
Scope: Activities should focus on removing market barriers, in particular the lack of expertise and information on energy management. Proposals should primarily address the uptake of cross-cutting innovative technologies, such as energy efficient electric motor driven systems and steam/hot water generation, because these represent 75% of the potential savings in industry[3]. They should also consider total-site energy management schemes and system optimization methodologies to identify saving potentials, monitor progress, and design energy recovery and energy storage solutions. Proposals should put in place mechanisms to secure funding for energy efficiency investments and facilitate the continuation of the activities beyond the project lifetime. The use of renewable energies and waste heat recovery should be encouraged where it is cost-effective. Energy-intensive industries should be prioritised as they account for 70% of industrial energy use. Processes (e.g. drying) which represent a relatively high share of energy consumption in industry should also be considered where appropriate.
The following areas or their combination are also eligible for funding:
Industrial systems efficiency benchmarking: Devise methods and tools including ICT to compare and benchmark the energy performance of industrial systems and processes, and develop guidelines for tailored measures, in particular in energy-intensive industries. Such methods and tools should be based on existing standards where applicable.
Development of sector-specific technology pathways towards 2050 to target the most energy-intensive industrial sectors
Energy management in SMEs and industry: Improve the availability of skilled energy auditors and energy managers and the diffusion of energy management systems and best practices. Develop instruments to ensure the availability of updated, comprehensive and usable information on energy efficiency for industries. Address the issue of access to finance for the actual implementation of energy efficiency upgrades.
Human and organizational challenges: Analysis of motivations, behaviour, perception, and barriers for the involved actors (from decision makers to employees) in the sector, and knowledge about organizational factors influencing energy efficiency.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 1.5 and 2 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected impact: for capacity building projects, every million Euro of EU support is expected to increase the skills of hundreds of people working in the sector, resulting in savings of at least 25 GWh per year. All proposals should demonstrate a significant impact in terms of improved competitiveness; larger investments made by stakeholders in sustainable energy; primary energy savings; better implementation of energy-efficiency policies; number of policy makers influenced; number of people with increased skills; and/or number of people changing their behaviour.

Specific challenge: Significant efforts are required to mobilise all relevant stakeholders, draw up investment inventories, develop feasibility studies, financial engineering instruments, and to address legal and procurement issues.
In this context, it is necessary to support project promoters through dedicated project development assistance facilities and capacity building and thus demonstrate the viability and positive impacts of aggregated, sustainable energy investments.
Scope: Project development assistance support will be provided to public and private project promoters such as public/private infrastructure operators, energy service companies (ESCOs), retail chains, cities and SMEs/industry, leading to innovative, bankable and aggregated sustainable energy investment schemes and projects of EUR 6 million – EUR 50 million. The support will be conditional on mobilized investments. The focus should be on existing public and private buildings, retail energy market infrastructure[1], commercial and logistic properties and sites. The major objective of supported projects will be to demonstrate the financial viability and sustainability of large-scale sustainable energy investments. Proposals must have an exemplary/showcase dimension, be replicable as well as deliver organisational innovation in the mobilisation of the investments and/or the financial approach. Innovation should be demonstrated taking into account the situation in the targeted country. Proposals must also include a clear action plan to communicate across Europe towards potential replicators. Further, supported projects will be required to participate in a monitoring and evaluation exercise run by the Commission (see the part on ‘Other Actions’ of this work programme, item B.1.1.14, for details).
Project development assistance activities implemented through this topic are complementary to the ELENA facility[2] implemented by the EIB (see ‘other actions’ B.1.4 for details).
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 0.5 and 2 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.

Specific challenge: The public sector has an exemplary role to play (in particular as regards the management of public assets) in addressing the market deficiencies[1] by setting the stable regulatory environment and engaging in dialogue with the key stakeholders to improve the legal and financial framework and to put in place innovative financing schemes. However, the deployed public funds have to be matched and multiplied by the private sector capital, to address the financing gap.
The energy services industry together with the financial sector also need to develop new business models in order to better monetise future energy savings and tackle new sectors to reach its potential turnover of some EUR 25 billion per year[2].
Scope:
Proposals focusing on the roll-out of business models for innovative energy efficiency services (e.g. energy performance contracting), enabling to fully monetise the resulting energy savings.
Proposals replicating successful innovative financing solutions already implemented across the EU as well as successful innovative energy services. Particular attention should be given to innovative solutions enabling aggregation, securitisation, project bundling, structuring of clearing houses, or developing new investment mechanisms (e.g. crowd-funding for sustainable energy).
Proposals implementing large-scale capacity building for public authorities and SMEs to set-up or use innovative financing schemes for sustainable energy.

Deadline date","Scope:
Specific challenge: Development and deployment of integrated, secure, permanent, on-demand service-driven, privacy-compliant and sustainable e-infrastructures incorporating advanced computing resources and software are essential in order to increase the capacity to manage, store and analyse extremely large, heterogeneous and complex datasets[1], including text mining of large corpora. These e-infrastructures need to provide services cutting across a wide-range of scientific communities and addressing a diversity of computational requirements, legal constraints and requirements, system and service architectures, formats, types, vocabularies and legacy practices of scientific communities that generate, analyse and use the data.
Scope: Proposals should address at least one of the first five (5) activities, or activities 6, 7 or 8 individually. Proposers are encouraged to leverage on prior work on open prototype services and to use discoverable service catalogues, common APIs, service-level agreements (SLAs) and transparent billing.
(1) Establishing a federated pan-European data e-infrastructure to provide cost-effective and interoperable solutions for data management and long term preservation. The needs for data access, storage, replication, annotation, search, compute, analysis and reuse of information across disciplines should be accommodated in different research and education contexts.  All these functions should expose standard interfaces for interoperation with other data sources to aggregate them or to be aggregated, considering also ethical and regulatory requirements for sensitive data (e.g. patient data). Sustainability is of paramount importance, therefore robust business models should be proposed to encourage investment from all stakeholders. Foreseen challenges are technical, legal and organisational, including engaging e-infrastructure operators and other service providers (such as those receiving support under topics EINFRA-2-2014, EINFRA-3-2014, and EINFRA-7-2014);
(2) Services to ensure the quality and reliability of the e-infrastructure, including certification mechanisms for repositories and certification services to test and benchmark capabilities in terms of resilience and service continuity of e-infrastructures;
(3) Federating institutional and, if possible, private data management and curation tools and services used across or at some point of the full data lifecycle, including approaches for identification of open data sources and data collected with sensitive or restricted access features. Services and tools should be federated on the basis of an open architecture and should offer or coordinate support to the development of Data Management Plans, in particular for Horizon 2020 project participants;
(4) Large scale virtualisation of data/compute centre resources to achieve on-demand compute capacities, improve flexibility for data analysis and avoid unnecessary costly large data transfers.
(5) Development and adoption of a standards-based computing platform (with open software stack) that can be deployed on different hardware and e-infrastructures (such as clouds providing infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS), HPC, grid infrastructures…) to abstract application development and execution from available (possibly remote) computing systems. This platform should be capable of federating multiple commercial and/or public cloud resources or services and deliver Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) adapted to the scientific community with a short learning curve. Adequate coordination and interoperability with existing e-infrastructures (including GÉANT, EGI, PRACE and others) is recommended
(6) Support to the evolution of EGI (European Grid Infrastructure) towards a flexible compute/data infrastructure capable of federating and enabling the sharing of resources of any kind (public or private, grid or cloud, etc.) in order to offer computing and storage services to the whole European scientific community. The proposal will address operations for supplying services (IaaS, PaaS, SaaS) at European level, engagement of and tailoring of services to new user communities and dissemination activities.
(7) Proof of concept and prototypes of data infrastructure-enabling software (e.g. for databases and data mining) for extremely large or highly heterogeneous data sets scaling to zetabytes and trillion of objects. Clean slate approaches to data management targeting 2020+ 'data factory' requirements of research communities and large scale facilities (e.g. ESFRI projects) are encouraged.
(8) Enable the creation of a platform and infrastructure for mining text aggregated from different sources/publishers that responds to the needs of users (researchers). This includes the definition of technical requirements (e.g. on interoperability, metadata standards and aggregation of new services) as well as addressing legal and contractual issues to serve the needs of text mining communities. The project should also provide consulting and counselling services to solve problems related with the legal framework and permissions to text mine collections, and to advise researchers on the benefits and practice of text mining. The development of the proposed platform and services should be informed by the studies on policy and licencing issues associated with Text and Data Mining that will be funded from the Call for “Developing governance for the advancement of Responsible Research and Innovation” in the ""Science with and for Society"" Work Programme (topic GARRI.3.2014 - Scientific Information in the Digital Age: Text and Data Mining). Therefore, the successful proposals in these two calls are expected to engage in a mutual dialogue and establish synergies in their work.
A maximum of EUR 8 million of the total budget for this topic is foreseen for activity (6).  
This topic is complementary with topic INFRADEV-4-2014/2015, as it addresses services that are potentially transversal and generic, whereas INFRADEV-4-2014/2015 addresses interoperability of services and common solutions for cluster of ESFRI and other research infrastructure initiatives in thematic areas.
Expected impact: 
         Increased availability of scientific data for scientific communities independently of them having already embraced or not e-science; this will be measured by cross-border data traffic over the research networks in Europe as a proxy.
         Better optimisation of the use of IT equipment for research.
         Avoiding lock-in to particular hardware or software platforms in the development of science.
         Scientific communities embrace storage and computing infrastructures as state-of-the-art services become available and the learning curve for their use becomes less steep; this will be measured by the storage capacity available for pan-European use as well as by the number of users of EGI and other production e-infrastructures in this area.
         Through the development of large pooled and interoperable text mining infrastructures, efficiencies of scale will reduce the overall costs, and more open licensing schemes will spread the use of such licenses and boost the exchange of text mining resources and practices.
Type of action: Research and innovation actions  
[1]     Research data include large datasets collected, developed or generated for/by research, integration of small distributed datasets, as well as data not originally collected for research, which may include environmental, social and humanities data.

Specific challenge: The public sector has an exemplary role to play (in particular as regards the management of public assets) in addressing the market deficiencies[1] by setting a stable regulatory environment and by engaging in dialogue with the key stakeholders to improve the legal and financial framework and to put in place innovative financing schemes. However, the deployed public funds have to be matched and multiplied by private sector capital, to address the financing gap.
The energy services industry together with the financial sector also need to develop and roll out new business models in order to better monetise future energy savings and tackle new sectors with the aim of reaching a potential turnover of some EUR 25 billion per year[2].
Scope:
Proposals focusing on the roll-out of business models for innovative energy efficiency services (e.g. energy performance contracting), enabling to fully monetise the resulting energy savings.
Proposals replicating successful innovative financing solutions already implemented across the EU as well as successful innovative energy services. Particular attention should be given to innovative solutions enabling aggregation, securitisation, project bundling, risk sharing, structuring of clearing houses, or developing new investment mechanisms (e.g. crowd-funding for sustainable energy).
Proposals implementing large-scale capacity building for public authorities and SMEs to set-up or use innovative financing schemes for sustainable energy.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 1 and 1.5 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected impacts: Every million Euro of EU support invested into the relevant activitiesis leading primary energy savings of at least 25 GWh/year. All proposals should demonstrate a significant impact in terms of larger investments made by stakeholders in sustainable energy; primary energy savings and/or generated renewable energy; better implementation of energy-efficiency policies; number of policy makers influenced; number of people with increased skills; and/or number of people changing their behaviour.

","04 October 2016
","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Europe is faced with numerous challenges that are increasingly global in nature and that have become of more immediate importance: peace and stability, migration, climate change, resource efficiency, health pandemics, etc. In many cases, responding to these challenges requires science-based evidence to inform decisions and joint international efforts that often include also scientific and technological cooperation. This is where science and diplomacy can join forces to form a 'soft power' tool in external policy – science diplomacy.
A main challenge is how to best link scientific expertise and cooperation with diplomacy and political influence to tackle major global challenges, promote knowledge and improve international relations. Science diplomacy has a particular added value in providing additional communication channels, particularly in stalemate situations and relations where few other mechanisms are feasible as well as on sensitive bilateral and multilateral issues. It promotes cooperation and conflict prevention, rebuilds trust and fosters shared understanding across countries, regions and cultures.
At the same time, the global context is characterised by competing understandings of central values and organising principles of society, including the meaning and direction of politics, economics, culture and ultimately human life. This context, and Europe's place in it, needs to be better understood and accounted for, from both a contemporary and a historical perspective, if the European Union and its Member States want to continue to constructively take part and strengthen their position in global discourses about what constitutes a ""good society"" and to understand how European policy interventions have been understood and perceived globally.
Addressing this challenge requires a great dose of (self) reflexivity about European diplomacy, Europe's own history and its interactions with third countries, regions, cultures and religions. It calls for a continued investment in fostering scientific, political, economic, social and cultural relations with other non-European global actors on all continents, and for ways in which to sustain scientific and intercultural exchanges that effectively enhance mutual understanding despite differences.
Scope:
The research to address this challenge should in particular focus on the following key dimensions. It is expected to either comprehensively address one of these dimensions or to combine two or three of them. The research may also cover other issues relevant for addressing the specific challenge.
1) Using science in the context of European diplomacy
In an increasingly complex global context, diplomacy as a social practice and profession is undergoing considerable changes. In both bi- and multilateral contexts, it is no longer sufficient for diplomats to be skilled in the art of negotiation, but they also need to have the capacity - alongside specialist knowledge – to take better advantage of science and scientific cooperation.
How to better prepare and employ 'science diplomats' remains a particularly unexplored research area. The research efforts should focus on examining the interface between scientific advice and expertise and diplomats' performance and capacity. It should analyse where science diplomacy can have the biggest impact and how it can be instrumental in strengthening EU capacities and strategic awareness and in establishing better mechanisms so as to anticipate events early and to swiftly identify common responses. This should involve 'practitioners' of science diplomacy.
Research should explore under which conditions science and scientific cooperation have contributed positively or negatively to reaching foreign policy objectives (peace, security, trade, development, humanitarian aid) in various challenging contexts and draw recommendations for the development of new actions at EU and Member States levels.
2) European culture, values and reflections of Europe's colonial past in contemporary European societies
European values are to a large extent determinants of behaviour. As values stay behind many societal patterns and organising principles of society, the knowledge of the past development of European values as well as the knowledge of their contemporary status could help to understand many aspects of behaviour of contemporary European populations.
Multidisciplinary research associating scholars from the humanities and social sciences should adopt an outside-in perspective on contemporary European societies and trace the manifold non-European and European colonial era-related determinants of present-day societal and cultural diversity in Europe. In so doing, it should pay particular attention to the way societal and cultural influences from outside of Europe have historically been framed, contested, transformed, refused or taken up in European societies. It should elucidate how and why some of these influences were able to strongly impact European societies, values, activities and culture, and why others were less successful.
Research under this topic will lead to a sound understanding of the social, cultural, linguistic and political legacies of colonialism within Europe and globally. It will assess their implications for policy-making, EU values and intercultural and interlinguistic dialogue, including the construction of plural cultural identities in nations and countries of Europe.
3) Global trends of secularisation and religious radicalisation and the role of Europe
Over the centuries the relations between the state and religion were of key importance for the functioning of state and society. Today's world is divided between secular states where government is officially separated from religion and states where this distinction is blurred, in addition to a few theocratic states. Whereas secular states are spread all over the world, and the religions professed and practiced by their citizens represent the widest possible spectrum of beliefs, the majority of countries which have embraced religion as their central norm are predominantly, although not exclusively, following Islam and are located in Africa, the Middle East, the Mediterranean region and Asia. A wide array of differences between official norms and practices still exist and should be taken into account in order to avoid undue generalisations between such countries and states.
Taking account of the diversity of forms of secularism and religion, and adopting a historical perspective, this multidisciplinary social sciences and humanities research should investigate and compare various types and experiences of the functioning of secular and religion-based states in and outside Europe. Its findings should clarify reasons for, and pathways of, transformation of the role of religion in state governance, and should explain differing perspectives of cultural and political co-existence within the polity. Specific attention should be paid to the analysis of the impact of religious radicalisation all over the world and its consequences on states' peaceful coexistence as well as of the foreign fighter phenomenon. Research should also focus on what these trends mean in terms of internal and foreign policies for the European Union, its Member States and the state-religion relationships on the European continent. In this perspective, it could also include the possible forms of injustice, inequality and exclusion that may contribute to societal tension and marginalisation of certain minority groups, as well as the common elements between religion-based values system and secular systems that could help to counter radicalisation.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU in the order of EUR 2.5 million for each dimension would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. This does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
Research under this topic is expected to impact the foreign policies of the EU and its member states and provide enhanced coordination between them and between the EU and its international partners. It will provide in-depth insights into the multiple ties and mutual influences between Europe and its neighbours, former colonies and other countries and regions, especially in the scientific, socioeconomic, historical cultural and religious spheres. It will also provide a sound understanding of contemporary European societies, of the multiple sources and expressions of diversity in the EU and of how non-European influences impact on the formation of European identities. Acknowledging the multiple sources of today's European diversity will have strong policy implications, not just for scientific and cultural policy, but also for immigration, integration, education and external policies. It will also facilitate Europe's future engagement with third countries.

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
One of the major challenges defined in the European Innovation Agenda and which also has to be addressed within the framework of Horizon 2020, is the competitiveness of Union Member States on the global market. One of the sectors where the problem is particularly urgent is manufacturing.
Manufacturing in European countries is under considerable strain: increased competition from other developed economies, low cost production in developing countries, and scarcity of raw materials are putting pressure on the European manufacturing companies. Parallel to this, there are further factors driving change in the manufacturing sector: new market and societal needs, rapid advances in science and technology, environmental and sustainability requirements.
One possible answer to address these challenges is the development of a ""high value (or added-value) manufacturing"" industry. This concept defines an integrated system including the whole cycle of production, distribution and end-of life treatment of goods and products/services applying a customer/user driven innovation system. Rather than competing primarily on cost, added value manufacturers deliver value by delivering product/service innovation, establishing process excellence, achieving high brand recognition and/or contributing to a sustainable society.
The manufacturing sector is of considerable economic, social and environmental significance. In 2010 the manufacturing sector accounted for 15,4 % of the Union's GDP and over 33 million jobs. This figure increases to 37 % if power generation, construction, and associated business services are included. At the same time, manufacturing also contributed to about 25 % of the waste, 23 % of greenhouse gases and 26 % of NOx generated in Europe.
Bearing this in mind, it is quite clear that the overall objectives in the field of manufacturing must be increased competitiveness of Europe within the global market as well as the development of more sustainable and environment friendly manufacturing processes.
Expected Impact:
RELEVANCE AND IMPACT
A KIC on added-value manufacturing will help meeting Horizon 2020 priorities in terms of advanced manufacturing and processing, and its specific objective of ""transforming today's industrial forms of production towards more knowledge intensive, sustainable, low-emission, trans-sectoral manufacturing and processing technologies, to realise innovative products, processes and services"".
It will be able to mobilise investment and long-term commitment from the business sector, and to expand and create new markets. It could have in particular a function in supporting the actions defined in the Strategic Research Agenda of the European Technology Platform (ETP) ""Manufuture"":
Eco-design;
Development of added-value products and services;
Development of new business models;
Development of advanced manufacturing engineering processes;
New emerging manufacturing sciences and technologies;
Transformation of existing research and education infrastructures to support world-class manufacturing.
Whilst supporting the development of new products, services, business models and manufacturing processes, emphasis should be put on sustainability and eco-innovation, with the reduction of resource and energy inefficiencies, maximising positive environmental impacts, but also contributing to strengthening positive economic and social impacts. Concretely, such clean approach will imply energy and material efficient processes and machinery, the use of renewable power sources, and/or the employment of smart energy management, leading thus to significant reductions of waste and emissions. By contributing to the development and deployment of more sustainable, resource-efficient and competitive manufacturing, a KIC would be able to trigger industry and consumers behavioural change and to create systemic impact.
A KIC on added-value manufacturing could also have a very important role and impact at regional level: Fostering the creation of interconnected regional clusters with local transfers and collaboration, developing competences in high-end manufacturing technologies, and developing excellence in manufacturing technologies would be the key missions of a KIC at regional level. In this connection, specific attention could be given to those regions more affected by declining manufacturing capacity as well as to SMEs.
One of the major challenges for reaching the above aims is the availability of a highly qualified workforce which is sufficient in quality as well as in numbers. A KIC would therefore have a very important role to play in re-shaping the education landscape in this field. By creating closer links between skills demanders and education providers, a KIC would promote joint post-graduate degrees, post-graduate professional training and industrial ""real-life"" courses.
Capacity-building will be also a central element of a KIC in added-value manufacturing. This concerns not only the supply of high qualified work force, but also the possibility of establishing the KIC as a forum for interaction and promotion of cross-disciplinary skills and competences, particularly for the combination of multiple key enabling technologies as proposed by the High-Level Group on Key Enabling Technologies (KETs)1 .
A KIC on this area will have the potential to bring together different actors and stakeholders in this very transdisciplinary sector, including key upstream and downstream parts of the value chain. This includes processing industries (e.g. steel or chemicals) which are immediately linked with the value chain for added-value manufacturing.

SYNERGIES AND COMPLEMENTARITIES WITH EXISTING INITIATIVES
A KIC as described above would be complementary to a number of other Union initiatives, as well as at the level of Member States and industry associations.
In addition to the already mentioned ETP ""Manufuture"", it could also establish links with the ETPs on Smart Systems Integration and the Joint Technology Initiative (JTI) on Embedded Computing Systems. The Public Private Partnership (PPP) on Factories of the Future and others potentially to be launched under Horizon 2020 within this thematic area as well as a number of Framework Programmes (FP) projects would also be natural co-operation partners. The KIC would take into account the research priorities and action plans defined in the framework of the ETPs and the research work carried out so far by the JTI, PPP and FP projects in this area.
Similarly, it would build on eco-innovation market replication projects, under the Competitiveness and Innovation Programme (CIP), where experience in the area of more sustainable manufacturing has been developed. Such experience will continue with Horizon 2020 namely in the context of the Climate action, environment, resource efficiency and raw materials societal challenges. Synergies may also be considered with the Environmental Technologies Verification (ETV) pilot programme, which aims at promoting high value environmental technologies by providing a third-party validation of their performance.
An added-value manufacturing KIC could be also a connection point for synergy effects with the European Technology Research Council, which the High-Level Group on Key Enabling Technologies recommends for promoting excellence in technological research and innovation.
A KIC in this area would be complementary to these activities since it would focus on transdisciplinary activities within the knowledge triangle with a strong focus on entrepreneurial education.
CONCLUSION
A KIC which focuses on the integration of all stakeholders concerned with manufacturing and which puts a strong focus on re-shaping the education agenda in this field would be well-suited to address the challenges outlined above.
It also meets the criteria put forward for the selection of KIC themes in the SIA:
It addresses a major economic and societal relevant challenge Europe is facing (to increase the competitiveness of the Member States on the global market and contribute to the development of a more sustainable and environmentally-friendly manufacturing process), and contributes to the delivery of the Europe 2020 agenda of smart and sustainable growth.
This KIC focus is aligned with the priorities defined in Horizon 2020 and complementary with other Union activities in the area.
It can build on a solid industrial sector which will be attracted by a KIC.
It offers possibilities for various emerging products, services and business models, and – above all – it will be well-suited to address the urgent need for qualified people in this sector.
It takes a systemic approach and thus requires transdisciplinary work and the development of new education across the boundaries of disciplines.
It will bring together a critical mass of excellent research, innovation, education and training stakeholders along the value chain, which would otherwise not unite.
It will address the European paradox, since it will capitalise on the Union's strong research base and find new innovative approaches to ensure a more competitive, sustainable and resource-efficient manufacturing sector."

","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
The theme of smart, green and integrated transport has been identified as one of the major societal challenges which will be addressed within the framework of Horizon 2020. The 2011 Transport White Paper further reinforces the importance of taking action in this domain during the next decade. Urban mobility is a particularly challenging task. It addresses a number of topics such as transport (including new mobility concepts, transport organisation, logistics,transport systems safety and security), environmental issues (reduction of greenhouse gases, air pollution and noise), urban planning (new concepts for bringing work and living closer together), and has an important impact both at the economic and social levels (new business creation, employment, social inclusion, housing and location strategies). The overarching aim is to improve the quality of life of European citizens who – in increasing numbers – live in large urban conglomerations where much of Europe's economic performance is generated1.
Sustainable urban mobility can only be achieved if breakthrough innovations leading to greener, more inclusive, safer and smarter solutions are found. Failing to achieve this will – in the long run - result in high societal, ecological, and economic costs. However, new innovative mobility concepts – in particular when individual means of transportation are to be replaced by public and collective means of transport – should be accepted by citizens. Bringing about behavioural changes with no disadvantages for the quality of life and the cost of living in urban areas will be one of the great challenges to be addressed in this area.
1 More than 70 % of Europeans live in urban areas, which represent more than 25 % of the Union territory. Around 85 % of the Union's GDP is generated in urban areas. Urbanisation is expected to rise in Europe to some 83 % by 2050.
Expected Impact:
RELEVANCE AND IMPACT
The key objective of a KIC on urban mobility will be to ensure a greener, more inclusive, safer and smarter urban mobility system.
As already outlined above, the theme is highly relevant from a societal and public policy point of view. It also is highly relevant from a socio-economic perspective since it involves important economic sectors in GDP and employment terms, such as the automotive or the construction sectors. Urban mobility is, in addition, linked with environmental protection strategies and fully embedded in policies of social inclusion, location, housing and urban design.
A KIC on urban mobility is both in line with the priorities defined in Horizon 2020 and with Europe 2020 strategy objectives of achieving a smarter, more sustainable, low carbon and inclusive urban development. A KIC in this thematic area could contribute to each of Europe 2020 strategy objectives by, for example, the promotion of ecoefficient solutions, intelligent ICT schemes for traffic management, and provision of more efficient and affordable transport services.
In fact, since urban mobility is by nature systemic, a KIC on this area could offer many possibilities for innovation along the innovation chain, such as the development of multi-modal transport systems, and smarter and more sustainable transport solutions.
A KIC on urban mobility draws on a solid technological and industrial base and offers a potential for new products and services2, in particular in the fields of sustainable planning and eco-industries.
Furthermore, the development of innovative urban mobility models will also benefit from the strong policy attention and support that this thematic priority profits from. In addition, these innovative urban models can have a global impact if they are transferred as best practices to the massively growing urban conglomerations in other parts of the world, especially in Africa, Asia and Latin America.
A KIC in this area will put urban mobility and urban transport planning in the wider context of sustainable urban planning and spatial development at local and regional level. The KIC would thus have the advantage of working in a multi-disciplinary and cross-sectoral field and of contributing to overcome the current levels of organisational fragmentation the sector faces. It would create the opportunity to establish a closer cooperation between public authorities (mainly at local, regional levels), local associations, and the private sector (such as developers and infrastructure actors), research institutes and universities (integrating the knowledge triangle).
Bringing together world-class partners in new configurations will give the KIC on urban mobility the possibility of optimising existing resources and exploit the business opportunities created through these new value-chains.
The KIC on Urban Mobility will focus on those activities of the innovation triangle which can benefit from additional Union support specifically via the EIT. In reality, the major added value of a KIC in this area will be its role in integrating the three strands of the knowledge triangle and in bringing systemic change in the way the innovation players work together. Likewise, KIC focus on people-driven innovation, which puts students, researchers and entrepreneurs at the heart of KIC efforts, will be fundamental to address the challenges outlined above. Consequently, there will be a strong emphasis on education/training, entrepreneurship and deployment of results, e.g. developing skills and knowledge of urban transport professionals in local and regional administrations (life-long learning / staff exchange programmes / professional training), proposing specific higher education programmes in Urban Mobility (summer schools / exchange schemes), taking innovative transport concepts successfully to the market (support for spin-offs and start-ups from universities and research institutions, etc.).
Moreover, the concept of co-location could be strengthened within a KIC focussing on this theme, since naturally this thematic area has a strong local and regional dimension.

Links with other Union activities exist and will be enhanced. A KIC on urban mobility will take into account the actions developed in the framework of the Action Plan on Urban Mobility and the Intelligent Transport System Action Plan.
It will, in particular, co-operate with the planned European initiatives on smart cities and communities, encompassing energy efficiency, ICT and urban transport.
A KIC would, in particular, create complementarity in educating key actors, but also in providing a structured network of practitioners well placed to identify framework conditions and best practise on policy and regulatory issues having an impact on the sector.
Coordination is also needed with the Joint Programming Initiative ""Urban Europe"", which will pool national research efforts to transform urban areas to centres of innovation and technology, realise eco-friendly and intelligent intrainterurban transport logistic systems, reduce the ecological footprint and enhance climate neutrality. A KIC in this area will speed up and foster the exploitation of excellent public research pooled together by these JPIs, and thereby address fragmentation in the innovation landscape.
The CIVITAS initiative which supports demonstration and research projects to implement innovative measures in clean urban transport, and the European Industrial Initiative on Smart Cities & Communities aiming at making the production and use of energy in cities more sustainable and efficient will also be natural cooperation initiatives of a KIC on urban mobility.
A KIC in this area could also establish links with the transport and energy related European Technology Platforms (ETPs), the Public Private Partnership (PPP) on European Green Cars, and the numerous Framework Programme (FP) projects in this area. The KIC would take into account the research priorities and action plans defined in the framework of the ETPs and the research work carried out so far by the PPP and FP projects to enhance and accelerate the take up and exploitation of these research outcomes.
Complementarities will be also sought with the ""European Mobile and Mobility Industries Alliance"". Co-funded under the Competitiveness and Innovation Programme, the European Mobile and Mobility Industries Alliance aims at bringing together regional and national policy makers supporting innovative service solutions in mobile and mobility industries in view to mobilise more and better support to innovative service SMEs in such industries.
It will also build on the Intelligent Energy Europe, the eco-innovation market replication, and the ICT based services and pilot projects for smart urban mobility under the Competitiveness and Innovation Programme (CIP).
A KIC in this area would be complementary to these activities since it would focus on transdisciplinary activities within the knowledge triangle with a strong focus on innovative products and services and entrepreneurial education.
A KIC focusing on urban mobility would also be complementary to some of the specific activities already pursued by two existing KICs. Namely, Climate KIC activities under the theme transitioning to low-carbon resilient cities, and EIT ICT Labs work under the focus areas of intelligent transportation systems and digital cities of the future. The KIC on urban mobility will take on board the work carried in the framework of these KICs and place it in the wider context of a greener, more inclusive, safer and smarter urban mobility system.
CONCLUSION
A KIC focusing on urban mobility is most suited to address the challenges outlined above. It also meets the criteria put forward for the selection of KIC themes:
It addresses a major economic and societal relevant challenge (to achieve a European transport system that is resource-efficient, environmentally-friendly, safe and seamless for the benefit of the citizens, the economy and the society), and contributes to the delivery of the Europe 2020 agenda and its objectives on climate and energy, employment, innovation and education.
This KIC focus is aligned with priorities defined in Horizon 2020 and complementary with other Union activities in the transport, environmental and energy areas.
By strengthening entrepreneurial thinking it integrates emerging technologies with new value chains and supports the translation of academic research on into products and services.
It will thus address the European paradox, since it will capitilise Union's strong research base and find new innovative approaches to ensure a greener, more inclusive, safer and smarter urban mobility system.
It will blend a critical mass of excellent research, innovation, education and training stakeholders, which would otherwise not unite.
It adopts a cross-sectoral approach and therefore connects the different levels of responsibility from private entities to public administration – in particular at local level – to the individual citizen.
It requires transdisciplinary work involving different areas of knowledge, and the development of new types of education across the boundaries of disciplines."

","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Europe's strategic and geopolitical environment is evolving rapidly, will always be an area of change, and in a manner that increasingly raises concerns. In recent years, violent conflicts have agitated the planet, many of them located in Europe's immediate neighbouring regions. These developments take place at a time when global geopolitics is undergoing long-term transformations challenging the traditional predominance of the West, while policies of economic austerity oblige EU Member States to manage scarce resources more effectively. These trends seriously challenge the Union's capacity for guaranteeing its citizens' security - one of its principal raisons d'être - while also jeopardizing its aspiration of promoting European values and interests abroad. In order to evaluate and promote its preparedness for playing its role as an effective security provider, to prevent escalation, to manage and understand risks and mitigation strategies for peace beyond its borders, the EU needs to understand the implications of recent global developments and assess them against its own capacities and willingness to make synergetic use of them.
Scope:
The research to address this challenge should focus on one or two dimensions that have to be comprehensively addressed. The research may also cover other issues relevant for addressing the specific challenge.
1) Recent global geopolitical developments and their implications for the European Union
Research under this dimension should adopt a comprehensive understanding of security and explore uncertainty. Based on this, it should identify and investigate long-standing and novel - global and regional - external risks facing the EU and its Member States, in connection with ongoing initiatives and programmes for risk identification and early warning. Crises in its neighbourhood (in particular East Europe and the southern Mediterranean), such as the rise of radical Islamic groups exemplified by the expansion of the ""Islamic State"" in Syria and Iraq, but also conflicts and risks in other regions of the world such as in South Asia (e.g. Afghanistan) and Sub-Saharan Africa (e.g. Mali) should be examined. Research should identify the most pressing risks and areas of uncertainty and unravel the causes, expressions and security-relevant consequences of such instable contexts.
It should examine possible inter-linkages between various geographically limited conflict situations as well as their embeddedness into regional and overarching global geopolitical developments. This necessitates a sound understanding of the political, socioeconomic, cultural and military contexts in which patterns of insecurity and uncertainty emerge, also from a historical and philosophical perspective. An inventory of contemporary risks should form the basis for identifying their implications for Europe and its security needs. Research should examine how potential risks, mitigation strategies and opportunities are perceived, and how they can, do and even should become part of novel approaches and policies in the EU, its Member States and its partners in geostrategic matters. It should investigate how the EU, its Member States and other relevant partners can act to better anticipate, prevent and respond to the identified risks, mitigation strategies and opportunities, and develop scenarios on possible EU activities using a range of policy actions and instruments, including diplomatic, economic, civilian and, if needed, military means.
2) European Union's preparedness for managing risks and opportunities, fostering peace in a crisis-ridden context
Research under this dimension should comprehensively examine the European Union's and its Member States' willingness, capacities, instruments and channels for anticipating and responding to a large array of external threats. It should contrast the EU's legal basis for external security policies, including risk analysis and management, conflict prevention and resolution, post-conflict management and peace-building, to the actual practice, both prior to and after the onset of the economic and financial crises. Analyses should draw on comparative case studies from the EU's handling of various conflicts and crises (including humanitarian ones) across the globe. Research should develop criteria for effective security cooperation in the EU, distinguishing between objectives and instruments, whether military or non-military, and contribute to the ongoing development of early-warning systems to identify emerging risks. It should also identify the political, socio-economic, technological and cultural conditions that enable or hinder the emergence of effective security cooperation in the EU. Based on this evidence, research should develop information sharing and decision support systems that facilitate cooperation, identify gaps and align the interests of diverse actors towards effective EU security policies, especially in the framework of its Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP). It should also provide insights on whether and how the EU can work synergistically together with individual third countries or international institutions like NATO.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU in the order of EUR 5 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. This does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
Research under this topic will lead to an up-to-date appraisal of global and regional risks and, as such, of Europe's evolving security agenda in the light of recent geopolitical developments affecting its neighbouring regions (in particular East Europe and the southern Mediterranean), and the entire globe. It will generate critical and forward-looking evidence of Europe's preparedness for effectively facing these threats, guaranteeing its citizens' security while managing risks and fostering peace abroad. Based on this evidence, it will provide recommendations on how to improve the EU's effectiveness as a domestic and global security provider.

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Migration is a central and common phenomenon in human history. The international migrant population in Europe[1] is expected to increase in the future, due to economic and demographic factors, political unrest, conflicts and climate change. One aspect that has become increasingly clear in recent years is that, if the EU wants to successfully manage immigration flows at home, it needs to strengthen its cooperation with third countries of origin and transit of migrants, by fully addressing the root causes of migration and exploiting the potential of migration as a development enabler. In this vein, the European Council conclusions of June 2014 stress that migration policies need to become a stronger integral part of the Union's external and development policies through intensifying cooperation with third countries, while also calling for improving the link between the EU's internal and external policies. Particular account should be taken of the European Agenda on Migration[2], the European Council Conclusions of 23 April 2015 and 25/26 June 2015, and the proposal to establish a new Partnership Framework with third countries[3].
The migration crisis in the Mediterranean has put the spotlight on immediate needs. But it has also revealed much about the structural limitations of EU migration policy and the tools at its disposal. This is an opportunity for the EU to face up to the need to strike the right balance in its migration policy and send a clear message to citizens that migration can be better managed collectively by all EU actors. In recent years, important steps have been taken in this direction but their success, in areas like asylum/international protection, treatment of refugees, visas, control of borders or detention regimes, remains contested. It is thus essential that the EU continues to engage in a broad debate on the links between its migration policies and other policies with an external dimensions including, but not limited to its foreign and development policies. The European policy for asylum, refugees, visas, external border regime, detention centres should be assessed. Research should also make recommendations on how to tackle migrant smuggling and those who profit from it.
Scope:
The research to address this challenge should focus on one or two dimensions that have to be comprehensively addressed. The research may also cover other issues relevant for addressing the specific challenge.
1) An integrated approach to migration and development
Building on existing studies, research should further elucidate the complex interrelation between and the implications of demographic trends, socio-economic development, environment and good governance on the one hand, and migration flows on the other, both in third countries of origin and transit of migrants, refugees and asylum seekers.
Research should cover existing migration management experiences in origin and transit countries focussing on compared practices and policy solutions for effective migration management including the gender dimension. In this perspective, cultural and religious traditions, local knowledge and practices that may affect attitudes to and practices of migration should also be taken into account.
Consortia are encouraged to target geographic areas of current and future strategic relevance for the EU, including those most likely to generate irregular flows. Researchers should be careful to capture the two-way relation between migration determinants and the impact of migration on the broader socio-economic infrastructure and processes of transformation in the sending countries. Given its increasing relevance, climate change and its effects, as well as other or environment-related reasons for migration, could also feature in the analysis of drivers of migration when relevant.
2) EU policy coherence and migration
Research should focus on the interplay between the Global Approach on Migration and Mobility (GAMM) and the deployment of EU foreign policy tools and processes and other European policies with an external dimension, in particular the European development, humanitarian and neighbourhood policies. Research should examine and clarify the links between the existing legislative framework developed by the EU concerning non-EU migration and the increasing use of new types of policy tools to achieve migration management related goals as well as their legal consequences for involved parties. The analysis will encompass the implementation of these policies in selected geographic areas of interest for the EU and the combined effects that such policies have on countries of origin and transit of migrants. Pre-departure policies, programmes and related activities could be the object of specific attention, along with other tools promoting mobility and descent treatment of migrants, in a legal and secure environment. Finally, the effectiveness and coherence of the overall EU approach to third-country cooperation on migration will be assessed, including aspects of inter- and intra-Member States cooperation and coordination, along with areas where further synergies are needed to create greater leverage effects between different EU policies (e.g. trade and labour markets, agriculture and fisheries). In selected cases, consortia should look at the role of bilateral migration policies conducted by Member States vis-à-vis third countries and their complementarity with EU level actions.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU in the order of EUR 5 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. This does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
The results of research under this topic, with its focus on sending and transit countries, should enhance policy coherence on migration between the EU and its member states. Research is thus expected to bring about greater policy coherence and effectiveness in the field of migration management and relations with third countries by clearly identifying and depicting good practices and effective ways to manage incoming and transiting migration at the benefit of local communities and immigrants. It should also allow a better understanding of the root causes of migration, their interplay with other determinants and the two way interaction between migration and development processes. Research will give EU and national policy-makers stronger conceptual tools to better interpret the role of the EU and its Member States as global actors in the field of migration.

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
The European Union's neighbouring regions are, in various ways and for a number of reasons, in turmoil. To the East, the Eastern partnership has been called into question, especially by the long-standing crisis in Ukraine and difficult and uncertain relations with Russia. In the South-East, the EU's relationship with Turkey has increasingly come under strain, while at Turkey's border the conflict in Syria and the ravage of Islamic State armies have created high degrees of instability. In the Western Balkans, the accession processes of several candidate countries remain challenging. Finally, the East and South Mediterranean region has been the theatre of profound and intricate transformations ever since the ""Arab revolutions"" of 2010/11.
Against this backdrop, it is fair to observe that the aim of the European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP) to develop closer relations between the EU and its neighbours, to avoid the emergence of new dividing lines and to strengthen the prosperity, stability and security of all, remains unfulfilled. More than ten years after its inception, the European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP)[1] is under review in 2015[2].
The challenge is therefore to coordinate all available scientific information on these countries in order to better inform the definition and implementation of the new ENP and develop concrete actions for cultural and science diplomacy as an instrument for reinforcing co-ownership and shared understanding with and within the EU Neighbourhood. Considering the protracted conflicts both in the East and in the South, it is expected that science diplomacy can help build bridges across borders and cultures, particularly where other mechanisms are not feasible or less effective.
Scope:
This coordination and support action should provide a stock-taking and critical review of all available research results on the European Union's neighbouring regions, including on science diplomacy related actions[3]. It should synthesise knowledge regarding each of the neighbouring countries and regions, taking full account of the diversities of the studied entities, and compare transformation experiences both from an EU and a third country perspective, across time. In so doing, it should understand the success and failures of diplomatic efforts in the regions. It should also consider relevant results of international cooperation projects involving neighbourhood countries and all relevant existing legal instruments in various policy areas (e.g. energy), take into account the role of other state (e.g. US, Russia, and neighbours of the neighbours) and non-state actors in the various neighbouring regions.
On this basis, this coordination and support action should analyse the role science diplomacy can play and where it could be best deployed in contributing to stability, security and prosperity. It should identify concrete obstacles for science diplomacy in the concerned regions (e.g. the issue of reduced academic mobility due to on-going or frozen conflicts, visa restrictions and security controls, etc. which leads to very limited opportunities for visiting scientists and scholars). It should also provide insights into the role and relevance of the neighbours of the neighbours and non-state actors in the various neighbouring regions as well as to whether science diplomacy should be `silent diplomacy` (low profile) or could be more effective with more visibility. Supplementary research could be envisaged in order to cover the internal-external policies nexus and the role of science diplomacy in tackling some of the most urgent common challenges e.g. conflict prevention and management, job creation and migration, food and energy security, environment and climate change, radicalisation, health pandemics.
Based on lessons learnt, first elements of policy recommendations should be provided.
It should liaise between projects, provide fora for debate and discussion, and disseminate project findings to relevant stakeholders, including policy-makers, social partners and civil society organizations in Europe and third countries. It should draw lessons and provide policy-making recommendations that combine general observations about the Union's neighbourhood strategies and policies with regional and country-specific scenarios. The differences and similarities between the studied regions and their historical ties with Europe and the EU Member States should be duly accounted for.
Wider participation of the targeted region/s is encouraged, including practitioners from the fields of diplomacy, policy making and media.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU in the order of EUR 1.5 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. This does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
This coordination and support action will result in a consolidated corpus of knowledge on science diplomacy in service of the European Neighbourhood Policy as well as research insights in how it could be best deployed in the challenging context of the EU Neighbourhood. It will put together a set of recommendations for EU science diplomacy strategies, policies and concrete actions in these regions and provide an assessment of these activities against criteria that it will develop. Based on these policy-relevant insights, the coordination and support action will feed research insights into the future development of EU science diplomacy in the neighbourhood with an eye to reinforcing stability, promoting democracy and prosperity in its near abroad. It will ensure a wide dissemination of these results to the relevant stakeholders including policy-makers.

Deadline date","Scope:
Specific challenge: Europe's crisis has triggered a renewed European-wide debate on the future of European integration and the political system of the EU. The crisis has revealed structural flaws of European integration adding a political and social dimension to the crisis. Europe's values, the rule of law, considerations for economic, social and territorial cohesion and solidarity, as well as the legitimacy of its institutions have come under strain. Unsurprisingly, the number of protests against European integration increases in periods of a downturn in the economy, and the notion of the European Union's democratic deficit seems to be confirmed. Even more so, trust and confidence in national politics, politicians and political parties, in general, has also fallen considerably across Europe resulting in growing nationalism and populism. The crisis has raised questions about the capacities of political leadership at the EU and national levels to manage the crisis and formulate adequate solutions.
Consequently, although often not new, ideas such as the pooling of more sovereignty in a Political Union, developing a European public space, strengthening the EU parliamentary system and political parties or the use of more flexible integration mechanisms ('differentiated integration'), departing from the 'Community method', including the creation of new institutions, are reconsidered in the light of the crisis. In Member States the crisis has highlighted the limits of the current systems of parliamentary democracy. The reconciliation of finding appropriate solutions to the crisis with re-gaining trust and accountability in democratic practices, institutions and politicians is one of the big challenges for Europe.
Scope: The research to address this challenge should in particular focus on the following key dimensions (proposals do not need to cover all dimensions and may include additional aspects which are relevant to the specific challenge):
1)             The future of European integration - 'More Europe – less Europe?'
Research should include the evaluation of the costs of no further European integration as well as a critical assessment of the effectiveness and legitimacy of European integration. It should also investigate the link between the crisis and EU discourses at national level and the impact of that for defining and pursuing EU politics. The potential vertical and horizontal power shifts and the dynamics (e.g. in terms of competition, coordination) between EU-level and national institutions should be analysed, including an assessment of the appropriate level of and instruments for decision-making. Research should examine the perceptions of European integration by citizens as well as the role of constitutional courts, national parliaments, and other actors. Research should address the pros and cons of various integration modes, including differentiated integration, study how primary-law and secondary-law differentiation have interacted, unveil the effects of differentiation on policy-making and problem-solving, and elaborate the role of differentiated integration in the EU's external dimension.
2)             Challenges to democratic practices and parties in Europe in the context of the crisis
Research should address the extent to which democratic practices are constrained, the impact of economic imbalances across Europe on democracy, new ways of citizens' participation and mobilisation, and the impact of the crisis on national parliaments and party systems, including the extent to which and the reasons why eurosceptical parties benefit from the crisis. The way private actors exercise power on governments should also be investigated. Besides, research should assess the legitimacy of political decision-making and of 'technocratic', non-elected, actors (e.g. ECB, ESM, IMF or other bodies at national level) in crises situations, including the relationship between the growing lack of legitimacy of political decisions, political trust and nationalism. It should look at the options for the democratisation of EU institutions and the relationship between the EU's 'democratic deficit' and the crisis, including the impact of reinforced euroscepticism. Structural obstacles that hinder the development of successful alternatives to democratic stagnation should also be identified as well as actions to overcome those.
3)             Political leadership in times of economic, political and social crisis
Research should analyse how political leaders diagnose problems, prescribe solutions, and mobilize followers. Proposals should take into account the barriers to crisis recognition, the communication of crisis situations, decision-making under uncertainty, and the development of the relationship between leaders and followers. Given the importance of cultural, political, socio-economic, and legal structures globally and within states, research should investigate the role political leaders actually play and how causally significant their contributions in bringing about political outcomes are. There is also a need to analyse the beliefs, values, power relations, and ethical/unethical attitudes and actions of leaders. The analysis should consider the gender dimension, the historical-cultural traditions of leadership, and the historical contexts of different crisis situations.
The research is expected to comprehensively address one, or possibly a combination of, the above-mentioned dimensions. In so doing, proposals may also cover other issues relevant for addressing political challenges in Europe.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 1.5 and 2.5 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected impact:  Research under this Topic is expected to generate in-depth insights into the political, institutional and ideational roots of the crisis and its behavioural effects as well as on the impacts of the crisis on democratic practices, systems, and institutions. It will critically assess the effectiveness and legitimacy of European integration in terms of process, actors, instruments and results as well as in terms of the concepts and theories of European integration and their practical implications. These activities will contribute to a better understanding of the challenges for the future of European integration and the EU's political system and will have a learning effect for future policy-making and crisis management. In exploring different possible solutions and scenarios, research is expected to develop a comprehensive and coherent forward-looking view on how to build an EU political and governance system attractive for the European citizen and how to formulate political strategies and actions for a strong European democracy.

Specific challenge: European cities are very important in policies aiming to create growth, jobs and a sustainable future. More than 70% of the EU’s citizens live in urban areas. Cities are centres of economic development, services, knowledge and creativity. But they are also the places of social polarisation, intercultural confrontations, poverty concentration, unemployment and environmental problems. Within a forward-looking perspective, the challenge is to identify the means and ways to make a European city an emblematic place for attracting jobs and economic activities, transforming it into a ""hub of innovation"" and ensuring social cohesion and cultural dialogue while preserving natural resources and limiting environmental damage for the next generations.
European research and innovation should provide tools and methods for more sustainable, open, innovative and inclusive urban areas; a better understanding of the dynamics of urban societies and social changes and of the nexus of energy, environment, transport and land-use including the interplay with surrounding rural areas; an improved understanding of design and use of public space within cities also in the context of migration to improve social inclusion and development and reduce urban risks and crime; new ways to reduce pressures on natural resources and stimulate sustainable economic growth while improving the quality of life of European urban citizens; a forward-looking vision on the socio-ecological transition towards a new model of urban development reinforcing EU cities as hubs of innovation and centres of job creation.
Scope: Based on concrete urban cases, research and innovation will:
-               Analyse the strengths and weaknesses of urban development as a way to shape the economic, social and environmental needs (cf. work, education, housing, mobility, ICT, energy, logistics, health shopping, access to public spaces, culture and leisure) of citizens and in particular the next generation in a sustainable way;
-               Analyse the impact of social and economic inequalities on sustainable and smart development of cities;
-               Identify in which way European cities can become hubs of peaceful integration of diversity and a place of creativity and innovation;
-               Contribute to the establishment of smart urban ecosystem services, where open data, big data and data access help to create thriving urban areas;
-               Enhance understanding of urban structures, by creating new methods and tools, network approaches to cities and analysis of the economics of urban and peri-urban areas;
-               Evaluate urban areas in terms of current and future ""functionalities"" opportunities, including urban public spaces and the employment of sustainable infrastructure and networks also in the field of cultural heritage preservation and access to all.
The following dimensions could be addressed: Urban Living Labs can be a promising option to design research and innovation projects dealing with the multi-dimensional challenges in urban areas; a strong comparative perspective can enhance mutual learning between cities and urban regions; a multilevel context, taking into account the global, European, national, regional and local contexts and actors, enables the examination of urban issues from different perspectives.
The proposed ERA-NET aims at coordinating the research efforts of the participating Member States, Associated States and Regions in the field described and to implement a joint transnational call for proposals with EU co-funding to fund multinational innovative research initiatives in this domain. Proposers are encouraged to implement other joint activities including additional joint calls without EU co-funding.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of a maximum of EUR 5 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected impact: The proposed research programme on Smart Urban Futures is expected to provide new insights on European urban dynamics, on the localisation of economic and social activities, and the implementation of urban innovations in small, medium and large cities, both in growing as well as shrinking urban areas. It will have an EU comparative and EU forward-looking dimension. Through the use of co-creation of knowledge urban stakeholders will be involved in the complete process from concept to implementation. Emphasis will be put on the scaling-up of urban best-practices.

Deadline date","Scope:
Specific challenge: The impacts of the economic crisis have been far reaching on the ability of the EU economy to innovate, grow and create jobs. In response, the EU has proposed a new growth strategy ‘Europe 2020’ which aims at tackling common European challenges and boosting economic growth and quality employment through smart, sustainable and inclusive growth. However, to ensure conditions for a successful economic recovery we need to better understand the broader contexts of growth in Europe.
Over the last decades different national systemic models, each embodying a different set of economic, social, legal and cultural orders (institutional arrangements) have evolved in Europe. These national systemic models performed very differently in the crisis and their abilities to overcome long-term, structural problems have significant implications for a successful economic recovery.
Increasing global connectivity has accelerated trends towards delocalisation and relocalisation of industry, services and R&D both within Europe and globally. The emergence of new economic actors, driven by low labour costs, but investing more and more in modern technologies, puts further pressure on the European economy and its competitiveness.
European competitiveness can be driven by innovation, but most countries severely hit by the crisis also lack innovation dynamism. However, innovation, growth and employment are interlinked in a complex way. Due to this, on the one hand it is essential to understand better the conditions under which innovation fosters growth that benefits the whole society through high quality jobs and reducing inequalities. On the other hand, a broad range of factors that stimulate innovation need to be explored.
Scope: The research to address this challenge should in particular focus on the following key dimensions (proposals do not need to cover all dimensions and may include additional aspects which are relevant to the specific challenge):
1)             Reform management for economic recovery
The research should provide an explanatory framework in order to describe and assess the politico-socio-economic models (institutional arrangements: political system, administrative system, social welfare system, legal framework, economic system, innovation system) in those EU Member States which have been most severely hit by the crisis and the trajectories of national development that led to it. It should also assess policy responses, in particular concerning the quality of public expenditure and consolidation efforts, taking into account the types of expenditure affected the most and the distribution of the consolidation burden in the society. It should also analyse how the governance systems of these countries allow and enable innovative change in order to explain the reasons for the perseverance of long-term structural problems and to assess the obstacles to institutional reforms. Finally, an assessment of policy proposals on how to overcome the underlying long-term structural problems should be made in the context of benchmarking these countries in terms of socio-economic competitiveness.
2)             Innovation-based growth strategy for Europe
Research should analyse the effectiveness of the innovation-based ‘Europe 2020’ growth strategy regarding employment creation, quality of jobs, inclusiveness and tackling increasing inequalities. The need for supporting policies should be assessed, as innovations both create jobs and destroy jobs, while the net balance depends on many factors such as the type of innovations and their substitution or compensation effects in the economy. The differences across sectors should be explored considering in what way the specific institutional conditions shape this balance, including the effects of public sector investments. Research should also explore policy trade-offs between fostering growth and employment through innovation/technological change and income inequality and how to effectively remedy the potential negative welfare effects. An improvement of the existing, comparative data as well the creation of new high quality comparative data may also be needed.
3)             Global production and innovation networks – costs and benefits for Europe
Research should analyse the costs and benefits of globalisation of production and innovation for the EU, Member States, firms and citizens, including constraints and opportunities for industries (Global Value Chain analysis). It should inspect how strategic decisions for (re)location are made by firms taking into account economic, financial, cultural, social and political aspects, including the new European agenda of Corporate Social Responsibility. The research should also investigate the potential for a better coordinated EU industrial policy, providing different scenarios of European international smart, sustainable and inclusive specialisation, including at Member States' and sectoral level. It should assess the different politically, economically and socially feasible steps of such specialisation(s) including in terms of growth and jobs created, taking into account variations between sectors and geographical areas. In this regard, new modes of and tools for cooperation between Member States should be envisaged.
4)             Migration, prosperity and growth
Research should make a comprehensive analysis of how migrants can contribute to the EU economy and society, including an assessment of the benefits and costs of immigration to the EU, considering both short-term and long term effects. From the labour market perspective, it is important to investigate how migrants can complement native worker productivity and what the success factors and inhibitors in migrants' careers are, including the gender-specific factors. Further analysis of the link between migration and innovation and competitiveness is also needed, in particular of the role of high- and medium-skilled migration in fostering innovation. Comparative analysis of Europe's strengths and weaknesses versus other regions, including their immigration policies, should identify approaches for making Europe more attractive to highly-skilled migrants, while protecting domestic labour, as a potentially important factor of economic dynamism and competitiveness of the EU.
The research is expected to comprehensively address one, or possibly a combination of, the above-mentioned dimensions. In so doing, proposals may also cover other issues relevant for fostering growth in Europe (cf. NORFACE Research Programme on Migration).
Activities aimed at the analysis of the economic impact of the Innovation Union and its commitments are targeted under a dedicated topic 'The economic impact of the Innovation Union' published in the Call on New forms of innovation (H2020-INSO-2014/2015) and are therefore outside the scope of this topic.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 1.5 and 2.5 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected impact: This research is expected to contribute to the scientific base for policies aimed at successful economic recovery in line with the objectives of the ‘Europe 2020’ growth strategy. It will provide insights into establishing durable foundations for growth and employment through more effective forms of governance at national and European level. In particular, it will contribute to a better understanding of the policy instruments designed to tackle the challenges facing the EU in the era of globalisation and will provide new ideas for fostering its international competitiveness. The research is expected to close important knowledge gaps in economic foundations regarding the conditions for and outcomes of innovation-based growth with respect to employment and overcoming inequalities. This new knowledge will help to improve the effectiveness of the European growth and employment strategy both in individual Member States and at the EU level and will contribute to an effective implementation of the Innovation Union.
Activities under this topic will also develop tools for a better assessment of the socio-economic evolution of national economies in general as well as for the analysis of policy options and decision making mechanisms to overcome the current economic and financial crisis.

","11 December 2013
","single-stage
Deadline date","Scope:
Specific Challenge: The crisis has strongly impacted European societies. Many people lost their jobs or part of their income as a result of salary cuts. Uncertainty about the future has risen. European citizens demonstrate an increasing lack of confidence and trust in relation to the governance of financial institutions, companies and the free market overall but also in relation to democratic institutions and politics at European, national or local levels. At the same time, the crisis has pushed the EU to advance the integration process in order to make the European economy more resilient and sustainable.
The fall of trust and confidence caused various antagonisms to (re-)emerge, both between European nations and ethnic groups, as inter alia evidenced by the rise of populist movements and parties. This has highlighted the urgency to find 'Unity in Diversity', posing a challenge, which requires apart from innovative political and governmental responses, a reflective reappraisal of Europe's intellectual foundation. Whilst the EU celebrates its (cultural) diversity as a defining feature, this very diversity is also frequently regarded as an impediment to the formation of a meaningful European identity as well as a European public sphere.
Social protection and inclusion policies are also undergoing continuous reform in the light of financial pressures as well as of governance changes. The distribution of responsibilities between private actors, public actors as well as the third sector is shifting and being reorganised, which may have a significant impact on citizens, arousing further public discontent. The Social Investment Package, adopted by the European Commission on 20 February 2013, provides an integrated strategic framework for social policy reform and the modernisation of social protection systems and services, structured around a social investment approach. This should help individuals, families and society at large to adapt to current and future societal challenges and should help Member States to use their social budgets more effectively and efficiently.
Scope: The research to address this challenge should in particular focus on the following key dimensions (proposals do not need to cover all dimensions and may include additional aspects which are relevant to the specific challenge):
1)             Individual reactions to the crisis and challenges to European solidarity
At the levels of individuals and society, research will explore the links between the meta-social frameworks and the meta-psychic frameworks in modern societies in Europe in the context of the crisis. It should combine theoretical and empirical work in this endeavour, taking explicitly into account the gender dimension as well as spatial justice. Research should also explore solidarity both as an intellectual concept and in its more practical expressions. It will explore the links between the psychological effects of the crisis and perceptions of solidarity and will assess and test the conditions of acts of solidarity by individuals and investigate to what extent the crisis has influenced people’s preparedness to show solidarity with others. Finally, it will provide a critical assessment of what kind of policy responses have in the past undermined European solidarity and will develop a coherent vision of policy responses which are prone to instilling solidarity.
2)             Unity in diversity: prospects of a European identity and public sphere
Research should identify and pioneer ways in which European society can critically reflect upon itself, including its historical, cultural roots, collective memory and social imaginaries. Inquiry into Europe's intellectual base should consider the emergence of a European public sphere which facilitates these reflective discourses at the European level. Research should be transdisciplinary and address whether and how Europe's pluralism and cultural diversity as well as a richness of potentially multiple identities, can be understood as an asset of the European project, which may engender rather than undermine cohesion and serve as a resource for finding ways to ameliorate the crisis at a social level. Research should also investigate the conceptual strength of innovative, genuinely supranational approaches to identity, which are based on values, institutions, legal procedures and discourses. The analysis should draw on existing examples of supranational identities as well as identify the values and social bonds underlying them. Finally, research should consider the emergence of a transnational communicative sphere in Europe and what kind of policy and legal initiatives might facilitate it.
3)             Innovative social investment approaches for the modernisation of social policies and services
The research should identify innovative and strategic approaches to social welfare reform at various levels. It should consider the distribution of the policy, social and managerial roles between public, private and third sectors. Special attention should be paid to the legal framework and the interaction and complementarity of the functions of social welfare policies in the medium to long term. The research should also pay attention to the policy evaluation of social outcomes, social returns and effectiveness of interventions for the various actors, contributors and beneficiaries concerned. Consideration should be given to different types of expenditures, to an optimal distribution of costs and benefits, including those non-financial, and to the most effective means of public investment, including in public administration and public services. Attention should be paid to the gender dimension of social policies as well as generational justices and the challenge to develop sustainable pension schemes. Comparative and multidisciplinary research on social investment at global level could also bring added value.
The research is expected to comprehensively address one, or possibly a combination of, the above-mentioned dimensions. In so doing, proposals may also cover other areas related to the social dimension of the crisis.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 1.5 and 2.5 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact: Research projects under this topic are expected to contribute to enhancing European society's resilience by identifying common ground which may serve as a facilitator for a renewed resolve to foster European integration.
In particular, research is envisaged to expand and deepen the knowledge base on the discontent expressed by individuals in modern societies and on the ways in which their sense of identity is shaped. It should help to point to the cultural shifts that combine social and psychological transformations which would be necessary in order to address the deepest manifestations of crisis in Europe. Research is also expected to support European efforts to enhance a sense of solidarity among citizens. It will also contribute to debates on policy initiatives aimed at strengthening the public sphere to allow for more open and more rigorous debate on European topics within national media.
Multidisciplinary research under this topic is also expected to identify the potential for innovative ways of implementing and financing social welfare systems, including through third and private sector contributions complementing public investments in this area and take into account social rights aspects. The envisaged research is expected to contribute to the effective implementation of the Social Investment Package's priorities in general and to the building of the future knowledge bank on social policies in particular.
Proposals should involve relevant stakeholders with a view to integrating their insights into both the empirical and theoretical inquiry and to establish a dialogue on the issues covered by this topic.

Deadline date","Scope:
Specific challenge: Economic and monetary integration in Europe, underpinned by the creation of the euro, has changed the landscape of international monetary relations with far reaching impacts both for the EU and its external partners. However, the financial and economic crisis has demonstrated that this process is not complete and it still has a number of important shortcomings that undermine the stability of the European financial system and the European economy as a whole.
These deficiencies are related to the ineffective mechanisms of fiscal policy coordination and supervision, and the lack of a coherent regulatory framework for the financial sector, despite its growing impact on the real economy. With mounting public debt, the crisis has also highlighted the importance of sustainable fiscal revenues. Also, despite significant efforts over the years to increase economic convergence in the EU, substantial macroeconomic imbalances remained and were even exacerbated by the crisis. Furthermore, the Blueprint for a deep and genuine EMU underlined the need to progress towards developing some stabilisation tools and a fiscal capacity.
These imbalances, both globally, and within the EU, have also been often mentioned as one of the important factors at the roots of the crisis itself. Due to this, it is crucial for an effective crisis recovery and the long-term sustainability of the European economic and financial system that the economic and monetary integration process is completed, with effective mechanisms put in place to address all of these deficiencies at the same time, in a comprehensive way.
Scope:  The research to address this challenge should in particular focus on the following key dimensions (proposals do not need to cover all dimensions and may include additional aspects which are relevant to the specific challenge):
1)             Effective mechanisms of fiscal policy coordination in the EU
Research should explore the problem of fiscal sustainability in the EU, also in comparison with other major world economies, as well as investigate what degree of fiscal policy coordination at the EU level is needed to ensure long-term sustainability and the effective stabilisation of the economy, notably in case of asymmetric shocks and if the different mechanisms already put in place form a sufficient framework to achieve this. In this context, different potential models of a fiscal union for Europe should be explored and comprehensively assessed, including potential stabilising effects of different forms of shock-absorption mechanisms at the central level as outlined in the Van Rompuy Report, their institutional characteristics, political feasibility and socio-cultural impact as well as the potential to further enhance the economic stabilisation of the European economy[1]. Research should also investigate the practical aspects of fiscal policy coordination, fiscal rules and supervision in the EU, including the role and interplay of different national and European institutions as well as the political and cultural context of enforcing fiscal discipline, in order to identify potential loopholes that still need to be addressed.
2)             Fair and sustainable taxation
Research should make a comparative study of European and non-European taxation systems taking into account factors like, for example, objects of taxation, tax base, tax level, redistributive effects, complexity, control systems and legitimacy. The compatibility of the European tax systems and the broader impacts of the different tax regimes at the European level should be assessed, including the implications for economic development as well as widening socio-economic and gender inequalities. The analysis should also cover the potential of further steps of European tax harmonization including the perspective of true own resources for the EU budget.Due consideration should also be given to ethics, environmental and climatic sustainability, as well as values prevailing across the EU regarding fair taxation.
3)             The impact of macroeconomic and social imbalances on economic stability
Research should analyse the main features of macroeconomic, social and financial imbalances within and between the EU Member States and how they evolved throughout the history of European integration as well as what their implications are, in particular for long-term growth as well as economic and financial stability. A particular attention should be given to the analysis of spill over mechanisms from such imbalances from one Member State to another. It should also be investigated how to more effectively address macroeconomic and social imbalances in the EU and whether the current mechanisms, such as the Macroeconomic Imbalances Procedure and the Excessive Imbalance Procedure, provide an effective and robust framework to deal with this challenge.
4)             The global impacts of the crisis in Europe and the international monetary relations
Research will review the evolution of the global monetary system in the last decades, with particular emphasis on the consequences of the introduction of the euro. It should explore the impacts of the crisis on global power shifts, including the role of different currencies in international trade, capital flows and monetary reserves. The strategies of monetary authorities and their implications at the EU and world level should be analysed with respect to economic activities, including trade, employment, growth and financial flows. Research also needs to investigate the growing global interdependences of the financial and monetary systems and their implications for effective economic policies, including the rising challenges for global governance and international organisations. The activities should also consider different scenarios of the future evolution of international monetary relations and their implications for Europe.
The research is expected to comprehensively address one, or possibly a combination of, the above-mentioned dimensions. In so doing, proposals may also cover other issues relevant for building a more resilient and sustainable economic and monetary union in Europe. Proposals should in particular take stock of the relevant past and existing research projects funded at the EU level.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 1.5 and 2.5 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected impact: Research is expected to advance theoretical and practical debates on a comprehensive framework for a more resilient and sustainable economic and monetary union in Europe. It will provide a critical assessment of the different concepts about effective economic governance in the EU and their practical implications, as well as of the mechanisms already put in place. These activities will contribute to a better understanding of the challenges facing the EU governance system currently and in the future, from the economic, political and technical point of view, taking into account both internal and external challenges. In exploring different possible solutions and scenarios, projects are expected to develop a comprehensive and coherent vision on how to ensure the long-term sustainability and resilience of the European economic system. New concepts, methodologies and tools developed by research will support European decision makers and practitioners in the setting-up and implementation of a reinforced governance architecture in the EU.

","17 January 2017","Specific Challenge:
The successful exploration of new foundations for radically new future technologies requires supporting a large set of early stage, high risk visionary science and technology projects to investigate new ideas. Here agile, risk-friendly and highly interdisciplinary research approaches are needed with collaborations that are open to all sciences and disciplines and that dissolve the traditional boundaries between them. The renewal of ideas is complemented by the renewal of actors taking these new ideas forward. Therefore, this topic encourages the driving role of new high-potential actors in research and innovation, such as excellent young, both female and male, researchers and high-tech SMEs that may become the scientific and industrial leaders of the future.
Scope:
This topic supports the early stages of research to establish a new technological possibility. Proposals are sought for collaborative research with all of the following characteristics ('FET gatekeepers'):
Long-term vision: the research proposed must address a new and radical long-term vision of a science- and technology-enabled future that is far beyond the state of the art and not currently foreseen by technology roadmaps.
Breakthrough scientific and technological target: research must target a scientifically ambitious and technologically concrete breakthrough, argued to be a crucial step towards achieving the long-term vision. The plausibility of the proposed breakthrough(s) to be attained within the life-time of the project must be argued in the proposal.
Novelty: the research proposed for achieving the breakthrough must be based on cutting-edge knowledge, new ideas and concepts, rather than in the mere application or incremental refinement of existing ones.
Foundational: the breakthroughs that are envisaged must be foundational in the sense that, if achieved, they would establish an essential basis for a new kind of technology and its future uses, not currently anticipated.
High-risk: the inherently high risk of the research proposed will be reflected in a flexible but effective methodology for exploring alternative directions and options, supported by open and agile research and innovation practices.
Interdisciplinary: the proposed collaborations are expected to go beyond 'waterfall' configurations in multi-disciplinary science- and technology research. Instead they should seek new solutions through genuine exchanges, mutual learning, cross-fertilisation and synergistic advances among distant disciplines in order to open unexplored areas of investigation and new directions for joint research.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of up to EUR 3 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
Initiating or consolidating a baseline of feasibility for a radically new line of technology and its future uses by establishing the essential proofs-of-principle and their foundational scientific underpinnings.
Strengthening European leadership in the early exploration of visionary, new and emerging technologies, beyond academic excellence and with global recognition. This impact can be reinforced by involving also new high-potential actors such as young, both female and male, researchers and high-tech SMEs that may become the European scientific and technological leaders and innovators of the future.
Impact is also sought in terms of the take up of new research and innovation practices for making leading-edge science and technology research more open, collaborative, creative and closer to society.[1]

Quantum technology (QT) is a rapidly accelerating field of research and development with a strong potential for economic growth. While quantum physics is included in all university curricula as well as school curricula in some European countries, this does not satisfy the needs for quantum awareness, a quantum-ready workforce, and modern quantum education. This topic aims at creating a pan-European agenda for the development of modern quantum technology education serving the necessary key-actors to reach industrial target groups.
Scope:
The action should propose a pilot programme that aims to develop a quality-controlled educational master programme for quantum engineering and industrial applications of pan-European reach. It should be developed and launched in close cooperation with the relevant European industry players in order to provide a programme that addresses concrete industry needs in QT. The action should also facilitate companies to host students of the QT master programme for a period of 3 to 6 months. One outcome should be a network of the training programme pilots based on well-documented best practices, tools and reusable training material, and linked with the industrial target group(s). Another outcome should be a concrete set of lessons learned in launching a pan European educational activity in QT inspired by such pilot programme, including a roadmap and concrete recommendations for achieving it.
The scope of the activities of the pilot programme of the action should include at least five EU Member States or countries associated with Horizon 2020, along with a plan to reach the whole of Europe. The consortium should demonstrate a good mix of excellence in education research and in quantum technologies and engineering, with solid links to the emerging QT industry in Europe. It should have a clear strategy on how to stimulate the cooperation between education stakeholders and the emerging quantum industry in Europe. The action shall further contribute to raising awareness in QT, building on the CSA funded under topic FETFLAG-03-2018.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of up to EUR 300.000 would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
Development of a European quantum education community and of a European education research agenda towards modern, quality- controlled education in quantum technologies and engineering
Establishment of high quality quantum engineering programmes across the union addressing industry needs
First generation of joint MSc students connected to industry and more broadly preparing a skilled young future workforce in quantum technologies and engineering ready to be employed by the European industry

Specific challenge:
There is a need for a deeper understanding of processes that lead to organised crime and terrorist networks. This needs to be examined from a social science, psychological and economic perspective. Where appropriate, research should also take into account the potential impact of organized crime on cohesion of societies.
Research on the human and economic factors in (cyber) crime has not kept pace with research and innovation regarding its technological dimensions. Yet, while the latter may be able to defuse a threat, it does not tackle its causes and remedies. The research needs to address a human and economical point of view in addition to a technological focus. By taking multi-disciplinary approaches, integrating the social, economical and technological sciences a new light is shed on the human factor in (cyber) crime. Proposers of projects seeking to understand cyber-crime should be aware of this emphasis.
Scope:
Research should investigate the role of social, psychological and economic factors in progression of individuals who had unremarkable and ordinary lives into organised crime and terrorist networks. It could also take into consideration the analysis of the institutional environment in which these processes take place, as well as the possibilities of connection between the emergence of these damaging organizations and the problem of trust in social dynamics.
This research may, for instance, examine the role of friendships, kinships, milieus and peer groups of (social) networks and social media. It could cover short- mid- and long term trends pertaining to the impact of organised crime and terrorist networks on societal vulnerabilities. It may also examine the characteristics of individuals that leave them susceptible to these influences and/or social conditions conducive to organised crime. The analysis may also take into account state of the art of theory and research on inclusion and social cohesion and apply economic measures (like e.g. Gini index) but also more qualitative social indicators (e.g. political participation, discrimination on the basis of race, age, class and gender). Research could also look into communication processes within and between networks as well as into processes that lead to terrorist cells.
Proposers could also adopt a further approach by focusing on the impact of social cohesion in the prevention of individuals’ engagement in organized crime and terrorist networks.
Proposers need to develop solutions in compliance with European societal values, including privacy issues and fundamental rights. Societal aspects (e.g. perception of security, possible side effects of technological solutions, societal resilience) have to be taken into account in a comprehensive and thorough manner.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between €3m and €5m would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately (similar to the FP7 Capability Projects described in the general introduction). Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
In line with the EU's strategy for international cooperation in research and innovation[1] international cooperation is encouraged, and in particular with international research partners involved in ongoing discussions and workshops, and US homeland security research entities. Funding for third countries is however still subject to the  evaluations.
Expected Impact:
- Better understanding of the origins and development of organised crime and terrorist networks;
- Better understanding of the process underpinning the progression of individuals from non-violence into violence;
- Enhanced ability to identify individuals at risk of joining or forming organised crime and terrorist networks;
- Enhanced ability to identify organised crime and terrorist networks in an early stage;
- Enhanced ability to prevent the emergence of organised crime and terrorist networks, and respond to the threat of existing organisations;
- Where appropriate to the project, give insights for policy makers at different levels (regional, national, European, international) into ways to improve social cohesion. 
The action is expected to proactively target the needs and requirements of users, such as policy makers at different levels (regional, national, European and international).
The outcome of the proposal is expected to lead to development up to Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 4; please see part G of the General Annexes.

Specific challenge:
Security has been defined as a subjective phenomenon that changes within society. Information on people's understanding of security issues (e. g. crime, terrorism, natural or man-made disasters), their perception of security as well as the relevant facts about the risks and dangers they face, and perceive may vary according to the level of assessment, be it public or personal (individual). Furthermore, people's feelings of insecurity and their perception of the importance of security can be different in diverse demographic groups. Persons who are amongst best protected and most secure in the society are likely to have expectations of security much higher than poorer, less protected persons.
Scope:
The proposal, taking into account past and on-going EU research, should be based on real life examples and address factors affecting the perception of personal (individual) (in)security as well as (in)security perception in spontaneous and more structured groups. Furthermore, this action should aim at collecting and analysing data assessing the elements that influence individual and the group's perception of (in)security. Tools necessary to reduce public and personal perception of insecurity should be examined. Proposers are also encouraged to focus on different demographic groups in order to verify how aspects such as: gender, age, income, occupation, education or kind of a lifestyle, affects the feeling of (in-) security. Furthermore, the anthropological dimension should also be considered.
Expected impact:
The project should aim at:
-          Elaborating a number of priority areas and suggestions for policy makers in order to improve the perception of security within targeted groups.
-          Identification of different factors influencing public (group) and personal (individual) assessment of (in)security. 
-          Improving overall strategic security policy making.
-          Better understanding of how demographic background influences the feeling of (in)security.

The internet has become a central part of modem life. Omnipresent social media, especially media sharing platforms, chat sites, web forums, blogs radically change the way current societies operate. That is why these instruments attract more and more attention from public security planners.
Scope:
This topic shall look at the role and purpose of social media and the relationship between the new social networks and public security. Research to be coordinated by this activity may focus on analysing the following issues:
To what extent are social media likely to influence public security planning?
Shall the adoption of social media across the public security community be treated as a threat or a tool for public security purposes?
Shall the potential of social networking tools be explored by public security agencies for example in order to predict future trends or identify possible threats?
To which extent, in the age of the connected society, are social media used in the eve of urban violence and riots? How can the understanding of the different social media influence on the populations lead to the shaping of new forms of policing in the public space?
What are the ethical and legal implications, for instance with reference to the respect for fundamental rights, of public agencies using social media information for security planning purposes?
Special attention should be paid to ethical privacy and data protection aspects.

Specific challenge:
Community policing is a value system followed by a police department, in which the primary organizational goal is working cooperatively with individual citizens, groups of citizens, and both public and private organizations in order to identify and resolve issues which potentially affect the liveability (quality of life) of specific neighbourhoods, areas, or the city as a whole. Police departments which are 'community-based' acknowledge the fact that the police cannot effectively work alone and must partner with others who share a mutual responsibility for resolving problems. Community policing aims at stressing prevention, early identification, timely intervention, as well as better crime reporting, identification of risks, unreported and undiscovered crime. Individual police inspectors are encouraged to spend considerable time and effort in developing and maintaining personal relationships with citizens and different community organizations.
Scope:
Proposals in this area should focus on indicating best practices for co-operation between police and citizens (communities at different level). Moreover, the proposed actions, taking into account past and on-going EU research as well as EU prevention policies, are expected to analyse ""community policing"" as an opportunity to use a community to observe their environment identify risk and exchange information. This concept based on collaboration and coordinated activities should be analysed as a system aimed at facilitating information sharing and trust building. To this end, the proposed research should also take into account the virtual dimension of “community policing” (i.e. the interaction between citizens and police officers through social networking websites) and analyse its underlying social, cultural, legal and ethical dimensions. The proposal should aim to develop a technology (e.g. application of smart phones) which will facilitate, strengthen and accelerate the communication between two groups by making it possible for community representatives to identify the risk and immediately report it to the police forces.Citizen or community representatives should be actively engaged in the research, to ensure that their perspectives are well embedded in the design of new technology and innovation.
In addition to the above, proposers should focus on trainings for law enforcement agents (for instance by means of serious games or simulations), as well as on awareness raising activities about community policing, for both police and citizens. These activities should also take the gender dimension into account. The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between €2m and €5m would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately (similar to the FP7 Capability Projects described in the general introduction). Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected impact:
Strengthened community policing principles through effective and efficient tools, procedures and approaches.
Early identification, timely intervention, as well as better crime reporting, identification of risks, unreported and undiscovered crime through the community.
Strengthened and accelerated communication between citizens and police forces. Overall, strengthened community feeling and lower feeling of insecurity.
The action is expected to proactively target the needs and requirements of users, such as citizens and national and local law enforcement agencies.

Specific challenge:
 Mass gatherings, especially in urban environments, have a potential risk of escalation and therefore may pose a threat to the safety of humans and the security of the society. LEA representatives as well as people in the crowd and in the neighborhood are regularly injured, sometimes seriously, during  the course of such events. Hitherto approaches of LEAs for de-escalation often lack the capabilities to defuse rising tensions with minimal intrusion techniques.
 Research is needed to identify, test and assess new means of protecting citizens in crowd environments  deteriorating into aggresive scenarios or even riots, such as sound, smell, communication, etc.. These means should be administered locally and with high precision in places where crowd parameters are reaching critical values regarding the safety of citizens. Crowd management tactics that are based on containment and controlled break-up by force could be replaced by festival tactics where one or more disrupting elements are removed with high precision and minimum intrusion before large scale escalation happens.
 This can only be done if crowd management instruments are improved significantly with new sensors and processing capabilities. A strong societal dimension component should be at the core of the legal and ethical rules of operation as a prerequisite to ensure the acceptance of citizens of the instruments.
 Scope:
 The proposals should aim to develop novel technological tools for public order management to help LEAs protect citizens while de-escalating public unrest (especially in cases of influence by alcohol and/or drugs). These tools should be altogether efficient and harmless and could use, for example lights, noise or scents. They should also: enable to focus on a specific group or a single individual inside a crowd;  be difficult to counter; and have minimum to none impact on bystanders.
The proposal should include the largest possible number of LEA representatives in the consortium.
 Expected impact:
 The project should help to protect citizens by developing minimum intrusion and efficient  tools in order to prevent escalation and severe injuries and casualties. The results of the proposals should lead to the elaboration of more effective and less intrusive police actions that significantly reduce the risk of escalation during mass gatherings and increase the level of urban security and its perception among the citizens.

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
To explore and consolidate a new technological direction in order to put it firmly on the map as a viable paradigm for future technology. To foster the interdisciplinary communities that are able to drive this forward, extending from the participating consortia to a wider European pool of expertise. To stimulate the emergence of a European innovation eco-system around a new technological paradigm, well beyond the world of research alone.
Scope:
proposals are sought for cutting-edge high-risk / high-reward research and innovation projects that aim to demonstrate a new technological paradigm within the scope of one of the following sub-topics:
a. Artificial Intelligence for extended social interaction. This sub-topic explores the combination of new Artificial Intelligence and immersive interaction technologies to enhance the social dimension in future virtual social spaces. It aims to lay the basis for a new flavour of social media in which Europe can mark a difference. In 10-15 years from now, Virtual, Augmented and Mixed Reality (eXtended Reality, XR) will be as ubiquitous as Smart Phones are today, leading to new kinds of social media in which, on the one hand, interaction with others will become more natural while, on the other hand, entirely new experiences and ways of sharing become possible. The sub-topic addresses the redefinition of a person’s social interaction space in light of increasing virtualisation, unprecedented social scale information load and ubiquitous intelligence, leading to currently acute issues of trust, the nature of social relationships (beyond ‘friends’ and ‘followers’), believe formation, crowd- and organisation dynamics, the permeation of private and public spheres, or social exclusion and divides, among others. New human-centric and responsible Artificial Intelligence technologies can address these by bringing more social intelligence in the interaction environment and greater user-, contextual- and social awareness, and also through a tighter coupling with sensori/motor- and cognitive processes using, for instance, multimodal XR setups, or minimally invasive interfaces like spatial audio, smart skins, haptics, robotic devices and wearables. Projects will also investigate whether and how the perceptual- and sociocultural parameters implicit in natural, context-rich social interaction carry over to such virtual or hybrid settings. Influence on self-perception, well-being (addiction), acceptance, learning and brain-development/adaptation should also be considered, especially in scenarios of extensive and always-on use. Ethics, age- and gender differences, safety and health should be taken into account.
b. Breakthrough zero-emissions energy storage and conversion technologies for carbon-neutrality. Provisioning clean and sustainable energy is one of the major challenges for Europe to meet its climate ambition. This sub-topic aims at multidisciplinary research (starting from TRL 1-3) for breakthroughs in energy storage and conversion that is clean, compact and ultimately low-cost, aimed at decentralised and/or mobile or portable uses in specific application contexts, for instance, in industry as substitutes to fossil fuels or raw materials for chemistry, in the transport sector (road, air, water and either for motive or auxiliary needs), for portable uses, in sustainable housing, remote places or in emergency situations. Novel concepts and breakthrough techniques with zero emissions of greenhouse gasses and a minimal use of rare or toxic materials have to be explored. Research areas could include storage and conversion of clean energy (e.g., solar, wind, geothermal), solar fuels and solar chemicals, possibly based on recycled and atmospheric CO2 or other. Research on electro-chemical batteries is not addressing this sub-topic. Where relevant, circular design and/or high degree of recyclability must be addressed. Clear and ambitious performance targets and milestones to achieve them shall be provided.
c. Digital twins for the life-sciences. The sub-topic aims at the close integration and real-time interaction of computational models of biological structures and systems (from biochemical pathways to cells, tissues, organs and individuals), with non-destructive analysis, advanced imaging and sensing techniques for such biological systems, mechanisms and processes. It extends concepts and technologies of digital twins beyond their industrial versions, which are typically supporting the life-cycle of engineered products, into the domain of the life sciences. The core challenge is to derive and update the digital twin from longitudinal and individual data, and using information from the cutting-edge non-destructive analysis, imaging, sensing and monitoring of its biological counterpart, using advanced Artificial Intelligence techniques and taking the achievements of systems biology, mechanobiology, metabolomics and systems medicine into account. This can be done in vivo at whole-body (e.g., using wearable and implantable sensors) or organ level; or in vitro (e.g., for interacting cells and organoids, 3D cell co-cultures, organ/body-on-chip). A further challenge is to include dynamics at multiple spatio-temporal scales (e.g. for deriving predictive values or simulating adaptation processes, or by evolving the twin itself into a better model through evolutionary or adaptive AI techniques), through new principles of molecular mapping, imaging, sensing and data analysis or Artificial Intelligence that take the time-dimension into account. Biological dynamics can be observed in the non-manipulated state (normal, diseased) or under manipulation (altered, perturbed, diseased) by chemical, biological or physical interventions such as gene-editing, pharmaceuticals, viruses, acoustic waves, electromagnetic fields, light, forces, or altered temperature. This will offer unprecedented insights into the molecular, cellular and extra-cellular dynamics underlying human disorders such as developmental, metabolic, cardiovascular, neurological, oncological or rare pathologies, where personalised precision medicines and advanced diagnostic and therapeutic approaches but also prevention measures (lifestyle, nutrition, environmental factors) are needed to make healthcare more effective, more convenient, cheaper and uniquely tailored to each patient. Work on ethical implications should be included.
d. Measuring the unmeasurable –– Sub-nanoscale science for Nanometrology. This sub-topic seeks to find and test new approaches for nano- and sub-nano metrology. Proposals should target new techniques, for example, physics-, biochemistry- and chemistry-based methods incorporating nano- and picometre-length scales in the spatial domain with femto- and atto-seconds in the temporal domain. The proposal must address research from a novel measurement concept up to a technique and/or method including prototype measuring devices/setups and procedures, and sound metrological aspects like quantification of uncertainty or traceability. Proposals should seek to approach theoretical limits in challenging domains (physical, chemical, biological) while minimising any potential damage or change to the object being measured. Full three-dimensional characterisation (tomography) or the application of metrological procedures to transient phenomena on a sub-nanosecond time-scale could push the limits in metrology. Research on refining existing techniques is excluded. Proposals will address emerging issues of nano-metrology in spatial and temporal dimensions, including for example morphology, composition, reactivity, energy, dynamics or relevant optical, electronic, chemical and biochemical properties. Challenges in measurement that could be used as test cases are, e.g., understanding and controlling changing morphology impacting chemical properties in nano-photonic devices or battery electrodes; integrating metrology with sub-nanoprinting, nano-engineering or self-characterisation techniques; the measurements of heat transfer across interfaces down to the atomic size level; or the characterisation of the dynamics of molecular interactions in or with biological systems for health or smart materials. The use of advanced modelling, statistical methods, big data and machine learning methods is welcome where appropriate.
Projects should establish a solid baseline of knowledge and skills and assemble the interdisciplinary communities around them, including from the social sciences and humanities. They should further foster the emergence of a broader innovation ecosystem and create a fertile ground for co-design of the new technological paradigm and its future take-up (e.g., wider stakeholder/public engagement, informal education, policy debate), in line with the discussion on Responsible Research and Innovation (RRI) in the introduction of the FET part of the work programme.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of EUR 4 to 4.50 million and with a duration of up to 4 years would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts or project duration.
This topic allows for the provision of financial support to third parties established in an EU member state or country associated with Horizon 2020 in line with the conditions set out in General Annex K, either to enhance impacts through punctual small scale experimentation and use of project results by third parties, or to award a prize following a contest organised by the beneficiaries.
Expected Impact:
Scientific and technological contributions to the foundation and consolidation of a radically new future technology.
Potential for future returns in terms of societal or economic innovation or market creation.
Spreading excellence and building leading innovation capacity across Europe by involvement of key actors that can make a difference in the future, for example excellent young, researchers, ambitious high-tech SMEs or first-time participants to FET under Horizon 2020.[1]
Build-up of a goal oriented interdisciplinary community (within and beyond the consortium).

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
new synergies between the distant disciplines of environmental modelling, advanced sensor research, social sciences, and Artificial Intelligence can lead to radically new approaches for creating and using dynamic models of the environment, including predictive modelling, scenario testing and real-time tracking. The ultimate goal is to build a systemic understanding of the socio-environmental inter-relationships, for instance to regulate or design policies and incentives for environmental sustainability and to track their effectiveness over time and to provide intelligible options for adjusting them.
Scope:
Proposals are expected to have their main focus in only one of the following sub-topics:
a. new techniques for modelling and predicting socio/environmental evolution across different temporal and spatial scales. These will combine, analyse and interpret data from in-situ and remote (e.g., satellite) sensing technologies, other public data sources (e.g., historical data, planning documents, legislation), and data or models/theories from human behaviour (including gender differences), economics and the social sciences by making recourse to advanced artificial intelligence techniques, if/as needed. The focus is on modelling and tracking of the interplay between natural and societal systems, for example on how policies and economics modelling predict human behaviours’ impact on the environment, how explicit or implicit incentives and social norms interact with the environment’s evolution and exploitation, how real-time environmental awareness and intelligence can improve behaviour towards more sustainability, or how the decisions based on changes in the environment in turn affect the state of the natural environment.
b. radically novel approaches to resilient, reliable and environmentally responsible in-situ monitoring.In-situ sensing technologies (physical, chemical, biological, behavioural) for environmental monitoring, in particular favouring sensors for parameters and environments that are currently under-sampled but at the same time critical for improving predictive models for understanding environmental processes. Proposals should look for ground-breaking concepts of affordable sensor design and deployment, maintenance, retrieval and/or recycling, based on concepts such as self-deployment, self-awareness, adaptation, artificial evolution, self-repair and controlled decomposition; or using edge computing, distributed Artificial Intelligence or new concepts from micro-robotics to optimise sensing or monitoring frequency. Advanced research on the networking aspects is not addressing this sub-topic.
Projects are to focus on one or a few critical resources (e.g., water, air) and to establish fundamental advances on the most critical challenges that will underpin a step improvement in monitoring, analysis and management of important social/environmental processes for improving quality of life and environmental sustainability (possibly including aspects of waste, noise, …). Citizen involvement, for example for prioritizing resource challenges, data collection, raising awareness towards environmental issues or better understanding of behavioural change in relation to environmental sustainability, is encouraged, in line with the discussion on Responsible Research and Innovation (RRI) in the introduction to this FET work programme. The collected and simulated data should adhere to the FAIR data principle and be compliant with European Standards.
Selected projects under this topic will be expected to collaborate, jointly aiming at delivering a blueprint for a full-fledged system for environmental intelligence.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of up to EUR 4 million and with a duration of up to 4 years would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts or project duration.
Expected Impact:
Enabling new approaches to monitoring, analysis and management of critical resources in Europe;
Availability of reliable data and models at multiple levels of granularity for environmental policy making;
Reduced environmental footprint for environmental ICT;
Increased local and citizen awareness of environmental impacts.

","19 March 2019
","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
to turn promising results from FET-funded projects into genuine technological or societal breakthrough and disruptive innovations. Since the typical researchers' mind-set is to identify further opportunities for research, promising research results that could be the basis for breakthrough and disruptive innovation risk to remain unexploited. The challenge is to create a fertile ground for those results to mature, to a level where exploitation and investment opportunities can start to be discussed, and ultimately towards future market uptake. While recognising that this may still take further research and development, it is crucial to complement research excellence with a focus on entrepreneurial ambition and commitment at an early stage.
Scope:
The EIC Transition Activities pilot aims at bringing promising technologies as they are at the end of a typical FET-Open or FET Proactive project (i.e., TRL 2/3) to a level of development, validation and demonstration where they become a credible basis for entrepreneurship, business creation, investment and, ultimately, economic and/or societal returns. The project shall be driven by a partner with the vision, ambition and commitment to bring the technology to actual use (possibly through the creation of a start-up or spin-off).
Proposals must build on results from an ongoing or finished project (Research and Innovation Action), funded as a result of a FET-Open or FET Proactive call under Horizon 2020[1]. The targeted technology should be in one of the following areas:
Micro- and Nano-technologies
Artificial Intelligence and advanced robotics
Technologies for the life sciences, health and treatment
Low-carbon energy and climate change technologies
Interaction technologies (including virtual- augmented- and mixed reality,…)
The precise link(s) with the relevant FET project(s) is to be explicitly described in the proposal. This topic does not fund research or activities that are/were already foreseen in the original FET project(s).
Participants must have essential capabilities to increase the maturity of the targeted technology. Activities proposed should reflect the level of maturity of the result to be taken up. Proposals can include activities with, for instance, partners for technology transfer, licence-takers, investors and other sources of financing, user/client organisations or potential end-users.
Proposals should specify the intended outcome(s) of the project and describe its key performance indicators/success criteria. Proposals must also include an exploitation plan describing the market or societal potential (potential users/customers and benefits for them; targeted European/global markets, etc.), measures to enhance the probability of take-up and a credible development strategy that identifies next steps, possibly using the services and funding/financing opportunities offered in the context of the EIC Accelerator pilot. Particular attention should be paid to IP protection and ownership and to the possibility of commercial exploitation ('freedom to operate').
The Commission considers that proposals for actions up to 24 months and requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 1.00 and 2.00 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately.
Expected Impact:
Increased value creation from FET projects and contributing to the competitiveness of European industry/economy by developing further promising technologies and innovation opportunities.
Fast development, demonstration and economical/societal take-up of promising FET technologies.
Increased H2020 first time participation of high tech SMEs (including Spin-offs and Start-ups) and industry.
Leveraging more private investment into research and/or innovation.

","Research and Innovation action
","19 March 2019
","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
To explore and consolidate a new technological direction in order to put it firmly on the map as a viable paradigm for future technology. To foster the interdisciplinary communities that are able to drive this forward, extending from the participating consortia to a wider European pool of expertise. To stimulate the emergence of a European innovation eco-system around a new technological paradigm, well beyond the world of research alone.
Scope:
proposals are sought for cutting-edge high-risk / high-reward research and innovation projects that aim to demonstrate a new technological paradigm within the scope of one of the following sub-topics:
a. Human-Centric AI. Artificial intelligence (AI) is gaining more and more footholds in various aspects of our life. However, machine learning algorithms are difficult to understand, opaque and may have implicit biases in their decision making. Explicability has become an essential element if users are to trust, accept and adopt the next generation of intelligent machines on a wider scale. This initiative seeks to advance to the next AI frontier with verifiable, evidence-based features of trustworthiness (i.e., reliable and unbiased alignment of values, goals and beliefs) and transparency (explainable performance), exploring radically new approaches (e.g., inspired from neuro-science, cognition or social science). For instance, explanation could be more tightly intertwined with the decision making process itself so that decisions can be challenged, interpreted, refined and adjusted through mutual exchange, introspection (e.g., self-awareness of biases, reflecting on the internal functioning of the learning system, or on what caused a wrong or unacceptable decision) and active learning of both system and user, for example through dialogue or other forms of multi-modal interaction aimed at establishing mutual trust. New data collection and ownership/governance models that go beyond the dominant off-line and centralised data processing should be investigated, and new avenues, such as for incremental, unsupervised, active, one-shot and ‘small data’ machine learning, should be explored. The projects are expected to contribute to the wider debate on the sociotechnical, organisational and AI-ethical dimensions of such technologies and systems, and link to the ’Commission’s broader AI strategy[1].
b. Implantable autonomous devices and materials. Radically new biomedical technologies that will lead to enhanced life quality for people are urgently needed, particularly for mitigating the impact of chronic health conditions that are placing a rapidly growing and ultimately unsustainable burden on healthcare systems. A key goal will be to demonstrate dramatically extended functional lifetimes of implantable devices, for example, through incorporation of smart sensing, self-awareness, adaptation (form and/or function) and self-repair capabilities. Included are mobile micro/nano devices based on biological models that can perform advanced functions e.g. site specific automigration, ability to distinguish tissue types (diseased, normal) and perform highly localised actions (e.g., delivery of therapeutic agents). Entities incorporating (bio)materials that provide instances of totally autonomous biomimetic behaviour and in-situ integration and adaptation are particularly welcome, such as an ability to blend-in with the native biological environment, to independently generate power, synthesise active agents or sense and respond to changes in the local molecular environment. Work on ethical implications should be included.
c. Breakthrough zero-emissions energy generation for full decarbonization. Clean and sustainable energy is one of the major challenges of our time. This sub-topic aims at the multidisciplinary exploration of new directions (starting from TRL 1-3) for power generation that is clean, compact and low-cost, aimed at stand-alone, mobile or portable uses in specific application contexts, for instance, in the transport sector (road, air, sea and either for motive or auxiliary needs), for portable uses, in remote places or in emergency situations. Breakthrough concepts and techniques for energy generation have to be explored for generating heat and/or electricity efficiently with zero emissions and with a minimal use of rare or toxic materials. Research areas could include, for example, long duration high heat sources from hydrogen-metal systems (e.g., using nickel), energy generation in plasma and cavitation systems. These or any other concepts with similar compact, high energy density and low-cost energy generation capabilities should be harnessed to make them usable for specific application contexts. Clear and ambitious performance targets and milestones to achieve them shall be provided.
FET Proactive projects should establish a solid baseline of knowledge and skills and assemble the interdisciplinary communities around them. They should further foster the emergence of a broader innovation ecosystem and create a fertile ground for future take-up of its new technological paradigm (e.g., public engagement, informal education, policy debate).
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of up to EUR 4 million and with a duration of up to 4 years would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts or duration.
This topic allows for the provision of financial support to third parties established in an EU member state or country associated with Horizon 2020 in line with the conditions set out in General Annex K, either to enhance impacts through punctual small scale experimentation and use of project results by third parties, or to award a prize following a contest organised by the beneficiaries.
Expected Impact:
Scientific and technological contributions to the foundation and consolidation of a radically new future technology.
Potential for future returns in terms of societal or economic innovation or market creation.
Spreading excellence and building leading innovation capacity across Europe by involvement of key actors that can make a difference in the future, for example excellent young, researchers, ambitious high-tech SMEs or first-time participants to FET under Horizon 2020[2].
Build-up of a goal oriented interdisciplinary community (within and beyond the consortium).
Emergence of an innovation ecosystem around a future technology in the theme addressed from outreach to and partnership with high potential actors in research and innovation, and from wider stakeholder/public engagement, with due consideration of aspects such as education, gender differences and long-term societal, ethical and legal implications.

The proposed Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) for the period post-2020 assigns a prominent role to the use of indicators for the preparation of the CAP plans and for the monitoring of the policy. While the decision-making process on the legislative proposals for the Multiannual Financial Framework and related preparatory work are on-going, Research and Innovation Actions should pave the way for longer-term modernisation of monitoring and evaluation.
Scope:
The project will support the long-term development of monitoring and evaluation frameworks for agricultural policy. Insofar as it is possible these frameworks will be based on context, results and impact indicators and reflect the need for modernisation, simplification and accuracy. The project will establish an inventory of indicators, proxies and data needs which would allow for a better targeting of agricultural policy, in social, environmental and economic terms. The consortium will rely on the input of the relevant scientific disciplines and administrations.
The project should explore how the identified data needs can be met. A strong scientific basis, combined with technical knowledge and support from the ICT and other relevant sectors should allow the exploration of advanced and innovative data capturing methods. These methods will: (a) rely on a combination of different sources, for example combining satellite data with on the ground sensors or data captured by drones; (b) where possible be automated and/or rely on platforms, sensors or other systems already in place, while anticipating future needs; (c) respect other economic or social needs such as a good cost-benefit ratio and respect for privacy.
The project will identify the most promising pathways for managing future data flows between the private sector, Member States and the EU (a) aiming at a mutualisation of resources and (b) allowing for a better use of the data and information beyond policy monitoring and evaluation. Needs at farm level should also be covered, for instance enhanced possibilities for e-declarations, one-stop data entries, integration of field and administrative data, or on-the-fly automatic information retrieval from clouds.
The project will take into account existing relevant initiatives and methods and consider what is developed by the following projects: Recap, BEACON, CAPSELLA, SENSAGRI, Sen4Cap, as well as the projects selected under RUR-03-2018: Contracts for effective and lasting delivery of agri-environmental goods, RUR-20-2018: Digital solutions and e-tools to modernise the CAP and DT-ICT-08-2019: Agricultural digital integration platforms.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of up to EUR 2 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
Support the development monitoring and evaluation frameworks of the CAP but also of other EU and national policies (e.g. environmental policies):
in order to achieve a better targeting of policy measures;
establish an inventory of data needs and potential solutions to fill in these needs;
develop a roadmap and explore a potential initiative with Member States on research and innovation in the domain

Urban agriculture[1], in its many different forms, can provide responses to a wide array of challenges related to life in cities. In developed countries, these relate mainly to social and environmental concerns, climate change adaptation, sustainable urban development, food quality and sustainability, or to the search for new economic avenues and business models. In developing countries, urban agriculture has also proved to be a non-negligible source of food and income for the urban poor, and a valuable buffer in cases of food shortage. Consequently, interest in urban farming has significantly increased in the last years. Initiatives, projects, networks and studies have proliferated worldwide. However, these studies generally focus on just one or a few of its dimensions. There is a need to address urban agriculture from a holistic perspective, to develop a comprehensive vision about its future role and to see how European policies, including research and innovation, can support its development.
Scope:
The proposals should build on knowledge and data created through recent studies and former projects and address the exchange of knowledge and experience in urban farming. In line with the principles of Responsible Research and Innovation, the proposals shall bring together actors (academia, municipal and regional authorities, urban farmers, businesses, citizen associations, etc.) representing various approaches to urban agriculture across a representative set of urban locations and countries (including least developed countries). Proposals should consider the variety of contexts and motivations that exist, and encompass all the dimensions of urban agriculture, such as:
Role in urban development and landscapes, and potential synergies and conflicts with other land uses and economic activities, including notably urban sprawl;
Environmental benefits (biodiversity, green infrastructure, climate, etc.);
Social benefits, including income generation, development of social capital within cities, effects on gender balance, or improved urban-rural connections;
New business models based on urban agriculture;
Improvements on food security, accessibility, safety and quality as well as food literacy and diets.
The formulation of guidance and recommendations to stakeholders and policy makers, including on means to engage European citizens in urban agriculture, are included in the scope.
Cooperation with relevant projects in this domain under Horizon 2020[2] (including notably the project funded under FNR-07-2020) or other programmes is essential. Where relevant, the consortium should establish links with actors and networks around the world that are active in this domain.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of up to EUR 2 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts
Expected Impact:
Activities should contribute creating a community of stakeholders, fostering a structured dialogue and developing a holistic and balanced vision of urban agriculture. In the short term, this will help to:
Develop and deploy urban agriculture initiatives by urban stakeholders adapted to a variety of contexts;
Inform the development of policies supporting the development of urban agriculture and facilitate harmonisation and coordination between decision-making levels.
Develop suitable R&I programmes to deliver the knowledge, technologies and practices needed to achieve the objectives set out in the vision.
In the longer term, this should contribute exploiting the full potential of urban agriculture to improve the quality of life, wealth, health, diets and food security and safety of urban dwellers.

Land and soils perform a number of vital functions including the production of food and the provision of ecosystem services such as water purification, nutrient cycling, carbon storage and the support to biodiversity. Pressures on land and soils continue growing as a consequence of competing demands for the delivery of food, energy and biomaterials or the development of industries, infrastructures and urbanisation. Finally, soils are also at the center of climate mitigation efforts.
A new level of ambition is needed to tackle Research and Innovation (R&I), thereby generating the necessary knowledge, solutions to enhance the delivery of soil functions and develop capacities for a more sustainable land management across Europe and beyond.
Scope:
Activities will create an effective framework for action which will allow pooling resources, coordinating efforts and developing a coherent portfolio of R&I activities (programme) in the wider area of soils and land management. This will include
mapping and assessing existing soil/land related European and international R&I activities and promoting their coordination
analysing the needs for R&I on soils/land management as expressed through stakeholder/citizen consultation and on-going research projects
identifying gaps, priority areas and types of action for intervention
proposing methodologies to monitor and review a portfolio of soil related R&I activities
The details of coordination activities will be defined during the grant preparation phase with the Commission.
Proposals fall under the concept of the ""multi-actor approach""[1], thus bring together main players such as from research, research funding, policy and land management and land. Transdisciplinary and integration of SSH and RRI are also encouraged. Activities will be implemented in close cooperation with EU Commission services. The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU up to EUR 1 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
Funded activities will increase European capacities (technical, organisational) for implementing a major R&I programme on soil/land management. This will result in

Animal products constitute an important source of good quality, digestible proteins, minerals and vitamins in human consumption patterns and are part of a healthy and balanced diet. Due to the increasing demand at global level for animal derived food and the mounting pressure over land use, further intensification and expansion of animal production is expected. Development of the livestock sector at EU and global levels is challenging as it contributes significantly to greenhouse gas emissions, can put pressure on the environment and natural resources, may increase the risks to the health and welfare of animals within the systems and to human health. At the same time, livestock farming systems generate valuable products for human consumption including some from resources that cannot otherwise be converted into food (e.g. grass-based systems). They support the development of rural communities, but livestock farmers often thrive to reach economic sustainability. Extensive livestock systems can contribute to the management and maintenance of ecosystems and may increase biodiversity. Climate change is an additional pressure to the sustainability (e.g. productivity, health) of livestock systems. Means to improve sustainability of terrestrial livestock production and consumption systems need to be sought. Farming systems and the agri-food chain need to be (re)designed in a holistic manner to best reconcile the various demands concerning productivity, sustainability, quality and other societal values, for now and the future.
Scope:
Proposals shall address only one of the following sub-topics:
A. (2020) Husbandry for sustainability (RIA)
Proposals should undertake a comprehensive assessment of the sustainability and potential delivery of ecosystem services, social services, resilience, competitiveness and possible trade-offs of diverse EU livestock production systems[1], covering all the EU’s major types of production systems and most important species.
The assessment should be holistic, encompassing the main facets of the concerned systems, and their role in a circular economy. These facets will notably include: environmental impacts (incl. impact of feed production, climate change, (indirect) land use); economics and supply chain dynamics (incl. international trade, demand, market power and farm income); territorial dynamics (incl. socio-geographic and demographic changes of the concerned farming community, areas with little alternatives to livestock production); animal welfare; as well as food and nutrition security (extended to the place of animal products in the society and diets in the future).
Activities will build on existing Life Cycle Assessment data and perform new measurements where necessary. Work on emission factors should be included and the development of new comprehensive models should be supported.
The assessment should form the basis for a coordination of further action in response to the major challenges of the respective production and consumption systems, in the domains of research, innovation, policy-making and business development. A wide range of alternative development scenarios will be used to identify the most appropriate coping strategies and future development scenarios within planetary and nutritional boundaries and may propose policy options. The analyses will include (indirect) effects on related production systems.
Proposals should fall under the concept of 'multi-actor approach'[2], representing a broad and diverse range of public and private interests and actors. This will provide insights on how sustainable livestock management can be translated into practice and propose holistic solutions and policies to tackle the multiple societal requirements related to livestock production.
B. (2020) Husbandry for quality (RIA)
Proposals should undertake an assessment of the intrinsic quality of livestock products stemming from different production systems. They should study the relation between intrinsic quality and husbandry (e.g. breeding, feeding, management), taking into account the processing methods and means to ensure authenticity along the food chain. Where considered appropriate, proposals will dedicate resources to the assessment of claims on the relation between intrinsic quality of products and extrinsic factors (e.g. sustainable production systems, traditional production systems). Proposals may work on one or more species but shall, within the same species, assess at least differences between extensive and intensive production systems. Proposals should fall under the concept of 'multi-actor approach', representing in particular farmers, the food industry and consumers.
The intrinsic qualities covered will at least encompass: (i) food safety (ii) nutritional value, (iii) organoleptic quality and sensorial features of animal products.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of up to EUR 9 million for scope A and EUR 6 million for Scope B would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
Proposals should contribute in achieving the following impacts:
Incorporation of societal demands in livestock production
Increasing the added value of livestock products, via higher quality and/or more sustainable production processes
(Scope A) Development of pathways for action in research, innovation, policy and business development, in support of a sustainable development of the EU livestock sector
(Scope B) Understanding of the relation between intrinsic quality and husbandry

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
To meet increasing societal requirements as well as food insecurity challenges, agriculture must address the environmental and climate change issues relating to primary production. By using ecosystem services, agroecology – defined as the study of ecological processes applied to agricultural production systems – can strengthen the sustainability and resilience of farming and land use systems, including through agricultural practices that contribute to climate change mitigation. Agro-ecological production practices are site-specific, complex and long to setup. They must be implemented on a significant proportion of farms to have a tangible impact on the environment. In addition to the spatial and temporal scales, the human and social factors also need to be taken into consideration to develop a coherent and integrated approach. Speeding-up the agro-ecological transition requires a strengthening of research infrastructures and open innovation initiatives, such as living labs, with the potential to trigger large-scale change. There is a need for mechanisms that can help sustain research infrastructures and approaches that deliver site-specific knowledge and solutions in the long term and at the relevant landscape level. Individual European research projects can contribute to launching facilities or networks but can neither sustain them in the long-run nor integrate them in bottom-up grassroots initiatives in specific territories. A successful transition to agro-ecology, as a climate friendly production system, requires the development of an ambitious and longer-term joint action at European level involving European, national and regional funders.
Scope:
Proposals shall develop the framework for a European network of agro-ecological living labs (LL) and research infrastructures (RI). Such a framework should make it possible to grasp long-term agro-ecological processes at landscape level and would accelerate the transition to sustainable farming practices by promoting place-based innovation in a co-creative environment. Proposals shall map existing European RI, LL and similar research or open innovation activities that contribute to knowledge creation and further deployment in practice of agro-ecological production processes. They should build on the work of past and ongoing RI and LL initiatives, in and outside of the agricultural domain, and analyse how to develop relevant approaches for agro-ecological production systems. Proposals should take into account the results of national and regional projects, networks or LL launched under Horizon 2020 and previous European research and innovation framework programmes and RI related to agro-ecosystems. They should describe in detail the functioning of these initiatives and their existing capacities. They should analyse the potential to create new initiatives as well as the various methods and approaches followed, and identify potential synergies and trade-offs between RI and LL in order to propose a common set of activities to connect them. Proposals should also analyse how various stakeholders (such as farmers, up- and down-stream businesses, consumers and citizens) are engaged in these initiatives and make recommendations regarding their engagement in future initiatives. Knowledge and data management issues will be taken into consideration in particular to enable comparison and exchanges at European level.
Proposals should analyse how existing funding sources (including Horizon 2020, rural and regional development funds) are mobilised to support agro-ecological research and innovation initiatives approaches.
They should explore the interest of regional and national funders in supporting such activities in the long run and provide recommendations on the funding sources that could be combined and under which conditions (e.g. application requirements, monitoring and evaluation), looking for synergies and coherence. Proposals shall identify needs for training on LL/RI methods. They should prepare a training package matching the needs of various actors and pilot training activities for potential actors to be involved in future activities.
Involvement of Member States’ authorities is encouraged in order to ensure a strategic and long-term approach, along with a broad coverage of Europe. Transdisciplinary and integration of SSH and RRI are also encouraged. The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU up to EUR 2 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
This topic aims at mapping, analysing and providing recommendations to strengthen the European agro-ecological research and innovation ecosystem. In the short term, the project should:
provide a structured framework for the development of an initiative that develops synergies in this area at European level;
increase connections in the agro-ecological community and, if mature, prepare the community for the implementation of this initiative;
prepare the funders and raise their capacity to mobilise complementary funding sources;
improve the human and social capital as well as skills and methods for the development of living labs and research infrastructures in the field of agro-ecology;
improve capacity to tailor policy interventions to specific situations based on stronger evidence.
In the medium/long term, the project should provide for research and innovation projects and initiatives to benefit from the work of the network in terms of engagement of the relevant actors as well as availability of long-term-series and landscape level data regarding agro-ecological processes.

The bioeconomy includes sectors and systems that use, produce, process or are driven by biological resources. The successful transition towards the bioeconomy requires a profound transformation on both the supply and the demand sides of the economy and involve different multipliers (consumers, retailers, etc.). It is therefore important to raise public awareness and knowledge about the environmental and socio-economic impacts of activities on all bioeconomy areas among a wide range of stakeholders.
Scope:
Proposals will build upon sectoral communication activities at national, regional and local level through awareness raising about the bioeconomy at large for European citizens. The actions shall promote the environmental and socio-economic benefits of bioeconomy areas through awareness-raising and education on sustainable production, consumption and lifestyles.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU in the range of EUR 1 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
In the framework of the UN SDGs, this action will contribute to the implementation of the updated 2018 EU Bioeconomy Strategy[1]. It will also contribute to the overall awareness by European citizens about the bioeconomy.
In particular, this action will help European citizens (including young people) to:
Be aware of the bioeconomy and all its areas;
Be knowledgeable on sustainability and environmental protection;
Raise awareness on sustainable production, consumption and lifestyles;
Make more informed choices in the future when buying and consuming products;
Encourage the deployment of Bioeconomy Strategies at local level;

","20 September 2016
","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
New customised products will be increasingly incorporating, in a seamless fashion, intelligence and smart functionalities through advanced materials and embedded components. The integration of highly differentiated materials and components is a key requisite for flexible manufacturing of individualised consumer/customised products. On the other hand, enhanced integration of sophisticated ICT-based components and of advanced materials implies a rapid product obsolescence rate, and can thus introduce further pollution risks if reuse of products and/or components is not improved. Therefore, reconfiguration and reuse of products, and related services, need to be developed.
Scope:
To face sustainability and flexibility challenges customised products need to be conceived, designed and manufactured in a modular way, and their single components have to be developed so as to be interoperable with one another during the product/service lifetime, so as to be exchangeable and updateable whenever necessary. This influences both the hard and soft requirements and calls for new production technologies that enable the fast manufacturing, assembly and configuration of complex products, as well as the products updatability and disassembly for re-use and end of life management.
In particular, consumer goods manufacturers should be able easily and effectively to integrate products and components which can be independently designed, produced and used in order to make diverse final personalised products in different production systems.
All involved actors in the product life cycle, from manufacturers of basic products components to retailers and vendors up to the final customers, should be provided with the needed hard and soft tools to reassemble and/or reconfigure the product or its components.
Research activities should address all of the following areas:
Methodologies, engineering and tools for the fast reconfiguration and re-use of personalised products and their components
New production techniques allowing for a fast manufacturing, assembly and configuration of complex personalised products
Innovative methods and technologies for personalised products updatability, disassembly for reuse and end of life management of the products as well as their different components
Methodologies and tools for the development of assembly, configuration, disassembly and reconfiguration services along the whole consumer/customised products value chain and along its overall life cycle also including the aftersale stage.
The proposals are expected to include use-case demonstrations aiming at the rapid deployment of the new modularity, reconfiguration and re-use of personalised consumer/customised products and life cycle management. All relevant value-chain stakeholders are expected to participate, including relevant Social Sciences and Humanities (SSH) practitioners.
The resulting personalised products are expected to satisfy the final consumer needs at an individual level and consequently to facilitate daily life (particularly concerning elderly, disabled or other target groups with special needs) or improve workers and sportsmen safety and health.
Activities are expected to focus on Technology Readiness Levels 5 to 7 and to be centred around TRL6.
This topic addresses cross-KET activities.
This topic is particularly suitable for SMEs.
This topic is particularly suitable for collaboration at international level, especially regarding the involvement of multiple actors in complex value chains on a global scale for consumer/customised goods.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU between EUR 4 and 6 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
The developed new technologies should lead to a significant impact in terms of:
Reduction of time to market of new personalised products/services by 30% through a modular product/service design and manufacturing approach
Cost reduction of the manufacturing of personalised products by 25% by decreasing lead times in product-services development and configuration
Reduction of environmental impact by more than 50% due to modular reusable components and final products
Savings of overall products/services life cycle costs by 30% as a consequence of the reusability and re-adaptability of the components of the personalised products
Wide adoption of the technologies developed leading to increasingly flexible manufacturing of customised products
Proposals should include a business case and exploitation strategy, as outlined in the Introduction to the LEIT part of this Work Programme.

Specific challenge:In a very competitive environment, manufacturing enterprises will need to be attractive to potential workers. This will require new thinking both on scheduling of work and design of attractive and safe workplaces, taking into account the ageing workforce. The aim is to demonstrate the operation of a real smart factory, focusing on the interconnection between organisation, workforce, management and technology. This interconnection must be supported by new models for optimisation and utilisation of production systems to ensure efficient transfer of knowledge and information. This requires new ways of using new technologies (e.g. augmented reality), which are highly adaptable and able to address the task holistically. The new models must be able to support the workers’ tacit knowledge in the process of both controlling the production line and controlling advanced machinery. This will enhance synergy in the interaction between humans, technology and the organisation.
Scope: Demonstration activities should be multi-disciplinary, involving in particular as appropriate disciplines of Social Sciences and Humanities, and address all of the following areas:
-         Methodologies and tools for efficient design or re-adaptation of production facilities based on co-evolving product-process-production systems considering simultaneously productivity aspects and the wellbeing and autonomy of the workers, through the integration of technologies.
-         New methods and technologies for an optimised take-up and use of workers' knowledge, to stimulate team interactions and to enhance work related satisfaction taking into consideration safety and ergonomics of the working areas.
-         Integration of innovative production technologies supporting increased productivity and flexibility.
-          Incorporating aspects linked to education, workers' training and attractiveness to the young and the elderly (e.g. in-factory teaching, 'factory-lab' concepts).
Attractive research will support manufacturing enterprises in Europe in their respective efforts for talents to be employed in attractive manufacturing jobs. Proof of concept in terms of at least one industrial pilot demonstrator should be delivered before the end of the project, convincingly demonstrating a solution to industrial needs.
For this topic, proposals should include an outline of the initial exploitation and business plans, which will be developed further in the proposed project.
Wherever possible, proposers could actively seek synergies, including possibilities for funding, with relevant national / regional research and innovation programmes and/or cumulative funding with European Structural and Investment Funds in connection with smart specialisation strategies. For this purpose the tools provided by the Smart Specialization Platform, Eye@RIS3 may be useful[1]. The initial exploitation and business plans will address such synergies and/or additional funding. Exploitation plans, outline financial arrangements and any follow-up will be developed further during the project. The results of these activities as well as the envisaged further activities in this respect should be described in the final report of the project.
 Activities expected to focus on Technology Readiness Level 5-7. A significant participation of SMEs with R&D capacities is encouraged.
This topic is particularly suitable for collaboration at international level, particularly under the IMS scheme.[2] Project partnerships that include independent organisations from at least three IMS regions[3] are therefore encouraged.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU between EUR 4 and 7 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected impact:
The impact on the areas of application of the projects is expected to be:
                In social terms, an improvement in the working conditions in factories and in the attractiveness of the working environments in particular for young people.
                Improved work satisfaction of employees within the factories of the future.
                In economic terms, an increase of 10% in productivity due to an increased commitment of people, better organisation of work and by increasing the pool of potential workers through widening the skill profile.
                Strengthened global position of European manufacturing industry through the introduction of the new technologies.

Specific challenge: Responsible research and innovation has the potential to make research and innovation investments – public procurement included  –, more efficient, while addressing global societal challenges by fostering better knowledge and innovation co-production with society. It has also the potential to draw better lessons from early warnings with a view to more efficient precautionary approaches. However, the current research and innovation system do not routinely take into account RRI requirements. Systemic barriers to the uptake of RRI approaches include lack of recognition in the career system of academic research for RRI/trans-disciplinary approaches, in evaluation criteria and by scientific journals, a lack of market incentives to internalise external costs of innovation (environmental, social, etc.) an insufficient training of researchers, institutional barriers, etc.[1] It is key to develop concrete policy actions to overcome these barriers and to foster systemic change, e.g. towards better societal engagement in knowledge-production and innovation.
Scope: The action addresses systemic barriers to the implementation of Responsible Research and Innovation in research and innovation practices. The proposals shall aim to set the ground for concrete progress in relation to one of the various barriers (e.g. develop roadmaps, policy agendas, networks, coordination etc. during the lifetime of the project), identifying ways for better professional recognition and uptake of RRI approaches. Action for concrete progress could also focus on how to use existing instruments in different ways to implement systemic change: for example stimulating RRI implementation via using public procurement to start pre-commercial projects and to purchase innovative and sustainable products and services.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 1 and 1.5 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact: The action will lower the barriers to the implementation of RRI approaches. It will lead to structural change in current research and innovation policies and systems, which will expand and consolidate the use of RRI methods and standards. Activities will signpost EU research teams seminal work in this domain; they will ensure complementary action at Member States level, and set best case examples and implementation standards for the industry. In the medium term, they will foster the capacity of research and innovation to tackle societal challenges in close cooperation with societal stakeholders, addressing the risks and benefits and the respect of fundamental values.

Specific Challenge:
Evidence is needed on how the RRI approach, in particular the opening up of the innovation process to social actors, can improve the development process and the quality of the final outcomes of research and innovation in the industrial context. Existing initiatives such as Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) have set first steps but improved business governance is needed that deeply embeds creativity, scalability, responsiveness, ""glocality"", circularity and societal engagement.
Scope:
This action will support projects that demonstrate how to implement RRI in process development (via stakeholder involvement, taking account of gender differences, Corporate Social Responsibility, etc.) and in quality of the final outcomes (complying with standards relating to sustainability, precautionary principle, gender and ethics, among others). The proposals shall foster collaboration between actors from industry, research and civil society to jointly define and implement a concrete roadmap for the responsible development of particular technologies, products or services within up to three specific research/innovation fields, enabling a detailed comparative assessment. It can for example develop an RRI-inspired ‘CSR 2.0’ roadmap and implementation plan that is demonstrated, tested, and assessed by the partners involved in the action. Overall, the proposals shall pilot and demonstrate how industry and societal actors can work productively together according to the Responsible Research and Innovation approach, delivering practical evidence of the benefits for industry at large to follow up on a similar path.

Specific challenge: Research misconduct mainly became a focus of attention in the 1980's with a few publicised cases in the US. This progressively led to adoption of guidelines and codes of conduct by the scientific community as well as to the set-up of governmental structures. The complexity and diversity of research misconduct, amplified by the expansion of electronic communication still raises serious questions on the capacity of the actors concerned to adequately address the issue.
Scope: As there is no single approach to address research misconduct, the proposals examine the pros and cons of different methods. Among others, the real benefit of IT tools shall be evaluated. Clear figures are required on the number and variety of allegations in EU and other OECD countries, including the percentage of cases where original suspicion is confirmed and leads to some form of sanctions. Additionally, the in-depth study of representative cases shall bring a socio-economic and a psychological dimension which is critical to the design of effective responses. It will also be crucial to assess the possibility to unify the codes, principles and methods at EU and international level.

It will also decrease the number of cases of malpractice and the number of fabrications and cases of false positives in research and innovation results. The action will encourage transparency and ensure reliable knowledge transfer and ethical spill-over from academia to industry. In the medium term, improved research integrity will increase public trust in science and scientists; and boost trust in holders of research-related degrees shall they pursue other community leader position in politics and economics. In the long term, future researchers will be conscious of ethical principles from their educational years. Thereby the number of beneficiaries carrying out action in accordance with principles of research integrity will increase.

Specific challenge:
In the field of research, initiatives have been developed in European countries and beyond aiming at promoting gender equality. They include direct support to female researchers’ careers, specific awards, gender balance in decision-making, gender-budgeting the integration of a gender dimension in research and programmes. Some initiatives have a more comprehensive scope such as charters, performance agreements and gender equality plans. Others are tied with the funding of research organisations and Higher Education Institutions. They shall have been initiated by public authorities/entities or private organisations and have a national or regional scope. Few of these initiatives have been evaluated so far and there is no common framework methodology to conduct such evaluations in Europe.
Scope:
The proposals shall develop concepts and methodologies for the evaluation of initiatives mentioned above, providing an adequate analysis of how gender issues are considered in science management and policy-making and how they contribute to achieve three main objectives: equal participation and progression in research careers, gender balance in decision-making and the integration of a gender dimension in research content and programmes. The proposed evaluation framework shall cover a selected range of initiatives with a national or regional scope:
on research quality and productivity as well as innovation;
on research organisations and Higher Education Institutions in terms of structure; efficiency, competitiveness, quality of the workplace, recruitment capacity;
at research system level in terms of intensity and productivity.
The proposed framework covers a selected range of initiatives from several EU countries using a comparative approach. It will contribute to develop a common understanding of the reach, value and limits of such evaluations. The proposals should also include an appropriate involvement of policy-makers to help integrate the findings of the evaluations in research and innovation policies.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of the order of EUR 2 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected impact:
The research will provide concepts and methodologies fitted to conduct evaluation of gender equality initiatives in Europewith national or regional scope. It shall also provide a better understanding of the impacts of current gender equality initiatives, from the science-management and policy-making perspectives. This will help identify best practices to be promoted. In the medium term, it will help adapt gender equality initiatives and increase their efficacy, leading to an improved research intensity and productivity and furthering the progress towards the achievement of the European Research Area.[1]

Specific Challenge:The European Commission promotes a culture of openly sharing information among researchers, innovative industries and citizens. The technology continues to improve, thus making some innovative approaches possible. It is important to ensure that high levels of quality are maintained for research results. The release and dissemination of research results is a crucial element, but so are the measurement of their quality and impact with the right indicators.  There is a need to examine the situation from A to Z and adapt to the new solutions that better suit the needs of researchers, innovators, the public and funding bodies, and that are relevant to new technologies and expanding amounts of information.
Scope: From working on the public release of research results to evaluating their impact, the proposals shall seek in particular to examine how peer-review develops outside of traditional methods and support it, and how indicators and bibliometrics are adequate for different types of needs and promote them. With open access expanding beyond scientific articles to encompass data, monographs and books, it needs to be seen whether current methods of review and measurement of impact remain practical and relevant, or whether more innovative practices are needed, and how.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of the order of 2 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:The action will contribute to the development of more open and comprehensive as well as gender sensitive ways of conducting research and fostering innovation. The use of new technology has the potential to ensure originality as well as high-quality contributions to science. This will be of benefit to the optimal circulation of knowledge within the European Research Area. It will contribute not only to better science but also to a more open science system, while ensuring that the impact of scientific information on all actors of the society can be measured in a reliable way.

Specific challenge: Taking into account the progressive globalisation of research activities, there is a rising risk of research with sensitive ethical issues being conducted by European organisations outside the EU without proper compliance structures and follow-up. The risk of ethics dumping - the exportation of research practices that would not be accepted in Europe on ethical grounds - and the mechanisms to mitigate this risk shall be actively addressed.
Scope: The primary objective of this action is to address the risk of dumping for public and private research by promoting an active collaboration between European, national and international ethics bodies. The proposals shall involve different actors: ethics bodies, funding organisations, governmental actors, and Civil Society Organisations representing the interests of the local populations. Cooperation shall build up at multiple levels: within the EU, between the EU and other high-income countries, between high-income countries and low-income countries where the risks of dumping is higher. Activities shall be based on case studies involving local structures, avoiding gender bias, in countries where the research takes place and impacts population. Good practices shall be identified, with a view to elaborate an operational code of conduct for all actors concerned.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of the order of EUR 2 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected impact: This action will reduce the risks of ethics dumping in research and improve the adherence to high ethical standards in areas of the world where it is needed. As a consequence, research carried out outside the EU will be compliant and consistent with EU-based research and acceptable and exploitable in the EU. In the medium term, due to active collaboration on multiple levels and the sharing of good practices, research practices of research institutions outside the EU will be impacted and ameliorated. In the long term, highest ethical standards will spread globally, thus creating a level playing field and a clear structure of incentives for research competitiveness.

Specific challenge:
The Innovation Union Communication notes that “Europe must also develop its own distinctive approach to innovation which builds on its strengths and capitalizes on its values” These values frame the responsible and ethical conduct of research, a critical factor in achieving excellence and socially relevant impact. According to the Singapore Statement on Research Integrity, “the value and benefits of research are vitally dependent on the integrity of research”.
In the same spirit, the “European Code of Conduct for Research Integrity” states in its preamble that “science as the process of knowledge augmentation is embedded in a wider socio-ethical context, and scientists must be aware of their specific responsibility towards society and the welfare of mankind.
Research integrity is multi-dimensional and essentially entails that academic and industry researchers design their research taking into account its social impact, conduct the research in a responsible manner starting with the research design and the gathering of data. Integrity therefore implies the use of appropriate techniques and methodologies respecting the highest ethical standards. Once the results are available they should be reported in an accurate way and be widely and easily accessible. In all circumstances researchers should avoid any form of conflict of interest when performing, reviewing research or communicating research findings (notably in support to policy making). As regards scholarly publication, researchers should include all the necessary references to their work and to the work of others. Overall, research integrity thus covers the complete cycle of the process from the original idea to the output (paper, product, processes, scientific advice etc.).
Conversely, research misconduct can have two main consequences: (1) affect in the short and long run society trust in science as well as the trust in private and public research institutions, (2) harm people (including patients and other vulnerable populations) and the environment. For policy and funding institutions it has additional effects: if misconduct goes on undetected, it reduces return on investment of public and private funds, distorts the research funding market and can be seen as rewarding fraudulent behavior and tarnishing trust in the research management processes including peer review.
Scope:
Accurate estimates of the social and economic impact of research integrity are difficult to ascertain. They range from tabulations of actual personnel and legal costs involved in adjudication procedures for selected misconduct cases, to attempts of pricing reputation loss through stock price decline. In addition to the above, and on the basis of selected cases, the proposed study will examine the possibility of devising an appropriate methodology in order to be able to calculate the cost of the various impacts of research misconduct, including:
The impact on trust and reputation of research and innovation institutions (including loss of expertise and qualified personnel)
The impact on researchers’ carrier (salary, promotion, loss of employment etc)
The impact on the well being of citizens and on the environment. This should in particular cover the impact of inappropriate policies or products resulting from research misconduct. It notably covers (1) policy decisions based on falsified research results or biased scientific advice and (2) products (pesticides, medication etc.) put on the market further to a non rigorous scientific validation process.
Beyond the estimation of the economic impact of misconduct, the study should also, estimate the economic benefit that could be derived from a more responsible conduct of research (increase reproducibility of research findings, improving availability of research results, interactions with concerned actors when designing and performing research etc.) in the EU and worldwide. In addition to general figures, a few concrete and illustrative cases should be analysed to support the impact narrative.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of the order of EUR 1 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected impact:
A better understanding of the economic and social impact of research misconduct and responsible conduct of research will support the development of a coherent and efficient research integrity policy in the European Research Area.

         Removing barriers to the recruitment, retention and career progression of female researchers;
         Addressing gender imbalances in decision making processes;
         Strengthening the gender dimension in research programmes.
Scope: The action provides support to RPOs and RFOs in order to support systemic institutional changes, in particular through the implementation of Gender Equality Plans (GEPs). GEPs shall:
                Conduct impact assessment / audit of procedures and practices, including relevant data on HR management, teaching and research activities, in order to identify gender bias at organisation level;
                Implement innovative strategies to address gender bias; this should include family-friendly policies (e.g. work schedule’s flexibility; parental leave; mobility, dual-career couples); gender planning and budgeting; training on gender equality in Human Resources (HR) management; develop the gender dimension in research content and programmes; integrating gender studies in Higher Education Institution curricula;
                Set targets and monitor progress via indicators at organisation level.
 The RPOs, including Higher Education Institutions, and RFOs involved in the consortium shall be at a starting stage in the setting-up of gender equality plans and shall ensure the support from their highest management level. Participation of professional associations in the consortium is recommended. The proposals shall include a first assessment of gender issues in each partner organisation. They shall also situate the planned GEPs in relation with existing national provisions relating to gender equality in research, and explain how they will contribute to the achievement of the European Research Area (ERA)[2] objectives on gender equality. The proposals shall include a methodology for impartially monitoring and assessing the progress made throughout the duration of the project. This activity could be dedicated to a specific partner organisation or subcontracted. This action will be further promoted through the EURAXESS initiative SEAC.3.2014 Trans-national operation of the EURAXESS Service network.

Mainstream political parties are being increasingly perceived as not addressing adequately the challenges faced by the EU and its Member States. At the same time, support for populist parties, movements and ideas is on the rise. The challenge is to analyse the phenomenon of populism and its consequences for European democracies and the European project. In addition, innovative ways of understanding and addressing the causes of populism as well as strategies for strengthening democratic values and practices need to be identified.
Scope:
Proposals should analyse populism comprehensively, drawing also on historical and comparative perspectives, philosophical, sociological, cultural and gender-based explanations, and foresight. They should also examine whether and how populism is related to structural socio-economic mutations or destabilisations of politico-economic paradigms. The evolving character and emergence of new political parties as well as the role played by both traditional and social media and public opinion should be studied, including changes in political and social functions over time. The significance of charismatic leaders for the cause of populism should also be considered as well as other factors such as perceptions of elitism and establishments, which may attract citizens to populist movements. A central question should be how the potential of groups under-represented in public affairs, particularly younger citizens, to engage in public affairs and their civil responsibilities could be harnessed for constructive democratic engagement. The role of schools, local communities and digital media should be considered as well as new forms participation.
Proposals should also assess to what extent populism in Europe is tied up with negative orientations (e.g. anti-globalisation, anti-EU, anti-immigrants, anti-minorities), a sense of nostalgia or nativeness, and nationalist ideologies. Research should also investigate in which ways populism in Europe may be a transnational phenomenon and how it may have been affected by European integration. Comparisons between manifestations of populism inside and outside Europe, and over time, may be made. Research should also assess actions that have been taken to counter populism as well as how populism affects the policy-making process.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU in the order of EUR 3 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
The action will enhance the knowledge base on populism in comparative and historical perspective. It will develop indicators as well as medium to long-term scenarios on the consequences of populism, which will support policies, narrative construction and other actions to address the phenomenon.

Trust is a fundamental condition for a fair and cooperative society. It also plays an important part in contributing to social capital. While a degree of distrust may be required for a well-functioning democracy, waning trust in governments and other institutions and in the EU can impact European governance in multiple ways. The challenge is to restore and improve trust as a basis for sustainable and legitimate governance.
Scope:
Proposals should reappraise definitions of and approaches to trust in and between governments, in public authorities and other public institutions as well as in private actors having due regard to the philosophical, ethical and psychological foundations of trust and trustworthiness. This should include amongst others the EU, the Euro, political parties and financial systems, and may include markets and regulatory institutions, the media as well scientific expertise and institutions. Proposals should also investigate possible correlations between the levels of trust in national governments and in the EU as well as their underlying dynamics. The relationship between trust and distrust should be clarified to identify which levels are conducive to stable, sustainable and fair social relations and governance as well as the thriving of citizens. Factors contributing to and affecting trust in governance at various levels, including transparency and accountability, should be investigated too.
Proposals should identify potential thresholds of decreasing levels of trust, i.e. junctures when distrust becomes a game changer. They should also investigate, both empirically and normatively, possible relationships between trust and inequalities, trust and legitimacy as well as between trust and the quality of democracy. Possible correlations between trust, social inclusion and belonging should also be considered. In addition, research may consider whether and under what conditions participatory practices beyond electoral participation are trust enhancing including transparent and open decision-making. The role of civil society in the underlying dynamics of trust building should be investigated too. In addressing the issues above, experimental research should be performed as relevant. The action should also develop criteria, indicators and early warning mechanisms for detecting weak signals of decreasing trust. The role of the media, including social media, language, news generation and new phenomena such as fake news should be examined. Scenarios on consequences of (further) decreasing trust should be developed which may draw on experiences from outside Europe where relevant.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU in the order of EUR 3 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
By enhancing the knowledge base on trust, including the factors determining changes in trust, the action will feed into various initiatives to restore and improve trust in governance and enhance the quality of democracy. It will also contribute to improving trust in science and to constructing trust-enhancing narratives for national governments and EU governance.

","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Evidence suggests that wide inequalities can be detrimental to economic growth and social cohesion. It is clear that inequalities have been rising over the last three decades both in Europe and globally albeit with considerable geographical and temporal variation. The crises and their aftermath have put this rise of inequalities centre stage. A solid evidence base is needed to design and implement policy instruments which sustainably and fairly reverse this trend. A substantial body of research on inequalities, social investment and the welfare state exists and is coming to fruition. This gives rise to a pressing need to reap, synthesise, consolidate, and enhance the impact of existing and emerging research findings and to implement recommendations. A platform needs to be established that can feed the findings into the policy process and fosters an open and pluralistic research-policy dialogue.
Scope:
This coordination and support action should set up a network comprising the relevant research communities, policy makers, stakeholder representatives, non-governmental organisations, and possibly also social partners and local authorities, and ensuring broad geographical coverage. The network should draw inspiration from (emerging) theories of justice which connect with and reflect European values as well as the Pillar of Social Rights. It should take stock of data and of attitudes on the scale of accepted and acceptable inequalities, in relation to a range of dimensions such as income and wealth, education, health as well as the welfare state whereby gender and demographic aspects should be taken into account.
The network should assemble a comprehensive survey of the state of the art, including currently running research on inequalities conducted at EU and Member State level, duly taking into account historical dimensions. It should also consolidate comparative data sets on various dimensions of inequalities and, to the extent necessary, generate new data. Proposals should consider the repercussions of rising levels of socio-economic inequalities for democracy, governance and legitimacy. Particular attention should be paid to the young, immigrants and ethnic minorities whereby inequalities in education and health should be considered.
The network should also investigate under which conditions economic, social and cultural inequalities translate into political inequalities generally and whether and how this correlation is aggravated at EU level in comparison to Member State level. Conversely, research should ascertain under what conditions marginalised sectors of society can get their voices heard. A central question is to what extent political inequality is driven by institutional or more fundamental social and economic structures. The role of social security, social investment and welfare policies as well as broader taxation based redistribution in tackling and reversing inequalities should be examined in a context of changing labour relations, job quality and security as well as the content of work. Also, the impact of technological transformation on labour markets and inequalities should be considered. Living condition, spatial justice and territorial cohesion are key concerns as are the effectiveness and equitability of tax regimes as well as tax practices behaviour including tax avoidance and optimisation.
The network should also synthesise and evaluate the research conducted under the DIAL ERA-Net Dynamics of Inequalities across the Life Course [1] on how inequalities evolve across the life-course where a particular focus should lie on the identification of crucial demographic events which may determine and influence the risk of poverty and exclusion.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of EUR 1.5 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
The action will assemble and synthesise the state of the art of the knowledge base. It will facilitate improved data collection by inter alia drawing on the EU Statistics on Income and Living Conditions (EU-SILC) database and other relevant instruments from Eurostat as needed for the design of policies and solutions required to adequately address inequalities. It will garner and formulate policy recommendations which will contribute to improving European outcomes in relation to social cohesion. By mobilising and linking experts and pertinent stakeholders, the action will foster a concrete, specific and structured dialogue between research and policy-makers with a view to reducing inequalities. The network will also propose new research agendas.

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Almost three decades after the End of History essay and debates democracy faces significant challenges. Political developments have been marked by the rise of political forces and discourses promoting populism and nationalism and questioning liberalism. These are often couched in a language of anti-elitism and anti-cosmopolitanism as they seek to profit from citizens’ frustration at their socio-economic situation and political shortcomings of democracies. Social, cultural, economic, technological and political challenges related to the legitimacy, accountability, transparency, levels of engagement and effectiveness of democracies need to be addressed normatively and empirically with a view to averting a fundamental crisis in democratic standards.
Scope:
The coordination and support action should bring together the relevant research community with representatives of civil society, as well as socio-economic and policy stakeholders (at European, national and sub-national levels). Proposals should adopt a holistic approach and ensure broad geographic coverage. The network should consider the altering capacity of parties, parliaments and executives to represent citizens. At the same time, it should address changes in voting behaviour such as growing abstention, increasing volatility and preference for extreme political discourses and their potential to sap the foundations of democracy. The role of referenda, also in relation to traditional and social media, should be part of the reflection. Moreover, the network should deliberate to what extent higher levels of distrust towards elected bodies and institutions and the political class could be signalling a more deep rooted shift towards a popular preference for outcomes over political participation and rights. Consideration should be given to political processes that may lead to a weakening of the institutions and laws that guarantee checks and balances, civil liberties, human rights and the rule of law. Different democratic traditions and pathways and how they affect policy responses should also be examined. A historical perspective should be adopted in tracing the political and sociological roots of current populist movements and parties.
Attention should be given to the role of supranational institutions and the ways in which they affect democracies. The role of identities, including European identity, for democratic governance could also be considered. Gender aspects should be taken into account. Moreover, the interaction between corporations and democratic institutions, including various forms of lobbying, needs to be better understood normatively and empirically. Additionally, the ways high levels of inequality impact political engagement and disenfranchisement should be part of the reflection and policy answers. Lastly, attention should be paid to the opportunities for participation and openness generated by new technologies and how these could connect to citizens’ movements.
Proposals should adopt a forward-looking perspective. The network should organise dialogues over the long-term dynamics of modern democracies. These dynamics should be examined against the backdrop of technological transformations and their impact on transparency, participation, the media and accountability. Moreover, developments should be considered in relation to the need for greater social and ecologic sustainability. Proposals should equally build on democratic theory and innovation in order to enhance participation and engagement and where appropriate go beyond traditional notions of representative democracy. The network should also synthesise and evaluate the research conducted under the ERA-NET “Renegotiating democratic governance in times of disruptions” (H2020-SC6-GOVERNANCE-14-2018).
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of EUR 1.5 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
The network will take stock of research findings and promote wide trans- and interdisciplinary dialogues with a view to re-invigorating, modernising and enhancing democracies. The narratives, discourses and scientifically robust recommendations generated will enhance public policy debates and decision making on democracy. The network will equally propose new research agendas.

","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Government funding of social services is often capped and undergoing reductions while other sources of funding are fragmented or highly uneven. There are also disparities in the delivery of social performance and difficulties in transposing regional or national best practices to other regions or Member States and in scaling up such practices to the EU level. In addition, significant geographical variation exists between Western and Central and Eastern European Countries (CEECs).
Scope:
This coordination and support action will establish a consortium composed of a representative set of actors involved in the financing of social services and their provision such as venture philanthropists, foundations, social impact investors, government agencies and/or social service providers. The consortium will set up a European Social Catalyst Fund that will be funded jointly by the European Commission and the members of the consortium, i.e. the consortium will be under the obligation of signing on to the project. The Fund shall be of at least EUR 600.000, with the EU contribution accounting for a maximum of 25%, and it will put forward a call for proposals that will result in at least five social innovation implementation plans.
The proposal must clearly detail a fixed and exhaustive list of the different types of socially impactful activities supporting the priorities of the European Commission, including the European Pillar of Social Rights, for which a third party may receive financial support via the European Social Catalyst Fund. Examples of priority areas include aging, poverty and marginalisation, homelessness, vulnerable populations including people with disabilities, mental health difficulties and dementia, digital inclusiveness, employment and job creation, inequalities, education and training, skills, community development, the role and place of young people in the society, and intergenerational solidarity. Links to the Sustainable Development Goals of Agenda 2030 could be considered.
The proposal should define the organisational process for selecting the implementation plans for which financial support will be granted, including the process of selecting, allocating and reporting on the use of independent experts and ensuring no conflicts of interest. It should also clearly detail the criteria for awarding financial support and simple and comprehensive criteria for calculating the exact amount of such support. The open call must be published widely, including on the Horizon 2020 Participant Portal and through National Contact Points.
The selected implementation plans should demonstrate a capacity to valorise unexploited potential by transposing or scaling up regional or national best practices. The plans should also offer means of overcoming geographical fragmentation by being implementable in at least five EU Member States of which at least two in Central and Eastern Europe. Plans should be implementable within a maximum of two years. The network should improve the selected plans as needed—striving towards them reaching investment grade—and oversee their implementation. In the process, it should help de-risk innovations, unlock bottlenecks at system level, overcome agency problems (e.g., when no one stakeholder benefits enough to justify the cost) and stimulate projects with marginal profitability. The network should specify how it will monitor and report on call results and how it will assess the quality of the outcomes and measure the impact achieved.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of EUR 250.000 of which at least EUR 150.000 should go to the Catalytic Fund would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
The action will strengthen the capacity of organisations and/or individuals to develop and upscale innovative and effective solutions to pressing societal challenges. It will contribute to the diffusion of solutions in a timely and geographically balanced manner. It will also raise awareness on the opportunities and challenges associated to social innovation in the provision of social services.

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Given the weight and importance of the public sector in driving economic growth and competitiveness, tightening government budgets, increasing expectations of greater citizen participation in the design and delivery of public services and societal challenges that require new solutions, there is an urgent need to promote innovation and experimentation in the public sector. The purpose is to improve continuously the development of public policy, as well as the efficiency and delivery of public programs and services, and to enhance thereby the creation of public value.
Scope:
Governments are currently facing accelerating technological and social changes. The complexity and interdependence of today’s 'wicked problems' require radically new approaches to public policy, regulation and service delivery. There is increased pressure on governments to work differently and more efficiently, to engage more with citizens and to transform their operations to harness the opportunities afforded by digital technologies and to adapt faster to emerging challenges. Driving systemic change requires change-makers and champions of innovation within the public sector, as government is the best placed to scale up meaningful solutions. This will require sweeping changes of mind-set and modus operandi in public authorities. As the role of the state evolves, governments must become proactive problem solvers and close collaborators with a wide variety of stakeholders throughout the innovation ecosystem to co-create new solutions.
A growing number of governments are strongly committed to improving their policies, programmes and services. Shifting to a user-centric focus that puts the citizen at the centre, public actors increasingly recognise the need for inclusive and sustainable responses to societal challenges. Most government innovation projects, however, stay small and never scale up to the point where they can make a difference within government administrations in the long run. Innovation is not yet considered a strategic function of government, or the core business of public administrators. There is therefore a need to support governments’ internal innovation efforts through an exchange of experiences and by concrete practical support based on their needs, in order to move from sporadic innovations to systemic transformations.
Based on the achievements and work of the Observatory of Public Sector Innovation managed by the OECD, governments would benefit from further knowledge sharing in an international context, collaboration and support in the practical application of new knowledge in areas of specific interest (e.g. system thinking and systemic transformations, experimentation, co-creation with the ecosystem, stakeholder engagement, dealing with complexity; matrix organizations; organizational culture development; innovation skills development; organizational frameworks conducive to innovation, innovation in regulation, etc.) in real life contexts. Building on this experience, the activity should focus on the following:
Developing and piloting practice-led reflections and learning programmes to support governments in their role as change agents (e.g. skills, mindset, organizational culture, hackathons, boot camps for public leaders and administrators);
Fostering an international conversation, allowing for exchange of experiences and peer learning between governments, including intensifying collaboration among public innovation practitioners (including workshops, developing common projects for incubation in real life contexts) in order to support the development of innovators in government.
Developing a new public sector innovation theory (instead of existing attempts using the business innovation logic) that will support better measurement of public sector innovation in an internationally comparative manner.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of EUR 1.5 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts. Demonstration of applicants' own investment to complement the available Commission contribution would be an asset.
Expected Impact:
The action will deliver learning programmes, (inter-governmental) collaborative projects and a growing body of practical experiences and knowledge, which will support the development of a 21st century model of innovative governance and government. The action will also contribute to embedding innovation as the new normal in government operations and to building inclusive and sustainable innovation communities in the public sector.

","Research and Innovation action
","05 November 2019
","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Liberal democracies have come under pressure in recent times. Political distrust, polarizing discourses, lower electoral participation and populist narratives that reject the idea of an open society manifest themselves in Europe and beyond, with very strong support. The challenge therefore is to examine whether and how deliberative and participatory approaches – theoretically and practically – can fulfil the promise of greater and more enlightened participation in the present context and reach out to include those alienated from the political process. The difficulties deliberative and participatory approaches may face are also important to appraise.
In the last two decades deliberative and participative democracy has become increasingly prominent as a response to the challenges besetting liberal representative democracies. Premised on notions of direct democracy, active citizenship and decisions reached through argumentation, these new practices of democracy has in theory the potential to revive democratic legitimacy and help close the gap between citizens and political elites, who are often perceived as representing powerful interest groups.
Scope:
Research should elucidate the complex links between political discourses and identities (including populistic standpoints), dialogue guided by reasoned argumentation and the potential for achieving consensus on policy choices. Projects should also consider issues pertaining to effective participation in deliberative and participatory processes (especially as regards vulnerable groups and the politically less active) and as to how effectively these are translated by governments and institutions into concrete action. Research should equally examine how deliberative and participatory processes relate to polarisation and how (or if) it can assist in reaching mutual understanding among citizens with different views and positions. Lastly, attention should be paid to how deliberative and participatory democracy can best complement representative institutions. Issues of coordination, complementarity, scaling up (of such practices) but also opening up more traditional representative institutions should be examined.
The impacts of technology need to be further illuminated. Re-evaluating and re-assessing the contribution of digital technology in implementing deliberative, participatory (and by extension direct) democracy is needed. Projects should offer exhaustive assessments of experiments and innovations in deliberative and participatory processes highlighting success and failure factors. The role of the internet should equally be examined (also in connection to social media) in light of recent trends, which have cast doubt on its capacity to act as a platform of rational communication between equal participants.
In the EU context, the notion of the public sphere, as a key deliberative element, should be reconsidered both conceptually and empirically in view of the economic, social and political crises and developments of recent years. This includes a reappraisal of the question whether there is, could, or should be a European public sphere, which could enrich the democratic quality and the liberal character of the EU, in a context where supra-national European institutions are often perceived as insufficiently democratic and transparent.
Research should examine how the concept of deliberative and participatory democracy could be used and adapted to facilitate such a process and whether and how it is compatible with polarization tendencies, which have been prevalent in recent years. It needs to be investigated whether these new trends contribute to social justice, how societies can be made not only more inclusive but also more reflective, and how critical capacity and attitudes can be developed which revive deliberative democratic discourses. In this context, the contribution of the education system needs to be worked out. Connections should be made with questions of (European) identity, whereby the focus should not lie on an essentialist conception of identity, but reflexive identity, which signifies a critical and transformative self-understanding. Research should investigate how to create arenas or spaces open to citizens which are conducive to collective decisions made through public deliberation. Cooperation with partners from third countries, from both established and emerging democracies, is encouraged in order to have comparative perspectives that would be an important value added for the impact of the project.
A set of concrete actions could look at experimental and participative approaches to civic and social life, and suggest pathways for strengthening democracies at all levels, in terms of concrete actions, pilot projects and experimentation. They could build on previous results of international, European and other projects in these areas. In a context where citizen involvement and citizen participation in research and innovation is strongly stressed for Horizon Europe, this proposal could help to lay the groundwork.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU in the order of EUR 3 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. This does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
This action will move to another level our understanding of deliberative and participatory democratic processes and identify ways of how they can be improved in practice. Research should make this action on how to create arenas or spaces open to citizens which are conducive to collective decisions made through public deliberation. Proposals should outline methods and policies by which democratic practices can be strengthened in order to rebuild trust in political, economic and social institutions.

","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
The intended new governance of R&I policy at EU level relies on a combination of co-creation across policy fields and co-design with relevant stakeholders, as part of an open, transparent and cooperative relation between science and society. This implies developing a shared understanding and common views on policy challenges and opportunities based on sound evidence and continuous exchanges with policy advisors and shapers active at national level. In that regard, there is a need to help the transparent networking of R&I Think Tanks across the EU to strengthen and enlarge their input to the co-design of R&I policy.
Scope:
The coordination and support action should support the networking of R&I Think Tanks across the EU, with the aim to inform EU and national policy-making and help develop and share common views needed for co-designing the EU R&I policy. Proposals should demonstrate the capacity to develop existing informal or self-organised collaborations across national Think Tanks and/or R&I policy advisers into an actual European network of R&I Think Tanks, to achieve efficiency and effectiveness in codesigning R&I policies.
The network should bring together think tanks or advisory communities already organised at national level, and increase their cross-border collaboration and capacity to deliver strategic policy advice at European level. The network should aim at enhancing trust and coherence amongst its members, through transparent, open and collaborative processes involving national and European policy-makers, research and innovation communities and citizens. While the new network should help shape and spread new ideas about EU R&I policy, it should also capture and discuss emerging trends to make R&I policy more impactful and develop methodologies and approaches for co-designing policies with a clear EU added value.
Specific objectives of this action:
The network will greatly increase the capacity and diversity of R&I policy advice available in each Member State, by opening up the possibility for national Think Tanks to source or discuss expertise and advice from Think Tanks in other Member States.
The network will allow to rapidly bringing to the fore and debating new R&I policy concepts, through e.g. an annual event, in view of developing a common understanding and supporting the coherence of policy making processes across the EU.
The Commission considers that a consortium requesting a contribution from the EU in the order of EUR 0.5 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
Opening up and connecting policy advisers and R&I communities will add value to the governance of the European research and innovation system, will have a measurable impact for policy makers, R&I communities and citizens, and will lead to policies with more relevance and impact.
In the short term, the action will reinforce network collaboration between national R&I policy advisers, with the prospect in the medium term to offer a sounding board for national and EU policy-makers alike. In the longer term, it will facilitate the strategic alignment of R&I policies in Europe by supporting the uptake and dissemination of research and innovation best practices and questioning.

Deadline date","Scope:
Specific challenge: Europe has to face tough challenges in the field of air quality, noise and environmental protection, traffic congestion, competiveness and jobs preservation. This calls for new and more efficient mobility concepts. L category vehicles are well placed to answer the demands for less energy consumption and affordability. They represent an attractive solution in congested cities with scarce parking space. The challenge is to develop a new generation of electrified powertrains for L category vehicles that are quiet, clean, energy efficient and safe and to investigate radically new light vehicle concepts for personal mobility in urban areas.
Scope: Proposals should focus on energy efficiency improvements for a wide range of vehicle types (from mopeds to quads and light quadricycles). Research will address cost efficiency, integration and modularity of battery packs, electric and plug-in hybrid power trains, system integration and innovative vehicle architecture. The scope also includes the development and proof of concept of new ultra-light vehicles for passengers taking into account their integration with infrastructure and, where appropriate, considering any necessary changes to homologation requirements and regulations to allow their use. The project results will be validated through demonstrators.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 5 to 8 million each would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected impact: The research will contribute to a significantly reduction  of emissions (real driving emissions below Euro 5 level should be demonstrated for hybrids) and noise, congestion, greenhouse gas emissions and energy consumption. The research will also enhance the competitive position of the European industry. Research in this area will also support the implementation of the Clean Power for Transport strategy by developing the next generation of alternatively powered light urban e-vehicles.

Projects should contribute to at least two of the following expected outcomes:
Evidence of the innovation potential of the cultural and creative industries based in the EU.
Evidence of the role of the cultural and creative industries as drivers of innovation in other economic sectors such as industry and services.
Evidence of direct and indirect effects on the EU economy by the cultural and creative industries, economic spill-over effects on other sectors and the potential for further economic growth and employment in the cultural and creative industries.
Evidence of how cultural and creative EU industries could benefit from new technologies, new business models, skills development, new distribution and/or promotion models.
Proposals for further strengthening the competitiveness and drawing benefit from the innovation potential of the sector in the EU and in the international markets.
Scope:
The cultural and creative industries (CCI)[1] are an important source of growth and job creation in the European economy. The growth of this sector has raised interest at policy level for its innovation potential and for contributing to improved competitiveness. The challenge is to understand how to realise the full potential of CCIs as a driver for innovation[2], create stronger links with other sectors and contribute to strengthening the European economy, society and its sustainability.
The cultural and creative industries are as diverse as our cultures. Building on our cultural heritage and using their creativity, they pursue a wide variety of activities, ranging from cultural performances to creative design of products and shaping the public image of countries and regions. The CCI sector counts many self-employed, as well as some very large market players for example in the audio-visual and music sectors. Markets in this sector are heterogeneous and there is no comprehensive mapping at EU level. The CCI sector has been growing rapidly and, in some regions of Europe, it is outperforming more established sectors in terms of growth and employment.
The cultural and creative industries have been heavily affected by the COVID-19 pandemic crisis. The social confinement is likely to have a long-term impact by significantly reducing incomes and adding to unemployment. These problems will need to be taken into consideration in research, including proposals for reinvigorating the sector.
Research proposals should explore the innovation potential of the cultural and creative industries, their role as drivers of innovation in other sectors and the potential for strengthening competitiveness. This could involve strengthening links between science and art. The research should involve the CCIs and other creative actors themselves, policy makers and other stakeholders in order to ensure that the activities are relevant to the end users. Research should study how cultural and creative EU industries could benefit from new technologies, new business models, skills development, new distribution and/or promotion models with the purpose of strengthening their performance. Research should also identify policy measures for further strengthening the competitiveness and drawing benefit from the innovation potential of the sector in the EU and the international markets.

Projects should contribute to at least two of the following expected outcomes:
Develop and strengthen the use of digital technologies to protect, preserve, restore and safeguard cultural heritage and the arts in complementarity to other research methods.
Facilitate and widen access to cultural assets through digital and cutting-edge technologies and tools, in parallel or as an alternative to physical access to cultural heritage.
Support comparative analysis with artificial intelligence, including analysis across time, and other digital means to improve innovation and knowledge exchange in the cultural and creative sectors.
Increase the competitiveness of cultural and creative industries in the internal market and internationally, and provide opportunities for new and sustainable jobs creation.
Explore the role of digital tools, such as 3D/4D simulations, virtual and augmented reality technologies in engaging with cultural heritage during and after the COVID-19 crisis.
Use digital tools and other outcomes to provide efficient and global solutions to the real needs of accessing, protecting and preserving cultural heritage, including the “born digital” one.
Scope:
Digital technologies, from 3D simulation to artificial intelligence and virtual/augmented reality, are being used to ensure preservation and wide access to cultural heritage and the arts. Extensive research has been already funded to support the digitisation of libraries and archives, virtual tours of museums and archaeological sites, as well as digital curation and preservation of cultural goods. However, there is need to expand and further support the application of digital tools to preserve cultural heritage and to make it widely accessible. The relation between cultural heritage and its digitised format through the experience of audiences is of particular interest. Moreover, the “born digital” heritage, in parallel to the digitised one, is becoming of increased importance, requiring further research on its intrinsic value and limitations of use.
The role played by digital during the recent COVID-19 pandemic crisis is especially noteworthy, as it proved to be the most valuable means to access cultural assets during the extended period of confinement. Museums and libraries offered free access to their collections, artists were performing live online and theatres where streaming their performances through the web to help lift up people’s morale and improve their well-being. Assessing the impact of these activities and drawing lessons in view of future crisis management requires targeted research.
Taking these points into account, R&I actions under this topic are envisaged to promote extended digitisation so that collections, artefacts and monuments, including the “born digital” heritage, can be preserved, restored and safeguarded in a sustainable and user-friendly way. At the same time, research should prevent any potential negative consequence of doing so. In addition, digitisation practices have to comply with intellectual property law, in particular copyright law. They should develop digital facilities that will allow building shared infrastructures, provide specialised trainings and courses and facilitate knowledge and know-how exchange to address real needs in the field of cultural heritage. Projects should thus increase the use of existing tools and cutting-edge technologies, such as virtual and augmented reality or artificial intelligence, to reduce access and knowledge limitations to cultural assets. By assessing the role of digitisation in engaging with culture and cultural heritage during the COVID-19 crisis, they should draw lessons and provide resilient policy scenarios or recovery tools for the cultural and creative sectors in a post-crisis era. By creating new or fostering existing tools, they should aim at boosting the socio-economic sustainability of cultural and creative industries in the COVID-19 post-crisis period and provide sustainable applications and solutions to strengthen their innovation potential as well as manage future crises. This requires collaboration between technological firms, research institutes, universities and cultural and creative sectors/industries to generate tailor made know-how and transfer expertise to foster the digital transformation of Cultural Heritage institutions. Innovative approaches to R&I including user-led innovation could be applicable.
R&I actions funded under this topic are expected to establish the state of the art of digital methodologies and tools to protect the rich and diverse European cultural heritage, including the “born digital” heritage, in complementarity with more established conservation and protection methods. Data and products coming from the Copernicus services, specifically Copernicus Emergency, Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring, Climate Change and Copernicus Land Monitoring Services can give a great support in preserving cultural and natural heritage sites.

Projects are expected to contribute to all of the following outcomes:
An improved and professionalised NCP service across Europe, in the areas covered by Horizon Europe Cluster 2 ‘Culture, Creativity and Inclusive Society’, thereby helping simplify access to Horizon Europe calls, lowering the entry barriers for newcomers, and raising the average quality of proposals submitted;
A more consistent level of NCP support services across Europe.
Widening participation to projects in the areas covered by Horizon Europe Cluster 2 ‘Culture, Creativity and Inclusive Society’ to new stakeholders, such as civil society organisations.
Enhanced integration of the Social Sciences and Humanities (SSH) as a crosscutting issue throughout Horizon Europe.
Implementation of other horizontal activities of Cluster 2, including the organisation of Information Days, NCP trainings, brokerage events and monitoring of SSH integration across the research programme.
Scope:
Proposals should aim to facilitate trans-national co-operation between National Contact Points (NCPs) in the areas covered by Horizon Europe Cluster 2 ‘Culture, Creativity and Inclusive Society’, with a view to identifying and sharing good practices and raising the general standard of support to programme applicants. In addition, the action will provide important feedback on issues relating to programme planning, design and evaluation.
In view of the changes brought about by the adoption of Horizon Europe, the network of NCPs will organise transnational events to communicate with all interested scientific communities regarding new research actions; to draw lessons from previous research programmes on best practice for cooperation; to help researchers prepare for new funding schemes and structures.
The network will organise NCP Information Days, NCP trainings, brokerage events for potential applicants and provide appropriate tools and instruments to support NCPs and researchers. Activities will support researchers of the social sciences and humanities to connect into all Clusters of Horizon Europe. To achieve its expected outcomes and objectives, the NCP network could cooperate with but should not duplicate actions foreseen in other thematic and horizontal Horizon Europe NCP networks.
Proposals should include a work package to implement matchmaking activities to link up potential participants from widening countries with emerging consortia in the domain of Cluster 2. Matchmaking should take place by means of online tools, brokerage events, info days and bilateral meetings between project initiators and candidate participants from widening countries. Other matchmaking instruments may be used as appropriate. Where relevant, synergies should be sought with the Enterprise Europe Network to organise matchmaking activities in accordance with Annex IV of the NCP Minimum Standards and Guiding Principles.
The action will also contribute to the monitoring of the integration of social sciences and humanities (SSH) throughout the research programme, in particular through the provision of the analysis of statistical data necessary for the annual SSH monitoring reports.
Special attention should be given to enhancing the competence of NCPs, including helping less experienced NCPs rapidly acquire the know-how built up in other countries. This should contribute to increase the quality of proposals submitted, including those from countries where success rates in Horizon 2020 Societal Challenge 6 were lower than average.
The consortium should have a good representation of experienced and less experienced NCPs.
Submission of a single proposal is encouraged. NCPs from EU Member States or Associated Countries choosing not to participate as a member of the consortium should be identified and the reason explained in the proposal. These NCPs are nevertheless invited and encouraged to participate in the project activities (e.g. workshops), and the costs incurred by the consortium for such participation (e.g. travel costs paid by the consortium) may be included in the estimated budget and be eligible for funding by the Commission.
The proposal should cover the whole duration of Horizon Europe.

Explore new ways of participatory cultural management and sustainable financing for museums and other cultural institutions, in particular during and after times of crises such as the coronavirus pandemic.
Ensure better access to cultural heritage and engagement with local communities, to preserve and strengthen social cohesion through inclusive and participatory procedures.
Strengthen the sense of belonging to a common European space while respecting cultural and ethnolinguistic diversity, as well as developing an awareness of cultural pluralism.
Promote the role of museums and other cultural institutions in well-being, health, resilience, social inclusion and society’s dealing with trauma and post-crisis recovery.
Foster the role of museums and other cultural institutions in sustainable economic growth and regional development.
Scope:
Museums and other cultural institutions (such as libraries, galleries, archives, memorial sites, etc.) play a key-role in social inclusion and cohesion. They create the sense of belonging, build shared identities, promote cultural awareness and historical reflection, improve people’s well-being and contribute to sustainable development and growth at local, regional and national level. Nowadays, museums and other cultural institutions are facing several challenges such as scarce funding, new legal obligations with regard to their collections (e.g. related to intellectual property rights), insufficient numbers of visitors or, to the other extreme, massive tourist crowds, which necessitate new and expensive conservation means and security tools. All these challenges are threatening the existence and efficient work of museums and other cultural institutions.
Adding to the aforementioned challenges, the lockdown during the COVID-19 pandemic has heavily affected museums, other cultural institutions, arts and the entire ecosystem around them. Museums closed down for months, leaving staff unemployed and putting at risk cultural goods, as forced closing and absence of curators can severely impact the conservation and safety of collections.
On the other hand, cultural institutions have demonstrated great resilience and creativity in communicating with their publics remotely during the COVID-19 pandemic. Notwithstanding the general lockdown, the cultural sector, fully aware of the important role of culture, immediately mobilised itself to maintain activities and ease people’s feeling of isolation. Using digital technology and artificial intelligence, museums, other cultural institutions and artists offered new possibilities to access heritage and knowledge by participating in online cultural events, developed new creative business models and provided new training and capacity-building programmes to support cultural circles, and strengthened their presence in the internet and social media.
In light of the post-COVID era, museums and other cultural institutions will need to be the agents of a truly holistic and inclusive revival, as well as the developers of the new normality. They will be called to give people a sense that their life is no longer in abeyance, help to keep up the morale and be essential markers of people’s re-engagement with their cultural heritage. Therefore, there is a pressing need to ensure methods of sustainable financing in order to help museums and other cultural institutions recover quickly, continue operate in a safe and viable way and widen as much as possible access to citizens. Although the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic as far as economic losses and jobs are concerned cannot be fully predicted yet, international organisations, such as the UNESCO, ICOM, NeMO and OECD provide already recommendations for measures to be put in place. Furthermore, national authorities have started allocating recovery funds that could also benefit the cultural institutions’ sector. However, these measures are only partial, short-term solutions and do not solve the sector’s structural financing issues. Signals from the sector indicate that in particular smaller, local museums without (or with limited) structural governmental funding, suffer disproportionally.
Therefore, R&I proposals under this topic should explore ways to mitigate the challenges that museums, other cultural institutions and the entire ecosystem around them are facing nowadays, including the social and economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic. They should provide methods and models to sustainably finance cultural institutions, while ensuring equal and wide access to culture, heritage and cultural goods. Emphasis should be put on the role of local museums and new ways of participatory cultural management to help museums and other cultural institutions become fully embedded in cities’ life, taking also into account the differences between metropolis and small towns. A digital strategy might be developed as part of the new management and financing model, including sustainable ways of sharing knowledge and facilities to communicate through and about objects and collections of both tangible and intangible cultural heritage. Proposals are encouraged to include close interaction with local, regional and national communities and authorities, as well as cooperation with research institutions and the cultural and creative stakeholders (e.g. artists, actors, interpretation specialists, designers) to attract and engage the public and in particular young people.

Projects should contribute to at least two of the following expected outcomes:
Contribute to the objectives of the Green Deal by developing methods to conserve, preserve and restore monuments and artefacts with respect to different materials in a sustainable, green way.
Promote research on the quality of conservation, in order to foster a more sustainable and green maintenance and restoration of cultural heritage. Ensure higher quality standards in conservation and restoration of Europe’s cultural heritage.
Improve sustainability and energy efficiency in heritage sites, museums and other cultural institutions.
Strengthen citizens’ contribution to safeguarding of their cultural heritage and art.
Scope:
Materials and methods for the conservation and restoration of cultural heritage can often be energy consuming, not environmentally friendly or even harmful for the health of operators and curators. Moreover, many of these materials and methods prove to be neither durable nor sustainable, often leading to repetitive and costly restoration of artefacts, monuments and heritage sites. Research has already addressed this challenge to a certain extent; yet, the wide range of materials, types of buildings and monuments, and the specific needs of artefacts call for further investigation and tailored solutions.
In this context, and in view of achieving the objectives of the Green Deal, proposals under this topic should provide solutions and explore ways for quality conservation and restoration in a green and sustainable way. They should adopt and apply a holistic approach in conservation of art materials through an interdisciplinary network of knowledge and skills from the perspectives of hard sciences, soft sciences and engineering. Thanks to this, they should develop effective and sustainable strategies that are feasible, user friendly, affordable and safe to the operators and the artefacts, in order to ensure the long-term conservation of and physical access to cultural heritage resources. Monitoring the preservation status of artefacts, monuments and sites with non-intrusive, green tech solutions should also be considered. The proposed materials and methods for remedial or preventive conservation and restoration should be green, durable and sustainable. They should also minimize their environmental footprint[1] and impact on health of restorers, curators and craftspeople. Whenever necessary, they should also contribute to energy efficiency and sustainability of monuments, historic buildings and cultural institutions. Elaboration of traditional methods and materials, as well as digital and cutting-edge technologies should be developed or further exploited as necessary.
Taking into account environmental, social and economic impacts, proposals should bring together basic and applied research, social, cultural and entrepreneurial innovation through the involvement of cultural and creative sectors to ensure sustainability. Participation of innovative industry and/or CCIs/SMEs, besides public entities and policy makers, is strongly advised. Awareness raising and further strengthening of citizens’ and young people’s involvement in new or traditional preservation and transmission methods should also be targeted to widen literacy, access to and engagement with cultural heritage.

Comprehensive stocktaking of developments over the last decade, so that the European Union’s democracy support efforts can both regain traction and be revamped where necessary.
Development of an improved policy toolkit for supporting liberal democracy in the European Union’s neighbourhood, paving the way for more stability and cooperation.
Evidence base for the mid-term review of the implementation of the Action Plan for Human Rights and Democracy 2020-2024.
Reflection on the European Union’s aspiration and role in supporting democracy in its neighbourhood.
Scope:
Since the EU Council conclusions of 2009, EU democracy support has evolved and has been fine-tuned, with advances and setbacks. Following the adoption of the EU strategic framework on human rights and democracy in 2012, the EU adopted three Action Plans[1] in order to implement its commitments and reach its goals. The current Action Plan covers years 2020-2024[2].
Despite the hopes raised by the ‘colour revolutions’ in Eastern Europe in the 2000s and the Arab Spring in 2011 as boosters of democratisation in the European neighbourhood, a more troubling reality persists: some democratic advances coexist with the continued persistence of authoritarian rule in Eastern Europe, the Middle East and North African countries. Research should assess the EU’s actual role in promoting democracy. It should examine the EU’s influence on political governance in the neighbourhood, its capacity to react and address potential gaps between the declared intentions, and the results and consequences of its democracy support policies. Critical reflection should facilitate understanding of the dynamics, including opposition to the EU’s democratic efforts in the neighbourhood. Such an overarching assessment should contribute to innovations in democratisation policies corresponding to the realities on the ground.
Proposals are expected to address some of the following points: To take stock of developments in democracy building or failure in the EU’s neighbourhood countries. Research should draw lessons as regards success factors and barriers (political, economic, social, cultural, etc.) in the different regional, national and supranational contexts. The role of third country actors like the United States of America, China, Russia and their impact on democratisation processes or the entrenchment of authoritarianism should be examined. Similarly, the interplay of security and stability considerations and democratisation support in the EU’s agenda and actions should be analysed. Proposals should also assess the mechanisms the EU uses to support political change, as well as examine the discourses and narratives it employs and the actors it targets. They are expected to collect reliable and comparable data on funding for democracy, human rights, gender equality, the rule of law and good governance support, in order to build an account of the outcomes of a decade’s efforts, and thus facilitate learning and improvement. International cooperation with partners from countries in the EU’s neighbourhood is strongly encouraged.

Projects should contribute to both of the following expected outcomes:
Comparative and historical analysis of the multilevel political impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic crisis, including governance responses.
Recommendations, based on normative and empirical approaches, to enhance the capacity of the EU and other democratic institutions, governments and intergovernmental bodies to build responses to global catastrophes based on international collaboration, solidarity, the rule of law and respect of fundamental values and human rights.
Scope:
The COVID-19 crisis affects our societies in profound and multifaceted ways. Far beyond the public health threat, the crisis causes economic dislocations, social disruptions and information disorder that test political processes and institutions. In particular, certain measures taken by national governments in the context of states of emergency to contain the virus as fast and effectively as possible represent fundamental challenges to democracy, the rule of law and fundamental rights, including women’s rights. In addition, the crisis also opens opportunities for positive change and innovative new solutions that research actions will help to identify and grasp.
Even if allegedly temporary, derogations from fundamental constitutional checks and balances, individual rights and civil liberties might render liberal democracies permeable to illiberal attitudes and mind frames. In this vein, research should examine the impact of the pandemic on populist and extremist discourses and proposals, and assess whether it has bolstered polarisation and the appeal of authoritarianism or whether, on the contrary, it has provided impetus and momentum for an effective uphold of democratic accountability and judicial control.
Moreover, a stocktaking exercise should allow identifying whether the political trend emerging from the crisis is a demand for greater and improved collaboration and concerted action amongst EU Member States and Associated Countries or, on the contrary, an overall “renationalisation” of the EU and international spheres.
Proposals are expected to address the following: Examine the impacts of the different “exceptional or crisis politics”, including the invocation of emergency clauses under human rights law, on the constitutional and democratic polity (rule of law, political institutions, political participation, human rights and freedoms). A comparative and historical analysis, taking into account the varying approaches followed by the different governments, including the digitalisation of political participation and the respect for human rights and freedoms in the digital sphere, is encouraged. Take stock of the reconfiguration of the geopolitical landscape following the responses and policies put forward by the different actors of the international order. Identify and propose changes and reforms required by the global governance in order to enhance the capacity to cope with and react to similar future crises. In particular, examine and propose “circuit-breaker” mechanisms that could isolate systemic risks early on and prevent them from spreading. Build evidence, including based on past crises, on how international cooperation, at both European and global levels, is a vital tool for national governments to overcome contemporary large-scale crises. Propose ways for the EU and the multilateral system to demonstrate that they can complement and lead national governments’ efforts in contexts of security and health threats. In this respect, the impact on the legitimacy of the EU following on its role and actions during the crisis is of particular interest. Study how governmental and societal responses to the pandemic, including the digitalisation of government and society, have affected trust in public authorities and among groups and individuals in society. This includes research on pandemic-related disinformation and mechanisms to cope with. A comparative analysis of the information flow between science, politics and civil society is encouraged. Proposals should actively engage with a range of stakeholders, such as social partners, civil society, citizens, research practitioners, industry and public authorities. International cooperation is encouraged in order to better achieve the expected outcomes.[1]

Increase the shared critical understanding of the potential, opportunities, barriers, accessibility issues and risks of using emerging technologies for teaching and learning, as well considering the framework for the sustainable digitisation of education and learning in the future.
Support education and training systems with research on the adaptation and mainstreaming of the use of digitally enhanced pedagogies, in order to augment and extend learning, while also maintaining its human dimension and social relevance.
Share evidence and good practice on equipping teachers, trainers, educational leaders and learners with the skills necessary for the use of technology in creative, critical, competent and inclusive ways
Analyse the needs for adequate teacher training in relation with new educational technologies.
Scope:
Proposals should support the purposeful and pedagogical use of emerging technologies, including applications of artificial intelligence (AI), virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR) and robotics in education and training, in order to foster 21st century skills such as communication, collaboration, digital literacy, critical as well as design thinking and creativity. This in turn should allow for more personalized and flexible ways of learning, including online and blended delivery. Proposals should also examine the link with big data, learning analytics and artificial intelligence, to efficiently support distance learning. Research should focus on how different learners experience and benefit, or are excluded from, digitally enhanced learning (e.g. male and female students, students of a migrant background, students with disabilities, and/or learning difficulties, gifted and talented students, urban and rural populations, young and adult learners, etc.). Proposals should tackle as well the potential negative effects of using technologies in schools, such as cyber bullying, while also looking at the positive effects of using such technologies to increase students’ learning opportunities. In addition, the research should explore the effects of digital technologies on the learning of basic skills. It should also examine the resilience and the capacity for effective mass-deployment of e-learning capabilities in cases of crises, major emergencies such as the COVID-19 pandemic, disruptive events as well as man-made or natural disasters, which can undermine the human and social dimension of learning. Finally, it should also explore multi-stakeholder involvement and cooperation patterns in this context. The perspectives of educators, parents, and students should inform this analysis.
The action should identify barriers, enablers and framework conditions for successfully embedding emerging technologies in educational practices, including necessary innovation skills for teachers. It should also look at the positive and negative effects of digital technologies on learning, educational outcomes and basic skills. This should be done in sustainable and ecologically responsible ways, addressing accessibility in an inclusive manner, and providing for the gradual move from small-scale projects and pilots to mainstream implementation and adoption. The ethical use of data generated by digital learning platforms and tools should equally be a particular focus. Finally, the proposals should also assess potential vulnerabilities and negative unforeseen consequences, which might arise from the use of new technologies.
Proposals should analyse the shifting role of teachers, trainers and educational leaders in the digital transition affecting education and training as well as their training needs, including digital and leadership skills, required in an emerging society of permanent and quick technological change. The action should address the active involvement of educators in shaping and co-designing education and training technological products and tools. The proposals should also examine the support necessary for Initial Teacher Education institutions for the development of innovative training programmes for pre-service teachers, fostering their future digital competence and confidence.

Develop knowledge on the ongoing and expected changes and disruptions in trade patterns, global value chains and production networks.
Identify innovative ways to maximise the potential and mitigate the adverse social, economic and environmental impacts of changes in global value chains and international trade patterns in European urban and rural areas. Research should take into consideration impacts on employment, job quality, economic growth, income inequalities and on social cohesion and well-being.
Assess the impacts of the coronavirus pandemic and related public health crisis on global value chains, production networks and security of supplies, and their short- and longer-term implications for employment and social resilience in the EU.
Unfold policy scenarios for future value chain developments, production networks and level playing field trade relations, which will ensure security of strategic supplies, strengthen the economic resilience of societies, foster sustainable employment creation in the EU and mitigate the impacts of future trade and value chains disruptions on EU employment.
Produce new, innovative methodologies and ways for assessing and monitoring the level playing field developments in trade and value chains in the EU.
Scope:
Globalization has expanded the value and supply chains and shifted trade patterns and dynamics. On the one hand, the fall of transportation costs, the accelerating digitalisation and the reduction of obstacles to international trade have facilitated the integration of EU companies in global value chains and supported job creation. On the other hand, the profound transformations of global value chains, trade and production networks have raised significant social, economic and environmental challenges, including increasing divergence in productivity, labour market effects in the EU, decent work and working conditions in low-cost production countries slow progress towards resource-efficiency and decarbonisation, lack of security of and access to strategic supplies.
Research should first conceptualise the actual global and sectoral trade patterns, value chains, supply chains and production networks in light of the EU’s long-term policy priorities of social resilience and competitive sustainability. It should then analyse the impacts of different trade patterns, value chains and production networks on the EU value added, labour market, income inequalities, decent work and social cohesion in urban and rural areas, taking into account gender differences. Research should develop a comparative assessment with the main strategic partners and provide innovative, forward-looking policy scenarios with recommendations for future global value chains, trade patterns and trade intensities, which will ensure security of strategic supplies, promote a high level of employment and tackle income inequalities in the EU, while safeguarding job quality and social and territorial cohesion. The policy scenarios should take into consideration analytical approaches, which will improve the economic and environmental performance of supply chains in the EU. The policy scenarios and recommendations should focus on EU, national and sectoral strategies, policy measures and targeted actions aimed at shaping fair, inclusive and sustainable trade patterns, value and supply chains as well as production networks. They should be coherent with the EU long-term policy priorities of social and economic resilience, competitive sustainability and the twin transition (digital and green).
The proposals should take into consideration the impacts of the coronavirus pandemic and the related public health crisis on trade patterns and global value chains as well as the impacts of international trade disruptions, due to the lockdown measures, on added value, EU employment, job quality, income inequality and social cohesion.
Proposals will further develop innovative methodologies for assessing and monitoring, quantitatively and qualitatively, level playing field developments in trade, value chains, supply chains and employment. The innovative methodologies should also cover level playing field developments in key policy areas of taxation, competition and social policies.
The research will deploy multi-disciplinary methodologies and target multi-dimensional aspects, developing cross-sectoral and forward-looking responses, involving external stakeholders and experts, including European social partners, regional and national authorities and international trade, labour market and social policy experts.

Proposals are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:
Take stock, identify weaknesses, and advance our knowledge on contemporary China’s social, cultural, political, and economic characteristics, on the impact of its foreign policy, and on its compliance with international obligations/laws/norms (or lack thereof). Scrutinize new global narratives and how these compare and interact with European interests and values and identify possible areas of mutually beneficial cooperation
Incrementally develop and network independent European knowledge and expertise on Contemporary China in order to mainstream knowledge and enhance the European capacity to bring forward coherent and fact-based policy-making. This should be done by taking into account and building upon existing knowledge and relevant networks already being developed and/or strengthened at the level of Member States in order to increase knowledge sharing across Europe, create new synergies between knowledge nodes, and complement existing knowledge enhancing strategies.
Scope:
Europe aims for a realistic, assertive and multi-faceted approach to China (Joint Communication “EU-China – A Strategic Outlook”, 2019). China and the EU are two of the three largest economies and traders in the world and in the last few decades, China’s economic and political dimensions have grown with unprecedented scale and speed. Recent developments within the international system including, the creation of new global frameworks and multilateral institutions such as the Belt and Road Initiative, the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank or the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, and China’s growing presence in key international institutions, have unveiled a newfound Chinese pro-activeness in the international sphere. Today China is a key global actor and a leading scientific and technological power. This results in an increase in bilateral and multilateral engagements on a vast variety of issues such as trade, research/technology, sustainable development, climate change, foreign direct investment, and human rights. At the same time, this rise has exposed the weakness Europe faces in its capacity to better understand China in its various specificities, complexities, and goals and respond to its rapid evolution and new policy directions. As China becomes ever more prevalent in a wide array of policy areas, upgrading, supporting, connecting, and mainstreaming knowledge on the topic in Europe has become a necessity for policy-makers, stakeholders, and civil society at large in order to better navigate strategic opportunities and challenges with foresight instead of reacting with delay. Because of China’s increasing relevance, Europe needs to get to know and understand it on its own terms: not through the lens of other external sources but from its own European perspective. The upgrade needs to be based on independent European analysis grounded in facts and insights from science and research carried out in academia and by independent think thanks as well as surveys and trend analysis on experiences of stakeholders engaged in a number of areas. At the intersection of science, economics and foreign affairs, Europe should support an independent understanding of China and its overall defining social, economic, and political characteristics.
Projects are expected to address the following: further deepen European independent knowledge/understanding of China’s social, cultural, political, and economic characteristics, of the impact of its foreign policy, and of its compliance with international obligations/laws/norms (or lack thereof). Analyse new global narratives and study how these compare and interact with European interests and values, while acknowledging and reflecting Europe’s diversity. Enhance the visibility of our independent expertise and mainstream knowledge on China to increase its appeal in learning/research institutions among students. Stimulate and support the creation of independent knowledge on contemporary China to increase the level of “knowledge autonomy/independence” through the creation of new connections and synergies between intra-European China knowledge nodes from across all relevant organizations and joint research projects.

Advanced disaster / crisis simulations and impact assessments supporting decision-making processes based on best available knowledge, adaptive strategies and methodologies, including accurate exposure data and adequate vulnerability assessments, quantitative hazard information with comparable metrics across different risks (especially addressing multi-hazard situations), including disaster loss data and qualitative information issued from historical testimonies and case studies.
Risk and resilience assessment solutions, studies and outputs in support of long-term multi-hazard management strategies (e.g. climate adaptation, disaster risk reduction and prevention and mitigation strategies) with a focus on vulnerable regions prone to multiple hazard occurrences, involving interdisciplinary teams in different scientific and technological fields (such as geology, climate, man-made hazards, critical infrastructures and assets, history, health sciences, economics and social sciences). This requires novel interdisciplinary risk approaches to assessing human-hazard interactions, and reaching the most vulnerable segments of the community.
Advanced data management, information update and forecast / early warning systems (including via satellite and in-situ observation) in support of evolving public understanding and decision-making needs in the field of multi-hazard preparedness policy and planning, taking into account data uncertainties and including the determination of baseline scenarios and corresponding risk thresholds, as well as data potentially available (e.g. from surveys, earth observations, historic databases, academic and business/private sector repositories, climate projections, etc.) and near-real-time impact simulations combined with data-farming approaches.
Communication and dissemination platforms supporting an increased dialogue and cooperation between scientific, technological, practitioners, policy-makers, private sector (e.g. insurers), NGOs, citizens and community-based organisations for sharing and building-up the knowledge of hazards and related risks for a comprehensive awareness (and preparedness) of the risk at all levels (risk memory and implementation of lessons learnt into policy actions), taking into account various uncertainties that may affect decision-making.
Scope:
The awareness of multiple hazards and the understanding and the assessment of risks and their consequences is a critical and fundamental step towards the development of local, national and international policies and strategies within all phases of the disaster risk management cycle, in particular preparedness. The availability of reliable scientific data and information (including historical occurrences and climate projections) to anticipate future disaster events or crisis situations, considering uncertainties inherent to natural systems characterization, and effectively support decision-making processes at all levels represents a global challenge for both the research community and governance institutions.
Actions at national/local and global/regional levels rely on knowledge of risks in all its dimension and changeable nature. A strengthened understanding of risks by the population (and decision-makers) is needed, based on both records of past events and forecasts and projections (with quantified uncertainties) that reflect consideration of evolving trends and dynamics over time and space. This is particularly acute in the case of multi-hazard risks, i.e. occurrences of several disasters either in cascade or at once. Moreover, the work needs to be complemented with improved knowledge on how risk awareness and actions are influenced and shaped by diverse aspects such as past events, cultures and traditions.
The understanding of multiple disaster risks (and related awareness) relies on knowledge gained about historical data and information about past events and related lessons learned as well as the ability to forecast and assess future risks under uncertainty (including impacts of pandemics, as well as global change, including climate trends and earth system and environment dynamics). These complex interactions between human decisions and multiple hazards require novel risk assessment approaches such as agent-based modelling and systems dynamics methods. This will result in improved preparedness actions built upon these analyses (e.g. defining evacuation routes, responsiveness of health services, etc.). Social media also plays a role in disaster analytics. For example, an increasing number of location-based social network services can provide time-stamped, geo-located data that opens new opportunities and solutions to a wide range of challenges by analysing the extracted public behaviour responses from social media before, during and after disaster events. When using social media data, the design for data collection and analysis has to respect fundamental rights, privacy and data protection and analyses have to take related societal effects in online and offline environments into account as well as possible disinformation and fake news. Also, risk awareness, understanding and preparedness are unequally distributed along a wide range of variables (socio-economic, cultural, regional etc.) that may generate drawbacks and conflicting issues with respect to groups' vulnerability.
This topic requires the effective contribution of SSH disciplines and the involvement of SSH experts, institutions as well as the inclusion of relevant SSH expertise, in order to produce meaningful and significant effects enhancing the societal impact of the related research activities. The involvement of citizens, civil society and other societal stakeholders in co-design and co-creation should be promoted. In order to achieve the expected outcomes, international cooperation is encouraged.
Where possible and relevant, synergy-building and clustering initiatives with successful proposals in the same area should be considered, including the organisation of international conferences in close coordination with the Community for European Research and Innovation for Security (CERIS) activities and/or other international events.

Improved dialogue and cooperation among scientific and technical communities, stakeholders, policy-makers and local communities in the field of extreme climate events and associated events (e.g. forest fires, droughts, floods, heatwaves and storms) and disaster risk reduction.
Enhanced community engagement for prevention, preparedness, response, recovery and learning to extreme climate events by strengthening knowledge and involvement of volunteers linked to recognised organisations into the planning, design and implementation of prevention, including building with nature, preparedness and emergency response activities.
Strengthening of disaster risk reduction and resilience building through innovative use of media means, namely by examining the potential of new communication tools and apps for better preparedness and response.
Overview of existing knowledge, tools and development of new tools (innovative data collection, satellite data, data harmonisation, artificial-intelligence tools, algorithms, sensors and decision-aid approaches) for early warning, response and resilience / adaptation to be demonstrated in the framework of real-case scenarios designed for training addressed to first and second responders, (national, regional, local) authorities and populations. The overview should document how legal and ethical rules of operation as well as fundamental rights such as privacy and protection of personal data are taken into account.
Based on the demonstrations, development of new governance strategies and robust decision-support methodologies for integrated risk reduction and improved adaptation to climate extreme events.
Improved understanding of enablers and barriers to multi-risk governance frameworks and multi-risk thinking, by involving interdisciplinary teams in different fields, particularly the social and behavioural sciences.

Identification of production/livelihood practices (goods, services, activities etc.) at community and national level that contribute to increased local/global climate risks, and explore how these can be adapted so that they are both economically and environmentally sustainable.
Scope:
In contemporary society, the capacity of communities and governments to manage expected and/or unexpected extreme climate events depends heavily on effective governance throughout the entire Disaster Risk Management cycle. This covers operational mechanisms ranging from short-term actions (e.g. early warning and forecast-based actions) to long-term adaptation strategies and resilience building, including nature-based solutions. A coherent integration between Disaster Risk Reduction, Climate Adaptation policies and Sustainable Development Goals as fostered by the European Green Deal and major UN initiatives should result in a comprehensive resilience framework, while improving synergies and coherence among the institutions and international agencies involved.
The effective implementation of global and European risk governance and policies to enable integrated disaster risk reduction for extreme climate events requires a collaborative involvement in risk assessment and information sharing across involved institutions, including the civil and private sector and the population.
Cross-regional, cross-border and cross-sector agreements covering all phases of Disaster Risk Management can improve the knowledge about extreme climate events such as forest fires, droughts, floods, heatwaves, storms and storm surges. In addition, improving effective prevention, preparedness and response rely upon specific national or local expertise and experience. It is important to overcome silos between technical and political authorities at all levels and advocate integration among involved actors. Multi-risk governance frameworks related to climate extremes, shifting from single to multi-risk thinking in governmental agencies, represents the key challenge for the future, considering how measures to improve the resilience of the built environment and communities may provide effective solutions to strengthen adaptation measures.
Creating an overview of existing knowledge, integrating tools and developing new ones for resilience and emergency management should include careful planning for interoperability amongst many actors. It is important that solutions pay attention to societal side-effects of integrating data about emergencies, for instance Apps, where persons concerned tend to share more willingly, but do not reflect consequences of that. Thus, the development of data management tools for emergencies need to respect fundamental rights, data protection and avoid function creep.
This topic requires the effective contribution of SSH disciplines and the involvement of SSH experts, institutions as well as the inclusion of relevant SSH expertise, in order to produce meaningful and significant effects enhancing the societal impact of the related research activities.

Projects’ results are expected to contribute to some of the following outcomes:
Innovative exposure and vulnerability analysis methods, including those that take a systemic perspective by integrating sectoral expertise (e.g. social science, human health, cultural heritage, environment and biodiversity, public financial management and key economic sectors) and identifying key vulnerable groups and assets.
Maximising usability through a service-oriented approach, including through the optimisation and tailoring recommended practices, scientific models and scenarios for the intended users to support technical policy improvements and implementation of actions.
Enhanced exploitation of monitoring data and satellite/remote sensing information as well as artificial intelligence to improve high-level assessment from international to local levels, identifying the major sources of uncertainty in hazard assessment and ways to reduce them.
Evaluation of existing disaster risk and resilience assessment and scenarios (at national and local levels), taking into account historical / geological data, monitoring, risk and forecasting data, and based on the evaluation, serious games, modelling of future scenarios accounting for current and future impacts of diverse extreme events and disasters.
Scope:
The assessment of disaster risks requires different types of actions ranging from soft measures to technologies. Simulation-based risk and impact assessments represent an effective approach to make science understandable to decision makers and streamline national to local mitigation/adaptation actions. This is especially the case if they are integrated with evaluation tools for cost-benefit/effectiveness and multi-criteria analyses, data-farming experiments, serious games, and are tailored to meet end-user’s needs, to assess the effectiveness of alternative options in different phases of the Disaster Risk Management cycle.
Specific risk assessments should be decision- or demand-driven and informed by scientific evidence, and there is a clear need to translate the results to ensure they are relevant, usable, legitimate and credible from the perspectives of the users. Co-design, co-development, co-dissemination and co-evaluation engaging the intended end users represent in this sense key features of improved risk, resilience and impact assessments.
In a first place, the acquisition of data is an essential feature and this requires innovative solutions for faster risk assessment and reduction. This includes the identification of precursors for different types of threats, supporting the design or improvement of risk-targeted monitoring programmes. In addition, risk assessments themselves are primarily designed to predict the likelihood of a specific event, whereas what is of primary concern is the impact of that event on society, infrastructure, governance, etc. Numerous experiences gathered in the natural hazards area showed that an enhanced assessment of risks and scenario building may be improved by taking into account reliable data (both quantitative and qualitative) and historical occurrences, when available, including disaster loss data (studies of past events in particular low-probability / long-time recurrence events). This includes for example a higher completeness of the historical-geological records of volcanic eruptions, major earthquakes, tsunamis etc.
In the case of extreme climate events such as storms and related storm surges, or health crises (outbreaks, pandemics) the analysis should draw on the outputs of state-of-the-art climate projections, including by taking into account the uncertainties brought on by climate change and our state of knowledge of the key processes underpinning the functioning of the Earth system.In cases where there are not be enough historical data and a high level of uncertainty, assessments and decision making will have to rely on qualitative data.
The action should take into account disaster loss databases and risk data repositories in Member States and relevant hubs. This topic requires the effective contribution of SSH disciplines and the involvement of SSH experts, institutions as well as the inclusion of relevant SSH expertise, in order to produce meaningful and significant effects enhancing the societal impact of the related research activities. In order to achieve the expected outcomes, international cooperation is encouraged.
Where possible and relevant, synergy-building and clustering initiatives with successful proposals in the same area should be considered, including the organisation of international conferences in close coordination with the Community for European Research and Innovation for Security (CERIS) activities and/or other international events.

","single-stage
Deadline date","ExpectedOutcome:
Projects are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:
Advanced self-healing disaster recovery and effective business continuity in critical sectors (e.g. energy, transportation, health);
Enhanced mechanisms for exchange of information among relevant players;
Better disaster preparedness against possible disruptions, attacks and cascading effects;
Better business continuity covering two or more sectors.
The proposal should provide appropriate indicators to measure its progress and specific impact.
Scope:
This action aims at developing new methodologies, services and tools for accelerating the self-recovery and possible adaptation of the infrastructures and supply chains after an attack. In line with the NIS Directive the focus should be on critical sectors (e.g. energy, transportation, health) as well as telecommunication networks. The proposal should go beyond the state-of-the-art in developing and validating AI-based self-healing, effective business continuity and disaster recovery in real-world scenarios covering two or more business sectors and supporting their private and public actors.
Cyber threat intelligence and situational awareness need to be developed from the current research level towards strategic considerations, and down to real-time events. This requires collaboration and data sharing between different security actors and should be based on a collection of heterogeneous data, models and predictions for multi-level security. Cyber incidents are likely to require the efforts from a heterogeneous network of organisations or a network of business units inside a single organisation, both when it comes to prevention, detection and response. The solutions (technologies, methods, tools, procedures, practices and/or strategies including escalation and de-escalation) developed must satisfy the needs of the end-users and support daily tasks, efficient and effective operations and ensure business continuity. Thus, an organisational perspective should be included. Furthermore, the methods for exchanging information and the actors considered should build, whenever possible, on the current practices in line with the NIS Directive.
The proposed solutions should include dynamic execution of disruption recovery and business continuity processes. They should dynamically extract all relevant digital evidence, information and digital traces, provide real-time personalised technical assistance, share information and real-time alerts with relevant stakeholders.
Human factors (e.g. behavioural, psychological, physical, cultural and gender) need to be considered appropriately in all aspects of the proposed solution. Proposals should build on existing research and projects[1], clearly identify the state-of-the-art and explain the strengths of the new solution in the context of the chosen sectors.
Research should address the risks and impact of a cyber-incident on the business itself, using appropriate KPIs, but also possible cascading effects of cyber incidents for critical infrastructure (including potential cross-sectoral and cross-border impacts) and society overall.
The research should include a proof of concept in order to validate the claimed progress and show the benefits in an adequate testing environment involving real end-users. End-users should be involved in all steps of the cycle from design to development and testing. Participation of SMEs is encouraged. This topic requires the effective contribution of SSH disciplines and the involvement of SSH experts, institutions as well as the inclusion of relevant SSH expertise, in order to produce meaningful and significant effects enhancing the societal impact of the related research and innovation activities.

","single-stage
Deadline date","ExpectedOutcome:
Proposal results are expected to contribute to at least one of the following expected outcomes:
Innovative AI, data and robotics solutions for resource optimisation and minimisation of waste in any type of sector (from agri-food, to energy, utilities, transport, production, etc.), reduction of energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions including exploitation of all data and information sources contributing to optimising applications for a greener planet. This includes among others contribution to enterprises’ sustainability programs in the context of their CSR (Corporate Social Responsibility) strategies to reduce their ecological footprint, cutting costs and contributing to social welfare at the same time
Optimised AI, data and robotics (including modular and adaptive solutions) to maximise contribution to the Green Deal in various applications such as environmental and waste management, including for instance waste clean-up (e.g. plastic collection, sorting), or in the circular economy value chain.
Advanced physical intelligence and physical performance of robotics solutions in diverse harsh environments serving the Green Deal.
Scope:
Proposals are expected to integrate and optimise AI, data and robotics solutions in order to demonstrate, by addressing use-cases scenarios in actual or highly realistic operating environments, how they can directly contribute to the Green Deal. The proposed methodology should be supported by industry or service relevant KPIs, making the case for the added value of such technologies, and demonstrating scalability, and deployment potential. Technology performance as well as added value to the application field should be demonstrated by qualitative and quantitative KPIs, demonstrators, benchmarking and progress monitoring. The environmental impacts of the proposed solutions should also be taken into account when making the case for the added value of the technology for the environment.
While the proposals must be application driven, involving problem owners to define needs and validate the proposed solutions, the focus is on optimising enabling AI, data and robotics technologies to maximise the benefit they bring in such applications. Proposals should adopt a concrete problem solving approach, exploiting and optimising the most suitable technologies and solutions at hand. The focus should be on real-world scenarios, which can benefit in short to mid-term from the technology and solutions and demonstrate substantial impact on the Green Deal, while taking into account the maturity of the technologies to solve the problems at hand.
Deep involvement of all relevant stakeholders (including SMEs), from technology providers to user industry, social partners, and relevant experts in operational and environmental impact assessment, will be essential. Special attention will be given to including users of diverse age, gender and background.
All proposals should incorporate training programs for non-expert users of AI, data and robotics systems, who are domain experts and need to know basic AI, data, robotics concepts, including the basics concepts of Trustworthy and ethical AI.
To reach their objectives, all proposals are expected to exploit synergies between at least two of the three components: AI, Data and Robotics and forge strong cooperation between to corresponding practitioners.
Proposals can involve either robotics-only solutions (for instance demonstrating robotics solutions in harsh environments), or a mix of robotics and non-robotics components (for instance in applications such as waste management, where a combination of robotics for waste segregation and data and sensor driven AI for process optimisation) or only include non-robotics AI and Data (for instance in energy optimisation, from production sites, through the network, and then end-user sites, with IoT components). All selected proposals are expected to include demonstrators at TRL 6 or above. At least half of the selected proposals will have to have a major robotics demonstrator; therefore, proposals should clearly specify their robotics demonstrator, if they chose to have one.
Proposals should clearly identify the expected outcome it will focus on.
Two types of proposals are expected:
Focused projects (EU contribution around EUR 3.00 million), involving the user industry and technology provider(s),
Larger projects (EU contribution around EUR 5.00 million), where a number of companies in a given application sector will identify in the proposal common challenges and use-cases, and organise competitive calls for AI, data and robotics solution providers to address such challenges. Competitive calls will be open to all types of companies, but only SMEs and Start-ups[1] will receive financial support to third parties, with a maximum of EUR 200 000 per third party[2] and 70% funding (100% for start-ups). At least 40% of the requested amount should be dedicated to financial support to third parties. The consortium will provide technical support with expertise in engineering integration, testing and validation to support the selected SMEs and start-ups acting as technology providers to demonstrate the added value of their solutions to address the challenges of the use-cases. Maximum one type of third party project will be funded per expected outcome[3].
In all proposals, user industries are expected to play a major role in the requirement and validation phases.
Besides financial support, these SMEs and start-ups successfully demonstrating the potential of their solutions, must receive support from business experts, provided by the action, to further develop their business and develop their market reach, and maximise their business opportunities.
When possible, proposals should build on and reuse public results from relevant previous funded actions. Proposals should make use of connections to the Digital Innovation Hub networks, particularly those in Robotics, Data and AI. Full use should be made of the common resources available in the AI-on-Demand platform[4], Digital Industrial Platform for Robotics[5], data platforms[6] and, if necessary other relevant digital resource platforms. Communicable results from selected proposals should be delivered to the most relevant of these platforms in order to enhance the European AI, Data and Robotics ecosystem through the sharing of results and best practice.
If proposals use satellite-based earth observation, positioning, navigation and/or related timing services and data, they have to prioritise Copernicus and/or Galileo/EGNOS over equivalent competing solutions offering the same services/data.
All proposals are expected to allocate tasks to cohesion activities with the co-programmed partnership on AI, Data and Robotics and funded actions related to this partnership, including the CSA HORIZON-CL4-2021-HUMAN-01-02. Where relevant, synergies with other European partnerships and Horizon Europe Clusters (Cluster 4 and Cluster 6 in particular) are encouraged.

Proposal results are expected to contribute to the following expected outcome:
New generation of AI-Powered Robotics: Enabling robots to have more profound impacts than they currently have, in powering them with a deeper kind of AI, endowing them with a better perception and understanding of the world (up to semantic and explainable representations), This would allow the next generation of autonomous robots, with increased capabilities to work without/with limited supervision, as well as the next generation of interactive robots, with greatly improved intuitive, safe and efficient cognitive, social and physical capabilities, to assist humans.
In addition, depending on the focus of the proposal, the results are expected to contribute to at least one of the following expected outcomes
Smarter robots with improved capabilities, functionalities (including complex functionalities such as manipulation of delicate, irregular, dynamic or deformable objects, navigation in un-controlled and variable or challenging and harsh environments, and continuous human-physical interactions) and an increased level of autonomy over the current state of the art, necessary to address real-world problems, while ensuring safety and reliability.
Smooth and trustworthy (including safety and reliability) human-robot collaboration through advanced reactivity and mutual understanding, and human-centric automated adaptation of robots in human-robot interactions.
Scope:
Proposals are expected to develop technologies and systems that significantly enhance the cognitive ability of robots from the current state of the art to achieve greater levels of interaction and autonomy. Proposals will address as appropriate the following:
Develop enabling technologies, both new and existing, that extend the current state of the art in robotics perception, cognition, interaction and action as well as develop novel or advanced tools for the design and configuration of robots and robot systems that speed up the process of integration thereby reducing the time taken to deploy robot solutions. To do so by addressing the modularity and composability of solutions both in the operational context of a wide range of action and interaction use cases.
There is also a need to address concepts such as trustworthiness, privacy, security and ethics already at the technology design phase.
Develop lifelong autonomous robotics able to tackle unknown situations and adapt in the long term in pushing the state of the art of AI-based robots that combine monitoring, learning, planning and acting in order to evolve in difficult environments over long period of time. Support from simulation tools could be considered, as appropriate.
Increase robot acceptance by handling adequately both human and robotic actions, with human-centric, advanced behavioural and elaborated planning models, and adopting multidisciplinary approaches including SSH[1], as well as end-user involvement in the design of solutions addressing human factors and interaction. Gender and intersectionality dimension[2] analysis should be a part of the proposals, where relevant.
Push the limits of robotics interaction, adopting an interdisciplinary approach to integrate methods and techniques that allow the machines to engage in physical interactions with people or the environment, safely and intelligently, through specific enabling technologies: intuitiveness and responsive human-robot interfaces; integration of robot perception with natural and artificial intelligence; ability to physically, stably, dependably and safely interact with the environment, including users and surrounding people; development of advanced control tools fully integrating the human in the loop when performing a task; development of advanced control tools for dexterous and safe manipulation, assistance, and locomotion in diverse environments (ground, air, water, space, in-vivo and including safety critical and hazardous environments that are corrosive, explosive, nuclear or at extremes of pressure or temperature) and in general for improved performance of robots; energy autonomy and resilience to highly limited and imperfect communication networks in on-field applications.
Two types of proposals are expected, either focusing on higher level of autonomy, expecting less reliance on human supervision, or focusing on human-machine collaboration.
In each case, improvement in the level of robotics cognition should be demonstrated through at least three real-world scenarios (including measurements of functional performance), showing also the potential added value of such improvement in such use-cases scenarios. Scientific and technological progress should be demonstrated by qualitative and quantitative KPIs, demonstrators, benchmarking and progress monitoring. Activities are expected to achieve TRL 4-5 by the end of the project
The first type of proposals will further develop the level of autonomy in building on the latest developments in areas such as advanced perception, smart sensors, intelligent action and interaction, reasoning and learning, increased interpretation and understanding of the complex real-world environments (possibly involving human actions), anticipation of the effect of actions, adaptation and re-planning, graceful degradation, safety and security, etc. They will, as appropriate, further develop such components, and integrate them in an advanced robotics system, consider the balance of on-board vs off-board processes and the access and utilisation of external data and cloud resources to guide tasks and missions by adding external knowledge to internal reasoning and decision-making processes.
The second type of proposals will further develop and integrate physical human-robot interaction, verbal/non-verbal communication as well as robot-environment/object interaction, embedding, as appropiate, safety, mutual understanding perception and interpretation of human actions, interaction situated in complex real-world environments and related motivations and social structures, joint goals, shared and sliding autonomy, ethical human-centric behaviour by understanding of physiological responses and emotions, etc. to reach truly smooth human-robot collaboration. This should as well integrate advanced control developments, and further develop them as necessary to guarantee the necessary speed for the required reactivity, ensuring natural, safe and smooth interactions with humans. Appropriate use should be made of data and knowledge accumulation from internal and external sources in order to guide reasoning and decision-making and the inclusion of explainability/transparency mechanisms[3] appropriate to the use case. Such proposals should adopt a multidisciplinary approach and involve the necessary expertise in SSH[1], in particular in ethics and human-centric design to enhance trust and acceptability.
When possible proposals should build on and reuse public results from relevant previous funded actions. Proposals should make use of connections to the Digital Innovation Hub networks, particularly those in Robotics, Data and AI. Full use should be made of the common resources available in the AI-on-Demand platform[5], Digital Industrial Platform for Robotics[6], data platforms[7] and, if necessary other relevant digital resource platforms. Communicable results from projects should be delivered to the most relevant of these platforms so as to enhance the European AI, Data and Robotics ecosystem through the sharing of results and best practice.
All proposals should also take into consideration trustworthy AI principles[8] including respect of human dignity and agency, as appropriate, given the technology focus.

Proposal results are expected to contribute to all the following expected outcomes:
Scientific and technology advances in the major robotics challenges hampering its deployment
A strong and tightly networked European research community in robotics, making it a world-class powerhouse for robotics excellence.
Scope:
To ensure European open strategic autonomy in robotics, with huge potential socio-economic impact, it is essential to reinforce and build on Europe’s assets, including its world-class research community. In order to stay at the forefront of technological developments, it is essential that researchers collaborate, share ideas and research outcomes. A strongly networked community focused on excellence will be better at addressing the major robotics challenges that block the domain’s further development and deployment.
As stated in the communication from the European Commission on Artificial Intelligence for Europe[1] and the coordinated action plan between the European Commission and the Member States and Associated Countries[2], while Europe has undeniable strengths with its many leading research centres, efforts are scattered. Therefore, joining forces will be crucial to international competitiveness. Europe must scale up existing research capacities and reach a critical mass through tighter networks of European robotics excellence centres. Proposals should develop mechanisms to reinforce and network excellence centres in AI-powered robotics[3], bringing the best scientists from academia and industry to join forces in addressing the major robotics challenges hampering its deployment, and to reinforce excellence in robotics throughout Europe via a network of collaboration that focuses research excellence on future industrial needs.
Such networks are expected to mobilise leading researchers to collaborate on key robotics topics, to reach critical mass and increase the impact of the funding in progressing faster in joined efforts rather than working in isolation, with fragmented and duplicated efforts.
Composition of the Network:
Proposals should be driven by leading figures in robotics from major excellent robotics research centres, and industries, and bringing the best scientists distributed all over Europe, including also from promising research labs. They will bring on board the necessary level of expertise and variety of disciplines and profiles to achieve their objectives.
Industrial participation will be ensured through inclusion of industrial organisations with research teams from multiple sectors that can bring into the network the expertise to identify important technological limitations hampering deployment in industry.
Where relevant, representatives of civil society (e.g. social partners, citizen’s committees) bring in the ideas and needs of consumers/users and society, in order to obtain R&I results that are of practical relevance not only for industry/business but also for society.
Activities of the Network:
In order to structure the activities, the proposals will focus on important scientific or technological challenges with industrial relevance and where Europe will make a difference, either in building on strengths, or strengthening knowledge to fill gaps critical for Europe.
Based on these challenges, the proposals will develop and implement common research agendas. The main vision and roadmap with targets within the projects, as well as methodology to implement and monitor progress will have to be specified in the proposal and can be further developed during the project.
Progress will be demonstrated in the context of use-cases, also helping to foster industry-academia collaboration
Strong links will be developed among the members of the network, notably through collaborative projects, exchange programmes, workshops, or other mechanisms to be defined by the consortia.
Proposals should develop mechanisms to foster excellence, to increase efficiency of collaboration, and to develop a vibrant Robotics network across Europe.
The network will disseminate the latest and most advanced knowledge to all the academic and industrial Robotics laboratories in Europe and involve them in collaborative projects/exchange programmes. (This could involve projects defined initially or via financial support to third parties, for maximum 20% of the requested EU contribution, with a maximum of 60k€ per third party[4]).
The network will develop strong interactions with industry, and where relevant, with trade unions, and civil society (inside the consortium and beyond), in view of triggering new scientific questions and fostering take-up of scientific advances.
The network will develop collaboration with relevant Digital innovation Hubs, to disseminate knowledge and tools, understand their needs, and extend the industry-academia-civil society collaboration.
The network should also foster innovation and include mechanisms to exploit new ideas coming out of the network’s work (for instance via incubators).
Proposals should define mechanisms to become a virtual centre of excellence, offering access to knowledge and serve as a reference in robotics, including activities to ensure high visibility, usability and accessibility.
The proposals should
Include mechanisms to spread the latest and most advanced knowledge to all the robotics-labs in Europe
Develop synergies and cross-fertilization between industry, civil society, and academia
Ensure that the network becomes a common resource and shared facility, as a virtual laboratory offering access to knowledge and expertise and a magnet for talents.
Establish high visibility and accessibility, creating an easy entry point to robotics excellence in Europe where it is possible to access cutting edge ideas, research and expertise.
Include sustainable access to the required resources and infrastructure to support R&D activities of the action, such as robotics equipment, support staff and engineers, and capacity to develop experiments that address the major future robotics challenges.
Proposals should define a number of major scientific and application challenges it will focus on and which will mobilise the community to join forces across Europe in addressing them. Continuous evaluation and demonstration of progress towards solving the targeted challenges will motivate the entire network and support publications and scientific career developments (providing reference benchmarks to publish comparative results, using the reference data, scenarios, etc.), and also showcase the technology in application contexts, to attract more user industries and eventually foster take-up and adoption of the technology. Scientific and technological progress will be monitored through qualitative and quantitative KPIs (including industry and service relevant KPIs), demonstrators, benchmarking and progress monitoring processes.
Activities are expected to achieve TRL 4-5 by the end of the project.
To address limitations of the use of robots due to human factors, an interdisciplinary approach involving both technical and SSH[5] researchers is encouraged to address issues such as interaction design, human factors, acceptability, non-discrimination and biases and trustworthiness, taking into account gender and intersectionality[6] aspects, as appropriate. Indeed, human-centred approaches in combination with multi-stakeholder co-design activities can contribute to sustainable development of new enabling technologies. Putting people at the forefront is expected to generate novel transformation pathways, which can remedy existing technology in novel ways, and propose feedback loop systems that engage human users in developing new sociotechnical learning situations and tools. Further, agile sociotechnical learning designs can remedy e.g. less efficient technologies, by emphasizing human aspects of technologies in any sector (industry, healthcare, smart homes, etc.). Where appropriate, special attention will be given to including users of diverse age, gender and background.
The proposals are expected to include mechanisms to share resources, knowledge, tools, modules, software, results, expertise, and make equipment/infrastructure available to scientists to optimise the scientific and technological progress. To that end, tools such as the AI-on-demand platform[7] and Digital Industrial Platform for Robotics[8] should also be exploited, enhanced and further developed by the network, to support the networking, quality assessment, benchmarking and sharing of resources, maximising re-use and up-take of results. Openness and interoperability of components are encouraged to develop synergies and cross-fertilization between different approaches and solutions (e.g. through modularity of components or open interfaces).
The proposals are also expected to include collaboration mechanisms among the best robotics teams, but also mechanisms to bring all European robotics teams to the highest level of excellence.
Proposals are expected to develop synergies:
With other Networks of excellence centres in AI funded in H2020 or Horizon Europe, with a view of, all together, create vibrant European network of AI excellence centres. To that end, the activities should integrate with and complement the activities of the H2020-ICT-48 projects. The proposals are expected to dedicate tasks to ensure this coherence.
With relevant activities in AI, Data and Robotics, primarily in destinations 3, 4 and 6, but also in other destinations and clusters, and share or exploit results where appropriate.
All proposals are expected to allocate tasks to cohesion activities with the PPP on AI, Data and Robotics and funded actions related to this partnership, including the CSA HORIZON-CL4-2021-HUMAN-01-02. Where relevant, synergies with other PPPs are encouraged.

","single-stage
Deadline date","ExpectedOutcome:
Proposal results are expected to contribute to at least one of the following expected outcomes:
A new human-centred paradigm to keep people away from unsafe and unhealthy jobs via collaborative embodied (physical) AI, engaging and empowering end-users and workers, regardless of their gender, age or background.
Human-centric AI supporting professionals in trustworthy hybrid decision-making, and optimising their tasks
Scope:
Proposals are expected to demonstrate how AI, data, robotics and automation solutions can support workers in their daily tasks, improving working conditions (both physical and social) and work performance/efficiency, while considering safety, security and resilience, as appropriate. The added value to the application field should be demonstrated by qualitative and quantitative industry/production or service relevant KPIs, demonstrators at TRL6-7, benchmarking and progress monitoring processes.
The involvement of the application sector stakeholders, including social partners, workers, managers and decision makers must be a key driver in the proposals, not only to identify the needs and the application scenarios, but to be involved in the co-creation and testing and uptake of the solutions and providing feedback to adapt the solutions to optimise the impact on working conditions and performances.
The selection of the application sector should prioritise sectors and use-cases where the technology can demonstrate maximum impact and added value.
While the focus is on technology, a human-centred approach will be key, with involvement of the workers, professionals, (front-line operators and managers) and other relevant experts, such as experts in human-centred design. They will closely collaborate with the technology providers and integrators. Engagement with SSH[1] expertise is also needed to improve interaction design and to provide expertise on trustworthiness and acceptability by workers, as well as ethical perspective of human-machine collaboration. Gender and intersectionality dimension[2] analysis should be a part of the proposals, where relevant.
Each proposal will focus on one of the two following use-cases:
Collaborative embodied AI (robotics system), empowering end-users and workers keeping them away from unsafe and unhealthy jobs: the focus will be on demonstrating improved working conditions (health/safety/level of stress, etc.), and worker trust and acceptance. The assistance should also take into account other factors less related with physical assistance like stress level. Meaningful human oversight of autonomy should be addressed.
AI and data supporting professionals in trustworthy hybrid decision-making and supporting workers to optimise and facilitate their tasks; the focus will be on demonstrating how AI and data can improve the effectiveness and efficiency as well as management of trade-offs within the decision-making, building on the human and machine complementarities, exploiting the best capability of both for a better outcome. Meaningful human oversight of decision outcomes and explainability should be addressed. Specific effort should be made to develop re-usable decision-support systems or modules.
All proposals should exploit the latest results in AI, data and robotics, as well as multimodal interaction technologies, User interface experience, for natural and seamless interaction between the human and the technology/sources of information, including Augmented/Virtual Reality when appropriate.
Proposals should incorporate skills developments activities or/and connect with existing skills activities in that domain, as appropriate.
Proposals should clearly identify which of the two use-cases listed above they will focus on.
Two types of proposals are expected:
Focused projects (EU contribution around EUR 3.00 million), involving the user industry and technology provider(s),
Larger projects (EU contribution around EUR 5.00), where a number of companies in a given application sector will identify in the proposal common challenges and use-cases, and organise competitive calls for AI, data and robotics solution providers to address such challenges. Competitive calls will be open to all types of companies, but only SMEs and Start-ups[3] will receive financial support to third parties, with a maximum of EUR 200 000 per third party[4] and 70% funding (100% for start-ups). At least 40% of the requested amount should be dedicated to financial support to third parties. The consortium will provide technical support with expertise in engineering integration, testing and validation to support the selected SMEs and start-ups acting as technology providers to demonstrate the added value of their solutions to address the challenges of the use-cases. Maximum one type of third party project will be funded per use-case.
In all proposals, user industries are expected to play a major role in the requirement and validation phases.
Besides financial support, these SMEs and start-ups successfully demonstrating the potential of their solutions, must receive support from business experts, provided by the action, to further develop their business and develop their market reach, and maximise their business opportunities.
When possible, proposals should build on and reuse public results from relevant previous funded actions. Proposals should make use of connections to the Digital Innovation Hub networks, particularly those in Robotics, Data and AI. Full use should be made of the common resources available in the AI-on-Demand platform[5], Digital Industrial Platform for Robotics[6], data platforms[7] and, if necessary other relevant digital resource platforms. Communicable results from projects should be delivered to the most relevant of these platforms in order to enhance the European AI, Data and Robotics ecosystem through the sharing of results and best practice.
All proposals are expected to allocate tasks to cohesion activities with the PPP on AI, Data and Robotics and funded actions related to this partnership, including the CSA HORIZON-CL4-2021-HUMAN-01-02. Where relevant, synergies with other PPPs are encouraged.

Proposal results are expected to contribute to the following expected outcomes:
European thought leadership in academia and industry on future enabling technologies and their transformational potential in industrial, societal and environmental terms.
Increased engagement for structural collaboration and co-creation between academic, industry players and other stakeholders where roles of research, industry and society intertwine in an iterative and multidisciplinary approach for co-creating the enabling technologies of the future, all the way from low to higher TRLs, such as (but not limited to) bio-enabled technologies, sustainable smart materials and alternative computing models.
Alignment with national or regional initiatives creating an expanding innovation ecosystem, anchored in local contexts across Europe, for selected emerging technologies.
Accelerating the pick-up of novel advanced technology by industry and society.
Scope:
A Coordination and Support Action to create and catalyse a forum for emerging interdisciplinary areas and new technological visions. These actions enable and support a broad range of participants (across disciplines in science and engineering, RTOs, industry sectors, stakeholders) to meet, mutually inspire, cooperate and develop together innovative ideas for future enabling technologies from early stages on (i.e., TRL 3+). They will help industry to navigate rapidly changing environments, for instance by actively transferring ideas and early technologies between players that would not normally interact, or by combinations of different foresight activities (short-term, long-term, cross-sectorial) to prioritise strategic directions while avoiding narrow visions for the future.
Concrete activities will include horizon scanning, portfolio analysis, a variety of participatory workshops, visibility in various meetings, high-profile reporting on emerging enabling technologies. This will build on (and link to) existing programmes and research portfolios from European and national/regional programmes (including at low TRL) as well as broad sourcing from foresight and technology scouting activities, including those specifically done by this action for the cluster 4 industries and sectors. The forum should link to existing initiatives and partnerships and add value by active cross-fertilisation across disciplines and sectors, and by breaking the model of linear progression of technology development. National or regional R&I priorities and orientations from European countries will be taken into consideration. Broader stakeholder engagement is expected.
The forum should become a reference for new enabling technologies at different levels of maturity, their purpose, their transformational pathways and their impacts with a distinctive anchoring in European industry and research, as well as providing guidance and reasoned alternatives for Europe’s transformations, in line with the Commission priorities (in particular, Green Deal, Digitisation, and Industrial Strategy).
Proposals should involve and be driven by representatives of the relevant actors of the field (e.g., academia, RTOs, industry including SMEs).
In this topic the integration of the gender dimension (sex and gender analysis) in research and innovation content is not a mandatory requirement.

Projects are expected to contribute to the following outcomes:
Demonstrate a significant increase of sustainable production through improved control systems and non-destructive inspection methods;
Develop methodologies and tools to prevent the generation of defects at component level and its propagation to the system level;
Create new diagnostic methods for in-situ monitoring of industrial production;
Ensure efficient use of materials, repair strategies, and reduced production cost and time.
Scope:
The projects must address the full production line or system, with an holistic approach, with the aim of reducing defects (e.g. rejected components or products) and manufacturing waste. The defect reduction and the overall quality control should be centred on such defects that reduce the yield, acceptance, or qualification of the final product, and enable a “first-time-right” production process.
Projects should target types of waste or discarded material from identified defective products or components that cannot be easily reworked or recycled without significant effort. This implies a demonstrable transition to a sustainable production, and should include additional elements such as life-cycle analyses and environmental assessments.
The system improvements should address the integration of control systems and/or in-line non-destructive inspection methods in demonstrative use-cases that enable for rapid feedback and/or feedforward control. In addition the project could consider the use of large data sets and analysis, stemming from all sorts of production process and material data, possibly supported by data-sharing between sites, for the creation of comprehensive machine learning algorithms.

Deadline date","ExpectedOutcome:
Projects are expected to contribute to the following outcomes:
Demonstrate relevant scale production of innovative bio-based products to substitute traditional materials with high environmental footprint;
Develop products with similar or better mechanical, physical and chemical properties, while having a substantially lower environmental footprint and being sustainable, non-toxic and recyclable when compared to non-bio-based materials;
Demonstrate disruptive innovation of bio-based materials production in at least three different manufacturing value chains;
Develop sustainable business models for materials sourcing and recycling.
Scope:
The 2020 Circular Economy Action Plan aims at making sustainable products the norm in the EU. Twenty-first century manufacturing requires new materials and new techniques to produce them. Rapid progress in manufacturing technologies using new and alternative materials, such as biomaterials, is one of the drivers of this trend. This new frontier of science is a multidisciplinary research field combining engineering, physics, chemistry, biology, material science, which allow the production of bio-based products. Particularly interesting with respect to the green transition of the economy are sustainable products made from bio-based materials that are easy to reuse and recycle. Also, these materials would reduce the environmental footprint of waste streams. However, the use of reusable and recyclable products based on bio-based materials should increase substantially in order to build a truly sustainable manufacturing industry.
These technologies provide a valid alternative to conventional materials with a substantially lower environmental impact with a range of applications for example in construction, food, medical, packaging and textile industries.
Research activities should address the following areas:
Optimisation and improvement of smart manufacturing processes, e.g. additive manufacturing, injection moulding, extrusion etc., to unlock the full potential of bio-based materials, such as carbon-positive bioplastics, biopolymers and other fibre-based materials (e.g. cellulose-based components and marine-based components);
Use of carbon positive bio-based materials, such as composite, rubber, plastics, in different products to achieve high technical properties while lowering the environmental footprint;
Combine the use of different bio-based materials to facilitate refurbishing and re-manufacturing of products to achieve circularity by design
Adapt existing or new characterisation methods and quality controls for the bio-based materials in different formats and for new and regenerated products;
Support the creation of a skilled workforce, through training/qualification of personnel, capable of using and implementing biomaterial-based manufacturing activities;
Demonstrations and use cases for transitions towards green manufacturing technologies incorporating bio-based materials with a significant reduction in the environmental footprint across the entire manufacturing and/or product lifecycle.
Address standardization activities of bio-based materials and adapted characterisation methods and quality controls for bio-based materials in their different formats and applications.

Projects are expected to contribute to the following outcomes:
Strengthened resilience and sustainability – in its economic, social ecological aspects – of the European industries;
Innovations that combine technological and social innovation and support industry in their transition and the achievement of EU’s priorities;
Inclusive entrepreneurship with a positive social impact;
A new generation of technologically savvy social entrepreneurs;
New business models capitalizing on a new partnerships between industry and society;
New markets.
Scope:
Our society is changing. The COVID-19 crisis has shown how quickly society can adapt and bounce back and has underlined how urgent it was for European industry to reinvent itself and increase its resilience. Social innovation holds the potential to support the industry in this transition, especially when linked to technological innovation. Social innovations can contribute to progress and innovation in all areas and change the way all actors in society interact. They appear in new products, services, methods, business models, production processes or new forms of cooperation. They do things differently and involve academia, industry, public authorities, and civil society. Linking the industry with social innovation would thus support the creation of a more resilient, inclusive and democratic European society and of a dynamic industrial innovation ecosystem while allowing the industry to undertake its transition in a sustainable and fair way.
This topic concerns the generation of innovations that combine technological and social innovation and engage industry and society to serve the EU’s priorities. It will provide social innovators with financial and capacity building support to develop their ideas into concrete solutions enabling businesses to transform towards more resilience, sustainability and inclusion. It will also promote a new European culture of social innovation and social entrepreneurship.
Projects should:
Set up an inclusive mechanism to harvest social innovation ideas. They should issue calls for ideas that are business and industry driven, providing innovative solutions improving the resilience and preparedness of EU businesses in EU policy priority areas and are bottom-up in their approach, involving users and citizens. The following eligibility criterions should be used:
serving at least one EU priority,
combining technological and social innovation,
engaging society and industry,
demonstrated market knowledge and market demand for the solution;
offering an innovative solution.
Ensure a broad dissemination of the calls to reach out to local social innovators with the support, for instance, of the national competence centres for social innovation funded under the EU Programme for Employment and Social Innovation (EaSI).
Select approximately 30 of the best entries, using announced eligibility criterions to rank entries. They should award approximately €100000.
Turn these ideas into pre-market demonstration projects through a process of co-design and co-development, engaging civil society; start-ups, SMEs, mid-caps, and large corporations; academia; public authorities; philanthropists; impact financiers, etc. to the extent appropriate. The consortium should have extensive knowledge in business incubation to be able to provide capacity-building support. Synergies with the ongoing EU funded projects on Incubators for inclusive and social entrepreneurship are encouraged.
Monitor the testing of the pre-market demonstration projects to demonstrate and document that the social innovation achieves investment grade.
Help pre-market demonstration projects to find investors through the portfolio of activities (e.g., matchmaking events, dragon-pitches, auctions, etc.) that they consider best suited.
Two thirds of the EU contribution should go to awards to selected entries and to the financing of pre-market demonstration projects.
Applicants are encouraged to envisage additional sources of financing.
Applicants should envisage, as appropriate, clustering activities with other ongoing and future social innovation projects funded under Horizon 2020 or Horizon Europe projects for, inter-alia, cross-project co-operation, consultations and knowledge exchange, joint activities on crosscutting issues as well as participating in joint meetings and communication events. Applicants should plan the necessary budget to cover those activities without the prerequisite to define concrete common actions at this stage.

Demonstration of cost-efficient, zero-emission modes of last mile transport for urban and peri-urban deliveries in the living labs involved in the projects (as listed in the scope part below).
Increased quality and liveability of urban and metropolitan areas by reducing road risk, congestion, air and noise pollution.
Improve knowledge of user needs, habits and preferences in terms of deliveries by collecting and sharing information amongst public authorities and private companies aiming at clustering users while respecting GPDR.
Scope:
The large scale introduction and application of cargo bikes, in urban and peri-urban areas has shown to be a game changer for cities: the image of cycling improves; general levels of cycling increase (both for freight and passengers); urban space is used more efficiently; air quality, noise and safety levels as well as quality of life improve. However, this innovative solution is present in only a few cities and at best in the starting phase in other European cities. Its full potential has not been achieved in any European city.
Projects should address both methodological and technical/vehicle aspects to help optimising last mile deliveries, where the benefits and how it can be replicated across several cities.
Demonstration of cleaner modes for last mile transport vehicles such as, electric assisted cycles (2/3/4 wheels), bikes and cargo bikes in combination with the testing of innovative tools such as dynamic e-routing, load policies, multi/single-brand parcel lockers and boxes, micro consolidation centres and zero emission freight in the urban context to measure their effects on optimisation (reducing empty miles), efficiency, and congestion reduction should be considered. Results could also contribute to better delivery technologies transforming the last mile such as camera-based object tracking, precise location brought by enhanced EU satellite navigation (GNSS) services, application of AI technologies and CCAM solutions to delivery services and advanced analysis based on driver apps. It is recommended the establishment of energy savings objectives (e.g. electricity) regarding micro-consolidation centres in relation to other traditional strategies.
Actions should focus on piloting cooperation with private logistics operators, local businesses and establish new models for addressing governance and management of logistics operations in urban and peri-urban areas. Projects should achieve cost-efficient and scale up potential and deployment of innovative and sustainable urban people and goods mobility solutions enabled by better governance and regulations, including procurement or white-label schemes as an efficient tool for achieving these goals.
A thorough evaluation, with a clear baseline in each city, should provide qualitative and quantitative information on the results of the local solutions implemented. The effectiveness of the proposed measures in achieving local policy objectives should be evaluated and the possible barriers to their broad take up and deployment identified, together with recommendations on how to overcome them. This should be accompanied by mechanisms for common lesson drawing and learning, within the project, between the projects funded under this topic and through the CIVITAS Initiative.
Proposals may include preparatory, take up and replication actions, research activities, as well as tools to support local planning and policy making.
A demonstrated contribution to the implementation of the cities’ Sustainable Urban Mobility Plans, without forgetting higher scales planning scope, is expected. If not already in place, the city can develop a Sustainable Urban Logistics Plan or other appropriate planning instrument to manage urban freight and logistics.
Funding for major infrastructure works is not covered by this action. Proposals should plan for an active collaboration within the CIVITAS initiative.
Social innovations should be considered, notably as new tools, ideas and methods leading to active citizen engagement and as drivers of social change, social ownership, and new social practices.
This topic requires the effective contribution of SSH disciplines and the involvement of SSH experts, institutions as well as the inclusion of relevant SSH expertise, in order to produce meaningful and significant effects enhancing the societal impact of the related research activities

Project results are expected to contribute to the following expected outcomes:
Contribute to the global target of 50% fewer road fatalities and serious injuries by 2030 in low to medium income countries in Africa.
Contribute to implementing the recommendations of the Road Safety Cluster of the African-EU Transport Task Force adopted in 2020.
More effective design of road safety practices, measures and policies in the targeted countries; establishment of the safe system approach in national road safety strategies.
In line with the Sustainable Development Goals and with the principles of the Joint EU-Africa Strategy (JAES), the activities to be implemented should contribute to the improvement of road safety and traffic fluidity conditions in Africa, ultimately saving thousands of lives and lessening the human, social and economic burden of road accidents.
The reinforcement of endogenous African capabilities with a view to long term sustainable progress in the fight against road casualties and for a more efficient and sustainable transport system.
The dissemination of European know-how and the deployment of sound technical and governance solutions. In particular, the outcomes of the SaferAfrica action should be included (in particular the African Road Safety Observatory).
Scope:
Over 650 road deaths per day occur on African roads and unless measures are taken, road crashes in Africa are projected to increase by 68% over the next decade. African road traffic death rates are the highest globally and more than four times higher than the European average.
Building upon the work and activities already undertaken at EU level in this area, including the Safer Africa project and in line with the recommendations of the Road Safety Cluster of the African-EU Transport Task Force adopted in 2020, R&I is needed to create a strong analytical base and to develop and assess, with local partners, the implementation of small scale system pilots and its various components, at city, regional, national and continent level. Actions should contain the sharing of knowledge and best practice, data analysis, infrastructure for effectively reducing road deaths in Africa.
To address this challenge, proposals should address all of the following:
In-depth road accident investigations should be carried out at least in selected areas/countries to be able to find evidence of the underlying contributing factors behind accidents, whether related to the road user, vehicle, traffic environment or the traffic system.
develop an innovative approach to promote the Safe System approach in selected African countries, enabling the exchange of data, methodologies, training, knowledge and best practice with particular focus on leading road safety agencies, traffic system “owners” such as road authorities, the police, regulating and certifying agencies to support the preparation of their road safety strategies and targets.
Analyse the most appropriate road safety assessment methodologies and traffic management systems, as well as protection principles for the vulnerable road users and vehicle occupants, and define criteria for measuring future progress. Moreover, identify requirements for skills development and training of staff, and research and innovation needs, with a view to quick deployment of suitable solutions.
design, develop and implement a series of small scale pilot demonstration projects to test the implementation of a safe system approach at different levels (national, regional, city), involving different local stakeholders (e.g. civil society organisations such as citizens’ associations, and non-governmental organisations), local government bodies and institutions as well as private companies.
carry out an evaluation and assessment of the pilot demonstration projects that includes feedback from local actors, national and international stakeholders gathered through specific participatory workshops.
Define guidelines detailing requirements and propose recommendations from the small scale pilot demonstrations useful for the implementation of a safe system approach to be up-scaled for the African continent (capacity building).
A balanced participation of European and African partners in these activities is expected, also with the aim of reinforcing endogenous African capabilities, and will be taken into account in the evaluation of proposals. Multinational international cooperation with relevant third countries is encouraged in order to leverage resources and impact.
Typically, projects should have a duration of 36 to 48 months. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts or durations.
Social innovation is recommended when the solution is at the socio-technical interface and requires social change, new social practices, social ownership or market uptake.

Deadline date","ExpectedOutcome:
Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:
Improved monitoring of human performance, system performance and external hazards, in order to pave the way to more automation in aviation while meeting Flightpath2050 safety goals.
Avoiding startle response or “automation surprise”, enabling intelligent assistance to all operators on the air and on the ground in all safety-critical situations and allowing fall-back response in case of severe system perturbations - including pilot incapacitation, cyber-attacks and/or broader operational system-wide failures.
New crew and team configurations, including human-machine teaming, automation supervisory roles and distributed human crew (both airborne and on the ground) to ensure safety and optimise performance without leading to complacency or to loss of critical skills.
Better prepared workforce and training, with smarter selection, qualification and training tools and methods to maintain high standards of safety and resilience, including advanced simulation for complex safety-critical events.
Increased organisational and regulatory preparedness, safety culture and societal acceptance in the advent of more automation in aviation, from earlier integration of human factors and automation into design processes and safety case methods up to ensuring an appropriate level of human factors and automation competence in key organisations, including regulators.
Scope:
Activities should address a renewed safety focus on the teaming between the human and automation, given the steady increase in automation in aviation operations at large (e.g. in cockpit, ATC, maintenance, etc.), including for new airborne services and vehicles such as drones. When automation is unable to cope, control should be handed back safely to the human.
Prepare the next step-change in automation, artificial intelligence (AI), in two steps. Firstly, in the medium term with the role of AI as ‘Digital Assistant’, part of the team, earning the trust of the human operators and the flying public. Secondly, in the long term, with the potential of AI to take over operations. For the transition to digital assistant and ultimately to AI-run operations, develop a novel approach to Human Factors and to safety (and security) assurance methods and processes.
System transition issues should be addressed, to avoid an initial spate of ‘automation-assisted accidents’, as it happened at the last step change in the level of automation in aviation (‘glass cockpits’), which nevertheless resulted in significantly improved safety.
Activities should consider the increasing complexity in aviation e.g. traffic growth expected back in the mid/long-term, more ‘new entrants’ as drones, more extreme weather events, more environmental constraints leading to more complex systems and operations. In such an evolving aviation environment it is needed to better understand and anticipate why incidents happen – the triggering events/hazards, the cognitive failures and the challenges at the human-machine interface – in order to learn the right lessons and then share them both internally and externally. This includes the impact of physical and mental wellbeing on human performance and safety, both in a positive sense (e.g. motivation, positive safety culture) and in a negative sense (e.g. fatigue, constraints during/after pandemic times, fitness for duty, skill loss, and complacency).
More focus is needed then on Human Digital Interface design and on integrating AI into human crews and teams, as a smart assistant to explain, accompany and support operators, in particular at safety-critical situations and to recover from emergencies. More adaptive and trustworthy human-machine systems and more intuitive interfaces should be developed.
Developments should be applied to realistic operational and regulatory contexts while devising how to maintain safety culture and societal acceptance along with organisational and regulatory preparedness. Particular attention should be paid to possible differences such as age, gender and ethnography. Social innovation is recommended when the solution is at the socio-technical interface and requires social change, new social practices, social ownership or market uptake.
This topic requires the effective contribution of Social Sciences and Humanities (SSH) disciplines and the involvement of SSH experts, institutions, as well as the inclusion of relevant SSH expertise, in order to produce meaningful and significant effects enhancing the societal impact of the related research activities.
Activities should go beyond the state of the art and previous R&I activities, at least at EU level[1]. Activities should ensure no overlap but complementarity for integration with any other aviation activities, such as SESAR / Transforming the European ATM System partnership. The proposals may include the explicit commitment from the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) to assist or to participate in the actions[2].
In order to achieve the expected outcomes with increased resources and impact, international cooperation can be foreseen with third countries with relevant capacities in this domain, while ensuring that the respect of European IPR, interests and values is strictly guaranteed.
Synergies with other transport modes and safety/security critical sectors adopting more automation is welcomed, in particular on risk assessment and pre-normative research to ensure fit-for-purpose rulemaking and management systems and a high level of cyber-attack protection.
Synergies with other topics in Horizon Europe can be exploited such as in Cluster 4 e.g. HORIZON-CL4-2021-DIGITAL-EMERGING-01-02 (Software for low-power operation at the edge), HORIZON-CL4-2021-DIGITAL-EMERGING-01-11 (Pushing the limit of robotics cognition), in Cluster 3 e.g. HORIZON-CL3-2021-INFRA-01-01 (European infrastructures and their autonomy safeguarded against systemic risks), as well as with other EU programmes such as Connecting Europe Facility (CEF), NextGenerationEU and Digital Europe.

","single-stage
Deadline date","ExpectedOutcome:
Project outputs and results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes as applicable for the two sub-activities:
Communicable infections (Covid-19, influenza, norovirus) do not spread rapidly amongst passengers and crew on large passenger ships, in particular on cruise ships. The spread is controllable also beyond the vessel in ports and port communities.
Communicable infections on board large passenger ships can be detected systematically at an early stage and effective measures are put in place to prevent the spread of infection. Crews and other personnel are duly trained.
Large passenger ships are intrinsically designed to prevent the spread of infection and to facilitate measures in case of detection to eliminate further spread.
An evidence base is established concerning the specific mechanisms facilitating the on-board spread of infection and the effectiveness of different mitigation methods.
A knowledge base is publicly available concerning mechanisms facilitating the spread of on-board infection, mitigation measures and underlying evidence.
Evidence based guidance for healthy passenger ship design is available to improve the design of ships which can help avoiding infections and facilitate the detection on board infections at an early stage, inherently mitigate the spread of infection and facilitate actions to prevent its further spread.
Scope:
Passenger ships and in particular cruise ships (with their high occupancy rates and elevated passenger and crew numbers of up to 8000 persons, close proximity of passengers and crews, high crew turnover with crews coming from many different countries, frequent port calls naturally implying common shore side excursions, and on-board activities with intense social interaction) have been implicated in the spread and multiplication of disease. Large and medium-sized cruise ships have seen a highly dynamic and sometimes dramatic multiplication of Covid-19 infections on-board and the disembarkation of several hundred infected (and often asymptomatic) passengers who subsequently became vectors for infection within the regions concerned and their home regions. In this context it needs to be kept in mind that cruise passengers often travel to and from the ship by air, adding to the potential spread. Passenger ships have also been hosts for the rapid spread of Norovirus illness, influenza and legionella infections. This can be particularly problematic for (generally smaller) passenger ships that undertake longer expedition-type cruises away from population centres, thus entirely or predominantly relying on on-board medical services and facilities. Europe as the world’s largest and almost exclusive producer of large and medium-sized passenger and cruise ships and as home to a large number of important cruise destinations must ensure a healthy on-board environment which is also crucial for the viability and the sustainable growth of the business. Whilst guidelines to control the spread of on-board infections have been published, it is clear that these are not fully effective and there is a lack of an evidence base to underpin the effectiveness of the suggested measures for different infections. Important knowledge gaps continue to exist and so far the real effectiveness of different mitigation measures now deployed remains largely anecdotal.
To address these challenges, proposals will address one of the following two aspects and cover all of the tasks mentioned.
“Infection control on-board large passenger ships - prevention, mitigation and management”.
Establishing a comprehensive scientific basis concerning the effectiveness of different prevention, mitigation and management measures.
Developing and demonstrating solutions for improving the prevention, mitigation and management of on-board disease and illness.
Cooperate and coordinate with other projects selected from this topic as well as other relevant actions such as the EU’s “healthy gateways” action.
Outcomes and data to be made publicly available to facilitate the take up of best practices, also in function of vessel type and size, type of cruise and cruise destination. A distinction should be made between large ferries as typically deployed in Europe and cruise ships.
“Healthy ship design”:
Applying a bottom-up evidence based approach address the functional and concept design of large passenger ships so as to reduce the on-board spread of infection.
Research should in particular address ventilation systems and their airflows, germicidal surfaces and disinfection practices, contamination control in all relevant ship areas, facilitating enhanced quarantine, process separation, the design of social areas including those for the crew, the design of crew work areas, especially pantries, laundries etc.. In this respect a better interaction of people with the vessel and its equipment on the basis of social innovations (e.g. hands-free accessibility solutions) should also be considered.
Innovative systems should be addressed to enable early stage detection of the spread of on-board infections such as for example employing AI, big data, smart sensors etc.
Cooperate and coordinate with other projects selected from this topic as well as other relevant actions such as the EU’s “healthy gateways” action.
Outcomes and guidance concerning healthy ship design should be made available to facilitate the take up of best practices by ship interior designers, shipyards, and equipment manufacturers.

Deadline date","ExpectedOutcome:
In line with the EU biodiversity strategy for 2030[1], the topic aims to support the development of policies, business decisions and knowledge generation, to tackle the indirect drivers of biodiversity loss, and accelerate biodiversity-relevant transformative changes in businesses and our society.
Successful proposals will help integrate biodiversity into business decisions to improve:
public health and well-being and to tackle inequalities, create new jobs and sustainable growth in rural, post-industrial and coastal areas; strengthen resilience against environmental and climate stressors; minimise the risks of future diseases linked to business activities, with disastrous health, economic and social impacts, and
corporate decision making and business resilience and to minimise investment risk and thereby play a key role in the sustainable transition of the economy.
Projects should produce all following outcomes:
A better understanding and awareness of how businesses depend, and impact upon, biodiversity and ecosystem services, based on past and ongoing knowledge, also from practical business experience (by private companies), to feed into business decision making.
Making available knowledge (e.g. meta-studies, publications) for the production of the IPBES methodological assessment on business and biodiversity, which is planned to be adopted in 2024-25, following a fast-track approach. Putting in place capacity building, policy support, and science brokerage of the projects, including after the release dates of the IPBES assessment, through effective and impactful dissemination.
Making accessible scientific evidence that is directly relevant to multiple Sustainable Development Goals, in particular closely related to Goals 9 (build resilient infrastructure, promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization and foster innovation), 12 (ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns, i.e., issues of production and efficient use of natural resources), 13 (climate change), 14 (life below water) and 15 (life on land).
Scope:
Key economic sectors depend on and have a direct and indirect, positive or negative impact on biodiversity. Biodiversity is directly at the centre of many economic activities, and a healthy biodiverse planet is a precondition for humankind to exist – and thus for businesses to grow and for the economy to recover following a crisis such as the COVID-19 pandemic.
Keeping nature healthy is critical for the economy, both directly and indirectly. The World Economic Forum ranks biodiversity loss and ecosystem collapse as one of the top five threats humankind will face in the next ten years. Businesses rely on biodiversity as inputs into their production processes, with over half of global GDP – some €40 trillion – dependent on nature and the services it provides.
Conversely, if we continue doing business as usual, and contribute to destroying ecosystems, the continued degradation of our natural capital will considerably limit business opportunities and socio-economic development potential. Internalising biodiversity into business decisions can enhance the health and well-being of all people and tackle inequalities, create new jobs and sustainable growth in rural, post-industrial and coastal areas; strengthen resilience against environmental and climate stressors; and minimise the risks of future outbreaks of infectious diseases with disastrous health, economic and social impacts. From the perspective of the private sector companies, integrating natural capital and biodiversity impacts and dependencies will enhance corporate decision making and business resilience as well as minimise investment risks. It will better inform, transform and improve their companies’ sustainable decision-making processes, including by removing key blind spots in company risk assessments.
This means putting together a highly interdisciplinary team of experts, including biodiversity and corporate practitioners. It needs to cover biophysical and socio-economic aspects related to multiple sectors that have different impacts and ways of managing and accounting. Key expertise is needed in accounting, ecology, business management and organisation, social, political and environmental economics. This topic does not cover developing natural capital accounts or measuring biodiversity footprints.
The proposals should cover all of the following points:
identifying criteria and indicators for measuring dependence, impact and contribution to the recovery of biodiversity and ecosystem services;
developing methods to reduce adverse impacts and related material and reputational risks, and to develop the business case for long-term sustainability, for business sectors in addition to forestry, agriculture and fisheries, tourism, energy and mining, infrastructure and manufacturing and processing, that are directly dependent upon ecosystem services;
developing a tool box to measure, assess and monitor the dependence and impact of the business sector on biodiversity, improved risk management linked to biodiversity, and the contribution of business to biodiversity recovery[2];
assessing the broader impact of businesses on biodiversity, the cumulative impact and the indirect impact from supply chains, trade or substitution effects (such as tele-coupling);
collating targets and regulations (at any level within the EU and in associated countries) that stimulate innovation generating a positive impact on biodiversity and on the decoupling of environmental pressures from increased output;
promoting (1) business cases that contribute to the conservation, restoration and sustainable use of biodiversity and the wide range of ecosystem services and (2) public accountability, informing regulatory agencies and guiding financial investments and influencing producer, retailer and consumer behaviour. Analysing the added value of creating a Horizon Europe prize[3] for innovative businesses that improve biodiversity and its wide range of ecosystem services, focused on nature-based solutions[4]. Delivering timely input to IPBES assessment on business, and the processes on IPBES objectives for building capacity, strengthening the knowledge basis, supporting policy, and communicating and engaging, on impact and dependence of business on biodiversity, and the relevant IPBES task forces.
Proposals should also show how their results could provide timely information on project outcomes to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), and to the Convention on Biological Diversity. Projects are expected to cooperate with projects HORIZON-CL6-2021-BIODIV-01-20: Support to processes triggered by IPBES and IPCC, HORIZON-CL6-2022-BIODIV-01-10: Cooperation with the Convention on Biological Diversity and HORIZON-CL6-2022-BIODIV-01-04: Natural capital accounting: Measuring the biodiversity footprint of products and organizations.
Proposals should make available the relevant evidence, data and information via the Oppla portal, and prepare to feed in the uptake of its results according to an agreed format to the EC Knowledge Centre for Biodiversity. Collaboration with the Knowledge Centre should also include its stakeholders forum.
The project should set out a clear plan on how it will collaborate with other projects selected under this and any other relevant topics, such as HORIZON-CL6-2021-BIODIV-01-16: Biodiversity, water, food, energy, transport, climate and health nexus in the context of transformative change, and with the European partnership on biodiversity HORIZON-CL6-2021-BIODIV-02-01[5], by participating in joint activities such as workshops or communication and dissemination activities. The project should also set out a clear plan on how it will collaborate with key business-related networks that promote the integration of biodiversity into corporate decision making. Proposals should include specific tasks and allocate sufficient resources for these coordination measures.
This topic should involve the contributions from the social science and humanities disciplines.

In support of the European Green Deal and EU water-related policies, successful proposals will contribute to foster the adaptation of water resources to climate change, in particular Destination ‘Land, ocean and water for climate action’ impacts “Advance the understanding and science, and support adaptation and resilience of natural and managed ecosystems, water and soil systems and economic sectors in the context of the changing climate” and “Improve tools and technologies for efficient monitoring, assessment and projections related to climate change impact”
Projects results are expected to contribute to several of the following expected outcomes
Enhanced knowledge base regarding water related climate change impacts, vulnerability, risk and adaptation assessments in Europe and abroad.
Provide a more complete picture of future water vulnerabilities, including both water quantity and quality aspects, by better considering the interactions among climate change and variability, land surface and groundwater hydrology, water engineering, and human systems, including societal adaptations to water scarcity
Support decision makers defining the safe operating space in terms of water quantity and availability, i.e., defining sustainable water management and climate change adaptation measures, meeting growing water supply, food, and energy needs, and controlling the high inter-annual variability in water availability
Improve Member States’ preparedness for climate change impacts with respect to floods and droughts and support more accurate decision making for flood and drought risk reduction and response.
Improve knowledge of ecological flows in the context of the Water Framework Directive and especially of the impacts of management, infrastructure and climate on ecological flows; improve prediction of drought events and water scarcity and enhance the assessment of the impacts of drought on water quality and biodiversity.
Minimise the disparities associated with data collection and reporting between researchers and data agencies, enhance the interoperability, in particular through the mainstreaming of community-accepted standards, metadata schemas and data management best practices in line with the FAIR principles, between data providers and data users and strengthen coordination among various monitoring services
Foster commitments between climate change and water scientists, monitoring services, industry, water utilities and other socioeconomic communities to collect, standardise, and widely disseminate information on water use in different sectors.
Scope:
Freshwater resources are under increasing stress as a consequence of overuse and climate change with wide-ranging consequences for human societies and ecosystems. To reduce the vulnerability of ecosystems, society and water consuming economic sectors (agriculture, energy, industry) to climate change, it is necessary to enhance the knowledge on water resource availability and use, on future changes to climate and hydrological systems and on risks of extreme weather events.
Actions should address one or more of the following issues:
A comparative assessment of the state-of-the-art integrated river basin models that are currently used for assessing water availability and vulnerability in the context of climate change. Models should be capable of simulating both surface and groundwater quantity and quality issues, as well as water supply and use and land use changes. They should be also able to take into account the socio-economic impacts of future climate change scenarios, as well as the costs and benefits associated with the adaptation strategies defined in response to those. In assessing water availability, an estimation should be made of the environmental flows necessary to sustain the health of both terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. The impacts of various management and hydraulic infrastructure systems on the ecological flows of water and sediments should also be considered in this estimation. Assessments should be carried out in several river basins within and outside Europe, which are particularly vulnerable to climate change impacts and are facing significant water related problems, with a view to providing policy recommendations for long term infrastructure investments and management strategies beyond the river basins addressed.
Improve accuracy and spatiotemporal resolution of regional scale projections of changes in precipitation, soil moisture, runoff and groundwater availability for management purposes, and quantification of the related uncertainties. Projections of changes in the frequency and intensity of extreme events such as severe storms, heat waves, floods, including flash floods and droughts should be also made. The potential of recent global observation studies and data collections, in cooperation with relevant EU earth observation initiatives, such as ESA, should be considered.
Development of techniques, monitoring tools and innovative sensors for advance measurement and calculation of current available water balances and future needs and monitoring, leveraging on advanced computation technologies (e.g. high performance computing, edge analytics, cloud computing, and grid computing), artificial intelligence and Internet of Things
Development of a long-term observation framework and capacity, in collaboration with the Copernicus programme and GEOSS and any other relevant global observation initiatives, to support integrated analysis of water resource availability in Europe, including the development of community-driven, open access, end-to-end data infrastructures. This framework should be linked the European Open Science Cloud, as a pan-European cross-sectoral data space for research and innovation, and should include all relevant in situ and earth observations needed to monitor and assess the impacts of climate change on water resource availability and to support integrated model developments and adaptation planning responses. Both surface and groundwater resources as well as water quantity and water quality issues should be considered. Particular attention should be given to ensuring availability of data to measure and/or assess relevant water use. In developing this framework, a thorough review of existing observational systems and initiatives at both EU and global level developed over recent years should be undertaken, and experiences and lessons learnt from previous long term water related research studies across a wide range of river basins within and outside Europe should be considered. Cooperation with relevant European water observation institutions and initiatives, such as ESA, EEA and JRC, is important.
Actions should bring together a multidisciplinary and multi‐institutional team of researchers to pursue a combination of ﬁeld data collection, innovative data analysis methods, artificial intelligence and the development of data‐driven reduced-complexity models for scientiﬁc understanding and to guide management decisions, and to support relevant stakeholders and policy makers.
All in-situ data collected through actions funded from this call should follow INSPIRE[1] principles.
In general, the participation of academia, research organisations, utilities, industry and regulators is strongly advised, as well as civil society engagement whenever necessary, also aiming to broaden the dissemination and exploitation routes and to better assess the innovation potential of developed solutions and strategies.

","single-stage
Deadline date","ExpectedOutcome:
A successful proposal should contribute to the European Green Deal and international objectives to foster climate change mitigation and adaptation in agriculture. It should in particular support the farm to fork's strategy objective of a transition to a fair, healthy and resilient European agriculture, notably its objective to promote agroecology, by unfolding its potential as a farming system based on the sustainable management of natural resources. Activities should improve the knowledge base to inform decision-makers and other relevant stakeholders on how agroecology can contribute to these objectives, while remaining a profitable activity for farmers.
Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:
Increased and robust evidence of the potential of agroecology for climate change (mitigation and adaptation), its climate neutrality potential, impact on biodiversity, and the potential for improving farm socio-economic resilience. This should be achieved through quantitative and qualitative assessments allowing to identify and monitor the implementation and performance of optimal combinations of agroecological practices and strategies, as well as trade-offs or gains, barriers and drivers, for different crops and systems representative of the diversity of EU and Associated Countries farming, and at the farm and landscape level;
Qualitative and quantitative data availability of the social, economic and environmental sustainability and performance of agroecological strategies, contributing to a dependable and transparent knowledge base for EU policy design and implementation (common agricultural policy (CAP), European Green Deal, objectives of the farm to fork and biodiversity strategies, etc.);
Increased understanding, adoption and implementation of agroecological practices by farmers;
Improved understanding of the definition of agroecology and of its application to EU and Associated Countries farming.
Scope:
Achieving sustainable agricultural production that fosters both climate change mitigation and adaptation of agriculture to climate change is a policy objective that implies finding a balance with productivity and wider sustainability goals, such as preserving and enhancing biodiversity. Agroecology[1] can provide an important contribution to achieving these objectives, while at the same time enhancing food and nutrition security, thus contributing to achieving the objectives of the farm to fork and biodiversity strategies and the Sustainable Development Goals. Agroecology is a holistic approach that relies on and maximises the use of ecological processes to support agricultural production. By working more with nature and ecosystem services, agroecology has the potential to increase the circularity, diversification and autonomy of farms, and drive a full transformation of farming systems, from input substitution and beyond. The effectiveness of agroecology is context-specific and practices need to be implemented on a significant proportion of farms to deliver tangible impacts on sustainability. Specific methods and indicators are needed to monitor and quantify the positive effects of these practices on climate change mitigation and adaptation at the farm and landscape levels, along with its impacts on yield stability, farm viability and biodiversity, for different farming systems and pedo-climatic conditions. Moreover, improving farmers’ uptake of agroecological practices calls for specific support measures and for the design of specific business cases at the farm and landscape levels.
Activities should improve knowledge of the contribution of agroecological practices to climate change mitigation, increased adaptation of farming to climate change, and preservation and enhancement of biodiversity, while ensuring farm profitability, thus providing an important contribution to policy design. Proposals should cover the wide range of crops and farming systems present in the EU and Associated Countries agricultural sector, from conventional to organic. Proposals must implement the 'multi-actor approach', and ensure adequate involvement of the farming sector. Projects funded under this topic should build on the results of relevant projects funded under Horizon 2020 and should ensure collaboration with projects funded under calls HORIZON-CL6-2022-FARM2FORK-02-01-two-stage: Agroecological approaches for sustainable weed management and HORIZON-CL6-2021-FARM2FORK-01-03: Digitalisation as an enabler of agroecological farming systems in this work programme.
Proposals should identify, evaluate and deliver a method that allows identification of the optimal combinations of agroecological practices and the most suitable agroecological strategies that efficiently contribute to climate change mitigation and adaptation while ensuring biodiversity preservation or enhancement and overall farm profitability. Proposals should improve existing indicators and develop new ones where relevant, to monitor and measure the qualitative and quantitative impacts of these strategies, including their climate neutrality potential and trade-offs or gains in biodiversity, and the associated improvement in farm socio-economic resilience. Proposals should develop tools to identify and monitor both the implementation of agroecological practices in farm management and the full-farm agroecological approaches, analysing the scale-dependent effects from farm to landscape level, as well as the opportunities and challenges derived from regulation and market aspects. Proposals should develop and test innovative mechanisms to accompany farmers in implementing and/or switching to agroecological practices that contribute to mitigating climate change and other negative environmental impacts. Proposals should undertake an analysis of the social, environmental and economic sustainability performance of such strategies and analyse the potential to integrate such practices in business cases at farm level, including exploring the potential of labelling of products linked to agroecological practices in support of and complying with the current relevant legal framework and, where the scope of activities would cover the food system, the future EU framework for food sustainability labelling to promote and scale-up their uptake.
This topic requires the effective contribution of SSH disciplines.

","single-stage
Deadline date","ExpectedOutcome:
Activities should contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:
establishment of an International Research Consortium (IRC) on soil carbon and related issues;
creation of a knowledge platform for sharing information on relevant research activities and results concerning methodologies for soil carbon balance monitoring, and practices for increasing soil carbon (e.g. carbon farming);
better coordination of research activities and of methods for monitoring soil carbon stock changes at global level, thereby maximising complementarities and avoiding duplication of efforts;
validated methods to support national greenhouse gas (GHG) inventories;
increased transparency with regard to progress towards commitments on soil carbon under the Paris Agreement on Climate Change.
On the long(er) term, activities will contribute to meeting international commitments concerning carbon sinks (Paris agreement), as well as to the European Green Deal overall objective to become the world's first climate neutral continent by 2050.
Scope:
Soil health is threatened both in Europe and globally by the effects of human activities and climate change. It is estimated that between one fourth and one third of global soils suffer from degradation. Soil degradation negatively impacts on food production, biodiversity or soil’s capacity to retain water and store carbon. Urgent action is needed to stabilise and increase soil carbon in soils, thereby also drawing down atmospheric CO2 and monitor its status in more reliable ways, at a range of scales from field to region and at a low cost. Yet, knowledge and methodological gaps exist in relation to measuring soil carbon stocks and changes in soil carbon as well as with regard to effective measures for increasing soil carbon. Furthermore, research and innovation (R&I) efforts are dispersed and results not widely known or taken up.
International research cooperation is needed to pool resources and scale up efforts for monitoring soil carbon stock changes, remote sensing and modelling. Activities should include
building a formal research cooperation between EU and international partners on soil carbon. While initially focusing on carbon in agricultural soils, the partnership should progressively expand during the lifetime of the project to address also other land uses (e.g. forests, pastures, public areas for recreation including in urban settings);
an analysis of results of on-going R&I and knowledge sharing through a single online knowledge platform with access to information and data from different existing repositories;
building a roadmap for R&I priorities at international level based on identified knowledge gaps as well as identifying and developing joint flagship initiatives;
establishing the methodological basis for a harmonised monitoring and verification of soil organic carbon balance.
For activities involving satellite-based earth observation, positioning, navigation and/or related timing, the selected project should use as much as possible Copernicus and/or Galileo / EGNOS (taking into account possible limitations on their use by international partners). Other data and services may be used additionally.
Activities should be implemented in synergy with major soil related European initiatives including the European Joint Programme EJP Soil and a planned mission in the area of Soil Health and Food.

In line with the EU biodiversity strategy, successful proposals will develop knowledge and tools to understand the role of transformative change for biodiversity policy making, address the indirect drivers of biodiversity loss, and initiate, accelerate and upscale biodiversity-relevant transformative changes in our society.
Projects should address all following outcomes:
Tools promoting the benefits of biodiversity are taken up by policy makers, industries, civil society organisations including NGOs, financing entities, businesses and retailers. These solutions can include a stocktaking of good practice (in addition to natural capital accounting and reporting), standards, agreements, charters, commitments, regulations, financing streams (positive incentives vs harmful subsidies), engaging society and incorporating lifelong learning.
Increased use and mainstreaming of ‘green over grey’ approaches, in particular by adopting nature-based solutions on land and at sea, in line with the Green Deal’s ‘do no significant harm’ principle.
Ways to facilitate the application of systemic, sustainable policy mixes and governance approaches, based on a range of policy tools, economic instruments or regulations.
Developing and testing approaches on (1) mitigating existing and future risks to biodiversity and on (2) better reflecting how biodiversity loss affects company business models, value chains, profitability and long-term prospects, so that methods and tools can be integrated into decisions, while factoring in societal and democratic processes (citizen engagement, political campaigns, science denialism).
Making options available on how to implement in practice the renewed sustainable finance strategy for the financial system to generate a positive impact on biodiversity.
Promoting tax systems and pricing that reflect environmental costs, including biodiversity loss, to shift the tax burden from labour to pollution, and to tackle the issue of under-priced resources and other environmental externalities.
Making available case studies on what transformational change[1] means in practice.
Improving the understanding of the biodiversity inter-dependencies of the SDGs. Supporting IPBES and IPCC work by providing input from European research and innovation. Providing approaches, tools and knowledge influence policies at the right level on transformative change for biodiversity. The key elements for this change will be delivered by the broader portfolio of collaborative projects (of which these projects developing the toolbox for transformative changes with a positive effect on biodiversity, providing policy mixes, science-policy communication, governance and decision-making tools form part).
Scope:
Policy mixes, governance (including financing) and decision-making tools to achieve the necessary ecological, climate, economic and social transition for biodiversity are not yet widely available, and must be developed. Proposals should take up the work of the renewed sustainable finance strategy which will help ensure that the financial system contributes to mitigating existing and future risks to biodiversity.
Proposals should look at how to further mainstream biodiversity into policy making, science, and governance (including financing) to achieve transformative action within and beyond socio-economic, climate and environmental agendas.
Proposals should build their analysis on the synergies of multiple Sustainable Development Goals, to deliver direct and indirect biodiversity benefits, and on the role of biodiversity in reaching the set of Sustainable Development Goals.
Proposals should produce case studies and a collection of good and failed examples of developing and implementing policy tools, best practices and instruments, which could feed into the just transformation process and inform and inspire transformative change through learning, co-creation and dialogue.
Proposals should include specific tasks and allocate sufficient resources to develop joint deliverables (e.g. activities, workshops, joint communication and dissemination) with all projects on transformative change related to biodiversity funded under this destination. They should use existing platforms and information sharing mechanisms relevant for transformational change and on biodiversity knowledge[2]. Projects are expected to cooperate with the European partnership on biodiversity (HORIZON-CL6-2021-BIODIV-02-01) and the Science Service (HORIZON-CL6-2021-BIODIV-01-19). Proposals should show how their results and outcomes could provide timely information for major science-policy bodies such as the Intergovernmental science-policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES), the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), and the Convention on Biological Diversity[3].

In line with the EU biodiversity strategy, successful proposals will develop knowledge and tools to understand the role of transformative change for biodiversity, tackle indirect drivers of biodiversity loss, and initiate, accelerate and upscale biodiversity-relevant transformative change in our society.
Digital technologies are transforming all sectors of society, from food production to mobility, energy, climate mitigation and adaptation measures, construction, infrastructure, technology use, human behaviour and societal organisation, with different impacts on and perceptions of biodiversity, due to the speed, scale and level of connectivity of these transformations. Projects should help identify a safe operating space, in which digitalisation and new emerging technologies generate no unsustainable rebound effects, but instead can be a vehicle for accelerating and amplifying the transition to a safe and just world for humankind whilst protecting, restoring and sustainably using biodiversity and ecosystem services.
Project should address all following outcomes:
A better understanding, today and for the future, of the impacts on, risks and opportunities for biodiversity of digital transformation (for example smart technologies, artificial intelligence, automation, miniaturised sensors, citizen science applications, crowdsourcing), new materials (e.g. for biomimicry), and new and emerging technologies.
Identification and an assessment of how system-level change affecting biodiversity through social innovation happens. This should cover bringing in new technologies, new production processes, consumer products, regulations, incentives, or participatory processes, and changes how socio-technical and socio-ecological systems operate.
Making proposals for safeguards to build public understanding of the range of diverse values held by members of the public (i.e. indigenous communities, youth, women, vulnerable groups in society, socially or economically marginalised groups), to promote democracy and a socially just transition taking action on biodiversity. Proposals should promote incorporating these safeguards in transformative processes linked to the digital sector and technology, which can have positive or negative impacts on biodiversity and on the wide range of services ecosystems can provide.
Demonstrating the potential of social innovation to tackle biodiversity loss, as well as using biodiversity and the ecosystem services it provides, with nature-based solutions as case studies. Demonstrating how nature-based solutions, enabled by social innovation, tackle poverty, low resilience and social inequality to achieve a just transition.
Testing active intervention by R&I policy and sector policies (niche creation, reformulation of governance, ‘exnovation’), also by empowering and endowing communities.
Approaches, tools and knowledge influence policies provided at the right level on transformative change for biodiversity. The key elements for this change are to be delivered by the portfolio of cooperating projects (of which these projects form part).
Outcomes should be formulated in such a way that enables their potential users (policy makers, institutions, businesses, engineers, civil society) to understand and concretely apply them, including for monitoring, accounting and reporting purposes. The outcomes should be translated into options to ratchet up the targets and enabling mechanisms of the EU biodiversity strategy for 2030, the global post-2020 biodiversity framework, and to feed input into the processes on the Paris Agreement, the Sustainable Development Goals and IPBES. With the focus on the impacts and opportunities of digital transformation, new emerging technologies and social innovation on biodiversity for the EU and associated countries, projects are strongly encouraged to engage in international cooperation, in particular with African countries, Brazil, Latin American and Caribbean countries or the Mediterranean region, in order to understand differences between the EU/AC and other world regions.
Scope:
Proposals should generate, collect and distribute knowledge on how to tackle the indirect drivers of biodiversity loss linked to technological and social innovation, which includes digitalisation. They should also assess the impacts on biodiversity of the digital divide between urban, peri-urban and rural areas. Proposals should explain how changes in our societies are fostered by technological and social innovation impacting biodiversity – for example by bringing in new and emerging technologies, new production processes, consumer products, regulations, incentives, or participatory processes, which change how socio-technical and socio-ecological systems operate.
Proposals are expected to contribute to informing stakeholders and users on the social and technological impacts of new and emerging technologies that are not covered by existing procedures for biodiversity-related risk assessments[1]. This includes the wider positive and negative impacts on societal values, behaviour, institutional, financial and business frameworks, which in turn are having an impact on biodiversity and the capacity of ecosystems to provide a wide range of services.
Proposals should assess which tools further mainstream biodiversity into policy making, and governance (including financing, the promotion of innovation, and bringing in new and emerging technologies) to achieve transformative action that benefits biodiversity, to avoid, mitigate or manage conflicts linked to these transformational changes[2]. In doing this, proposals should engage with civil society, policy makers, finance and business leaders, to create a toolbox for transformative change via action on biodiversity.
Proposals should build their analysis on the synergies between multiple Sustainable Development Goals to deliver both direct and indirect biodiversity benefits, staying within planetary boundaries, and on the role of biodiversity in reaching the set of Sustainable Development Goals. Proposals should factor in impacts and opportunities of digital transformation, new emerging technologies and social innovation on biodiversity. This explicitly includes the interdependence of biodiversity loss and climate change, and the impacts on biodiversity of digital, technological or social approaches on action to mitigate and adapt to climate change – and vice versa.
Proposals should develop pathways for digital developments to achieve a successful twin digital and biodiversity transition. They should develop methodologies to assess their impacts (including the impacts from energy/electricity infrastructure, or on democracy and on trust in science) on environmental, social and economic systems. Such assessments should focus on the direct and indirect effects of digital developments on biodiversity, intertwined with climate change and health.
Proposals should provide case studies and a collection of good and failed examples, including current relevant business models, the role of citizen science, and scenarios that could provide useful impact to these transformations and inform and inspire transformative change through learning, co-creation and dialogue.
Proposals should include specific tasks and allocate sufficient resources to develop joint deliverables (e.g. activities, workshops, and joint communication and dissemination) with all projects on transformative change related to biodiversity funded under this destination. They should use existing platforms and information sharing mechanisms relevant to transformational change and to biodiversity knowledge[3].

Deadline date","ExpectedOutcome:
In line with the Commission priority 'A stronger Europe in the world', to implement the EU Green Deal and demonstrated leadership as stipulated in the EU biodiversity strategy for 2030, a successful proposal will step up EU support to processes triggered by IPBES and IPCC[1] to achieve targeted impacts on biodiversity-relevant policies, and to integrate structured policy input into the research cycle. Projects should produce all following outcomes:
EU projects and initiatives are aware of and use the knowledge generation, policy support and capacity building functions of IPBES, including the recommendations issued by its task forces (for IPBES and IPCC).
better take up IPBES and IPCC findings and conclusions.
Resolving shortcomings in the uptake of IPBES assessments in sectorial policy making other than for biodiversity, and business decisions at European, national and local level, when translating its outcomes into options for better protecting and restoring biodiversity and ecosystem services.
Scope:
Science-policy interfaces on biodiversity and nature-based solutions have made good progress in the last years, but must be stepped up to achieve the targeted impacts on biodiversity-relevant policies, and to get structured policy input into the research cycle. They are also key in guiding biodiversity governance, and in implementing the EU Green Deal and international conventions. In line with the Commission’s priority 'A stronger Europe in the world', the European Union must take and demonstrate leadership in this field, notably by increasing its support to IPBES -to elevate it to the same level as the IPCC-, and for the Convention on Biological Diversity. Besides economic support, this also includes efforts to create synergies and cooperation between IPBES, regional Multilateral Environmental Agreements, and other relevant research communities to ensure a full coverage of all relevant aspects of biodiversity and ecosystem services in order to underpin the full scope of the post 2020 global biodiversity framework.
This action delivers targeted support to areas of specific interest for European research policy by using IPBES outputs. It also helps European researchers play their role in IPBES assessments, in particular those from southern, central and eastern European countries, and those from the Western Balkans, Central Asia, and from Africa[2], who remain underrepresented, due to a lack of capacity to participate in meetings, networking or science input at global level. Three major functions of IPBES still need to be further developed to achieve a proper level of uptake in Europe: knowledge generation, policy support and capacity building functions, including the task forces.
The project should cover the following points:
providing assistance to the EU and associated countries, and to central Asian and to African researchers, knowledge holders and local communities for input into IPBES and IPCC;
networking between scientific disciplines relevant to IPBES and IPCC (e.g. between SSH, STEM);
translating IPBES output into EU languages, targeted to a wider readership by the EU public, interest groups, research and innovation projects, policy makers and businesses in cooperation with ‘HORIZON-CL6-2021-BIODIV-01-19: A mechanism for science to inform implementation, monitoring, review and ratcheting up the new EU biodiversity strategy (‘Science Service’)’;
facilitating synergies through cooperation between IPBES and IPCC researchers and relevant regional Multilateral Environment Agreements, such as the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) Air Convention;
proposing standards for EU-funded biodiversity projects in applying the relevant work of the IPBES data and knowledge task force;
supporting European negotiators at IPBES plenary meetings and inter-sessional work (such as for the review of assessments, the work of task forces and preparation for plenary groups);
improving the level of coherence in how the EU and associated countries give input into both, CBD (e.g. SBSTTA/SBI) and IPBES processes in cooperation with ‘HORIZON-CL6-2022-BIODIV-01-10: Cooperation with the Convention on Biological Diversity’.
The project should detail a plan on how the work can be further financed and governed over the medium- and long-term and secure commitments that enable the work to continue after the funding of this topic ends.
Proposals must not develop any new platforms but ensure that all relevant evidence, data and information is accessible through e.g. the Oppla portal and cooperate with existing networks of national platforms[3]. They must also prepare the inclusion of its results to the EC Knowledge Centre for Biodiversity according to an agreed format.
The project is to set a clear plan on how it will plan to collaborate with other projects selected under this and any other related topics, such as ‘HORIZON-CL6-2021-BIODIV-01-16: Biodiversity, water, food, energy, transport, climate and health nexus in the context of transformative change’ and ‘HORIZON-CL6-2021-BIODIV-01-21: Impact and dependence of business on biodiversity’, and with the Biodiversity Partnership (HORIZON-CL6-2021-BIODIV-02-01). This includes links to ESFRI research infrastructures, to test whether they could host predictive models, visualization and analysis of their platform's, early warning systems, to respond to IPBES assessments and CBD requests), by participating in joint activities such as workshops or joint communication and dissemination measures. Proposals should include dedicated tasks and allocate sufficient resources for coordination measures.
This topic should involve the contribution from the social sciences and humanities disciplines.

","single-stage
Deadline date","ExpectedOutcome:
In line with the EU Green Deal objectives and the EU forest strategy, successful proposals will support the preservation and enhancement of carbon stocks and sinks while supporting biodiversity, genetic diversity within and among tree species, and providing renewable resources for a circular and sustainable bioeconomy contributing to fostering climate change mitigation in the primary sector and carbon sinks and optimising and deploying nature-based solutions for climate neutrality.
Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:
Forest managers adapting to sustainable management practices in view of climate change, bioeconomy, genetic diversity and biodiversity objectives;
Improved knowledge on scenarios and sustainable pathways for forestry and the forest-based sector including measures and management strategies taking into account regional differences in Europe and changes in species composition;
Increased forest-based carbon removals through forest management practices and uses of long-lived wood products;
Better understanding on how forest management impacts carbon sequestration in comparison to non-managed forests;
Pathways to achieve the ambition of the Paris Agreement ambition to limit climate warming;
Transfer of knowledge from science to practice (good practice).
Scope:
Carbon sequestration by forest ecosystems has attracted much interest as a mitigation approach, as it can be considered as a relatively inexpensive option to address climate change in the short- medium- and long term. Forest lands, covered by the regulation on land use, land-use changes and forestry, are expected to contribute to the achievement of Europe's climate ambition for 2030. As shown in the in-depth analysis in support of the “Clean Planet for all” communication, this contribution needs to be increasing to achieve climate neutrality by 2050.
This topic aims to increase the science-based knowledge for an efficient implementation of good management practices that ensure the multiple functions of various forest types in Europe and to increase forest carbon stocks in the short-, medium-, and long-term.
Proposals will:
Contribute to a better understanding of favourable management practices for both soil and vegetation, within-species genetic diversity upon, species selection and rotations to enhance and climate-proof forest carbon stocks (considering both in situ carbon sequestration and carbon storage in long-lived wood products) and sinks, while considering the broad range of other forest values and ecosystem services.
Consider the dynamics of the carbon stored in the different pools (above-ground biomass, below-ground biomass, deadwood, litter, soil organic carbon fractions, harvested wood products) under different forest management regimes and at different scales (EU-wide, national, local) to identify possible adaptations to current European models of sustainable forest management, so that the forest-based sector can optimise climate action, and to facilitate the monitoring and reporting of GHG emissions.
Improve the integration of European forests, including forest practices, in global and regional climate modelling.
Contribute to progress in the certification and authenticity verification of carbon removals that are nature-based (i.e. through forest protection, afforestation and sustainable forest management) or through the forest biomass used for longer-lived and higher-substitution products.
Design and monitor the efficacy of forest-based mitigation plans, combining the growing potential of satellite-based remote sensing with surface monitoring.
Develop recommendations for up-take in practice, including specifying which silvicultural measures to apply to which types of forest in order to maximise their mitigation potential while ensuring the provision of other ecosystem services, under the current and future climate, while fully respecting ecological principles favourable to biodiversity and soil conservation.
Analyse socio-economic aspects of forest-based mitigation strategies, including forest managers’ and users’ perception and factors influencing their decision making such as consumer choices, sectorial integration and international/domestic competition.
Improve knowledge on the environmental integrity, the social acceptability and the economic feasibility of forest-based mitigation actions such as afforestation, reforestation, forest restoration, forest protection, sustainable forest management and enhanced wood harvest and use, especially for long-lived products.
Proposals must implement the ‘multi-actor approach’ and should include a task to collaborate with other projects financed under the topic HORIZON-CL6-2022-CLIMATE-01-05: Forestry - European observatory of climate change impacts and demonstration network of climate smart restoration pilots.
This topic should involve effective contribution of SSH disciplines.

Deadline date","ExpectedOutcome:
The partnership is expected to contribute to all the following expected outcomes:
In line with the European Green Deal and the Convention on Biological Diversity, this partnership will contribute to the objectives and targets of the EU biodiversity strategy for 2030 under the overarching objective that, by 2030, biodiversity in Europe is back on the path to recovery. A successful proposal will contribute to the EU Green Deal priorities, the Birds and Habitats Directives, and to EU climate and agricultural policies. It will help connect biodiversity research across Europe, supporting and raising the ambition of national, EU and international environmental policies and conventions[1]. The expected outcomes of the topic will also contribute to other impacts of Destination ‘Biodiversity and ecosystem services’, as well as to the Commission priority 'A stronger Europe in the world', and to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 13, 14, 15, 17.
Biodiversity research and environmental policy institutions build up coherent initiatives through a co-funded European partnership.
National/local and EU research & innovation programmes share information between programmes and with environmental ministries and agencies, combining in-cash and in-kind resources. EU and national/regional biodiversity research agendas from EU Member States and associated countries- are complementary; a long-term pan-European strategic research agenda is co-created and implemented.
Biodiversity monitoring in Europe is structured in the form of a network of coordinated observatories providing accessible knowledge on biodiversity and ecosystem services to users via the EC Knowledge Centre for Biodiversity.
The partnership increases the relevance, impact and visibility of R&I and European leadership in tackling the biodiversity crisis.
Biodiversity is mainstreamed across sectors and policies across Europe by using tools such as natural capital accounting and by rolling out nature-based solutions, including traditional and new technologies, which provide multifunctional and resilient solutions to complex societal challenges.
Scope:
The European partnership on biodiversity ‘Rescuing biodiversity to safeguard life on Earth’ is one of the actions included in the EU biodiversity strategy for 2030. It should coordinate research programmes between EU and its Member States and associated countries and trigger combined action. For the first time, it should mobilise environmental authorities as key partners in carrying out biodiversity research and innovation, along with ministries of research, funding agencies, and environmental protection agencies. The partnership’s co-created strategic research and innovation agenda for seven years should include calls for research projects, biodiversity- and ecosystems monitoring and science-based policy advisory activities.
The partnership and its members should be committed to the Global 2050 Vision of ‘Living in harmony with nature’ adopted under the Convention on Biological Diversity - by 2050, biodiversity and its benefits to people should be protected, valued and restored. The long-term goals in the zero-draft of the post-2020 global biodiversity framework, adding up to this 2050 Vision include:
net zero ecosystem loss by 2030, with a decreased risk of species extinction risks decreasing, and an increase in abundance of endangered species and their genetic diversity;
rolling out of nature-based solutions at sufficient scale to contribute to people’s and environmental needs across Europe;
good biodiversity status fully acknowledged as one of the basis for sustainable development and a green economy, and EU/AC leadership is recognised in this context.
To reach these long-term goals, the Biodiversity Partnership should support the contribution of R&I to the EU biodiversity strategy to 2030 to enable transformative change that puts biodiversity on the path to recovery by 2030, for the benefit of the climate and people.
The partnership should aim to achieve five overarching objectives:
Produce actionable knowledge to tackle both the direct and indirect drivers of biodiversity loss; produce knowledge on biodiversity status, trends and dynamics, and in integrating drivers, pressures, impacts and responses; produce knowledge on the trade-offs and synergies between multiple drivers of biodiversity change; and an assessment of new tools and approaches to biodiversity/ecosystem conservation and restoration;
Expand and improve the evidence base, accelerate the development and wide deployment of nature-based solutions to meet societal challenges across Europe in a sustainable and resilient way, contributing to protecting biodiversity while tackling multiple challenges such as the climate crisis while improving food and nutrition security, the water supply, addressing flooding and water scarcity, and tackling other societal priorities.
Making the business case for the conservation and restoration of ecosystems, by contributing science-based methodologies to account for and possibly value ecosystem services and the natural capital, and to assess the dependency and impact of businesses on biodiversity.
Improved monitoring of biodiversity and ecosystem services across Europe (status and trends), building on existing national/regional monitoring schemes, building new capacity for setting up new schemes, promoting new and efficient technologies and experience from processes related to mapping and assessing ecosystems and their services (MAES) with regard to enhancing and standardising tools for mapping and assessment.
Science-based support for EU, Member States and associated countries policy-making, including for strengthening and implementing environmental policies and laws, and improving cross-sectoral links synergies with other European sectoral policies. More generally, R&I programmes should be better linked to the policy arena, providing greater input to policy making and improving the assessment of policy efficiency. The European partnership for biodiversity should be implemented through a joint programme of activities ranging from research to coordination and networking, including training, demonstration and dissemination, to be structured along the following main work streams:
Actions to promote and support R&I programs and projects across the European Research Area, including launching ambitious joint calls to fund transnational R&I projects and run mobility schemes, for example for young scientists or between academia and business;
Actions to build R&I capacity and increase the impact of R&I programmes and projects, including science-based policy support;
Actions to support, harmonise and carry out biodiversity monitoring;
Measures to improve the uptake, demonstration and rollout of solutions to tackle the above-mentioned objectives of the partnership;
Measures to enhance the excellence, visibility and impact of European R&I at international level.
Measures to regularly update the partnership vision and strategy.
The composition of the partnership should include at least a geographically representative distribution of national and regional research and innovation authorities and funding agencies, environmental authorities, and environmental agencies from EU Member States, associated countries and their regions. The number of partners and their contribution should be sufficient to attain a critical mass in the field. Partners are expected to provide financial and/or in-kind contribution, in line with the level of ambition of the proposed measures. The partnership should be open to including new partners over the lifetime of the partnership. Its governance should create a clear and transparent process for engaging with a broad range of stakeholders, together with the full members of the partnership, to ensure that the work strategically covers a wide range of views in the field of biodiversity, nature-based solutions and ecosystem services throughout the lifetime of the partnership. To ensure that all work streams are coherent and complementary, and to leverage knowledge investment potential, the partnership is expected to foster close cooperation and synergies with the Horizon Missions on Soils; Ocean, seas and waters; Climate Adaptation and Cities; and with the future European Partnerships Agroecology, Urban Transitions, Agriculture of Data, Water, Blue Economy, and Circular/Bio-based economy. The partnership should collaborate closely with the EC ‘Knowledge Centre for Biodiversity’[2] recently launched by the EC to build the expertise in Europe to inform, track and assess progress in implementing the EU 2030 biodiversity strategy and to underpin further biodiversity policy developments. It should also cooperate with the Science Service project under Horizon Europe[3], which is embedded into the EC ‘Knowledge Centre for Biodiversity’ and aims to facilitate the inclusion of research results into action to implement biodiversity policies.
The partnership should allocate resources to cooperate with existing projects, initiatives, platforms, science-policy interfaces, institutional processes at EU level, and at other levels where relevant to the partnership’s goals. Proposals should pool the necessary financial resources from participating national (or regional) research programmes with a view to implementing joint calls for transnational proposals that provide grants to third parties.
Applicants are expected to describe in detail how they would carry out this collaborative work in practice. Given the global dimension of biodiversity, membership and other modalities of participation from institutions in non-EU countries is encouraged. In particular, the participation of legal entities from international countries and/or regions including those not automatically eligible for funding is encouraged in the joint calls.
Proposals should pool the necessary financial resources from participating national (or regional) research programmes with a view to implementing joint calls for transnational proposals that provide grants to third parties.
Financial support provided by the participants to third parties is one of the primary channels under this action to enable the partnership to achieve its objectives. The maximum amount to be granted to each third party is EUR 7 million for the whole duration of Horizon Europe. It is expected that the partnership organises joint calls on an annual base from 2022-2027 and therefore it should factor ample time to run the co-funded projects.
This topic should involve contributions from the social sciences and humanities disciplines.
The Commission envisages to include new actions in future work programme(s) to continue providing support to the partnership for the duration of Horizon Europe.

Deadline date","ExpectedOutcome:
The project is expected to connect up biodiversity research across Europe, supporting and enhancing the ambition of national, European and international environmental policies and conventions.
Contributing to the EU biodiversity strategy for 2030, the aim of this topic is to give support for developing and implementing this and other EU policies by generating knowledge generation, guiding biodiversity governance and ecosystem monitoring, and implementing the EU Green Deal. It supports the development of a long-term strategic research agenda for biodiversity.
The project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:
a single entry point linking European research and biodiversity policymaking that will be embedded in the EC Knowledge Centre for Biodiversity (KCBD) as ‘scientific pillar’, which will collect and organise knowledge resulting from science that is relevant for implementing the EU biodiversity strategy and other relevant EU policies, in particular knowledge generated from EU-funded R&I projects, relevant infrastructures and platforms.
feeding input into the monitoring, reporting and review mechanism of the EU biodiversity strategy for 2030 with relevant research-based assessments and options that can feed into any short- and medium-term corrective action necessary (“ratcheting up”).
full integration into, and support to the governance framework of the EU biodiversity strategy for 2030 to steer implementation of the commitments on biodiversity agreed at national, European or international level.
setting up a functional, early delivering Science Service at EU level, also involving associated countries where appropriate, to bolster at global level the EU’s ambitions for research into biodiversity-relevant areas.
Scope:
The EU biodiversity strategy for 2030 announced a science policy mechanism for research-based options to ratchet up the implementation of commitments made on biodiversity. This topic is to provide a Science Service as a dedicated tool to regularly integrate science into EU biodiversity policy-making in terms of what is needed to implement the strategy. It should bridge the continued and critical gap on knowledge sharing and should complement other EU-funded initiatives[1]. It should feed into the EC Knowledge Centre for Biodiversity[2]. At the same time, it should provide a single-entry point linking RTD funded research and innovation with biodiversity policymaking via the EC Knowledge Centre for Biodiversity. Further, the Science Service might act as a pilot on how any science component could work in practice in the context of the post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework. With this work, Europe could test and lead the way on how to make such an instrument, triggering research-based options to implement the biodiversity strategy, work in practice.
The objective is to reformat and connect research results to the needs of environmental policy in a targeted dialogue between science and policy makers. This should include science resulting from the latest EU R&I activities and infrastructures, shape future R&I and be embedded in the long-term strategic research agenda on biodiversity. Proposals should develop a Science Service mechanism that covers all of the following aspects:
Inspired by IPBES functions, it should provide relevant policy tools (e.g. indicators), generate knowledge to fill gaps, build capacity within and beyond the EU, and contribute to science-based assessments for the EU decision-making process.
All work carried out by the Science Service should be defined under strong and clear governance arrangements, including how to prioritise requests, and designed to support implementing, monitoring, reporting and reviewing the EU biodiversity strategy. The governance should be led by DG RTD, in cooperation with DG ENV, DG JRC and the EEA, and ideally involve the Environmental Knowledge Community (EKC)[3] and factor in its needs and requests.
The Science Service should feed into the EC Knowledge Centre on Biodiversity[4] and support it to direct knowledge gaps and policy questions to science, synthesize knowledge, and communicate emerging issues identified by science to decision-makers in policy, business, NGOs, land users or site managers. The Science Service should also be involved and feed knowledge into strategic dialogues and fora organised by the EC Knowledge Centre for Biodiversity, as well as in expert meetings requested by the EKC. The Knowledge Centre on Biodiversity should manage exchanges from policy to science and vice-versa, and the Science Service constitutes its primary tool for making scientific information accessible to policy makers.
Member States, and where appropriate associated countries, civil society and the Mission Boards under Horizon Europe, may also ask the Science Service to cover specific topics. The process of directing requests for contents and format to the Science Service, and how to provide information, is to be agreed with the relevant EU services, including with the EC Knowledge Centre for Biodiversity.
The Science Service should use the tools and results funded by the EU research framework programmes[5], by other sources of European funding[6], and additional relevant sources[7], which it should help integrate into the EC Knowledge Centre for Biodiversity. It should cooperate with the European partnership on biodiversity[8].
The Science Service should take up requests from biodiversity policy-making to the Biodiversity Partnership, and to the biodiversity-relevant missions in Horizon Europe. This would be orchestrated in collaboration with the EC Knowledge Centre for Biodiversity; such as via its user forum function. The Science service should also organise ad-hoc high-level expert advice to the European Commission’s high-level decision-makers on specific issues related to biodiversity.
The work of the Science Service should be presented and discussed at expert or working groups according to the governance framework of the EU biodiversity strategy, and should support European research policy related to biodiversity. It should also act as a ‘back office’ for organising the cooperation of biodiversity-relevant research projects – in thematic clusters where appropriate – under Horizon Europe and Horizon 2020, such as yearly meetings or through common products, in collaboration with the Executive Agency. This would be done in collaboration with the EC Knowledge Centre for Biodiversity.
The Science Service should support the orchestration of current and future knowledge mechanisms to implement the long-term European strategic biodiversity research agenda, including work under the Biodiversity Partnership and other biodiversity-relevant partnerships; such as EKLIPSE, Oppla, NetworkNature, the EC Knowledge Centre for Biodiversity[2] and other biodiversity-relevant science advisory mechanisms. It should also describe the global aspects of its services in the mid-term planning.
Proposals should indicate what specific results the Science Service should initially deliver by the end of year one. This pilot exercise should be relevant to and fit the timeframe set out in the policy agenda of the EU biodiversity strategy, and optionally, for the global biodiversity agenda. Throughout the duration of the project, the following annual work plans should be aligned to the long-term strategic research agenda (in preparation - See EU biodiversity strategy).
The Service should then deliver, communicate and disseminate regular (e.g. half-yearly) input in the form of options and scenarios for implementing the biodiversity strategy for 2030 and beyond. The aim must be to trigger response from those entities responsible for implementing the strategy (e.g. EU services, national and local authorities, business, civil society and the environmental knowledge community in general).
It should provide, on request of its governance bodies, summaries, knowledge synthesis, factsheets or briefs and reviews of biodiversity research outputs and tools usable for implementing and ratcheting up the EU biodiversity strategy, in language and format tailored to the target users, such as:
foresight, analysis of new and emerging topics,
indicators and valuation methods,
analysis of the behavioural, institutional and bio-physical factors for biodiversity conservation and restoration, including on tipping points and planetary boundaries,
projections/forecasts, integrated models, scenarios and pathways that integrate socio-economic and cultural values, that avoid lock-in pathways, and that provide incentives for large-scale demonstration of nature-based solutions and testing of governance approaches, financing and business models to enable transformative change,
requests to existing science-policy services (such as EKLIPSE and Oppla) in collaboration with the EC Knowledge Centre for Biodiversity for dedicated biodiversity-relevant science-policy tasks that those services can deliver, and that the Science Service channels into the biodiversity governance framework,
support for science-based decision-making for biodiversity against disinformation campaigns; and
testing new ways of communicating biodiversity-related science to non-scientific audiences.
Proposals should describe how the Science Service can deliver its work in line with the timeframe for policy processes and to implement the EU biodiversity strategy. They should explain how they have sufficient resources, and a flexible, lean mechanism following the principles of credibility, relevance and legitimacy, including whether internal assessments or peer reviews on its outputs are planned.
Proposals should evaluate the experience of comparable instruments covering some of the actions or procedures that the Science Service should set up[10], focused on biodiversity but also in other fields, and under the governance framework of the EU biodiversity strategy.
The project should draw up a plan on how to finance and govern the activities of this kick-starting service over the medium- and long-term and seek to secure commitments to allow the work of the Science Service to continue after the funding of this topic ends, i.e. before 2027.
Proposals should strike an appropriate geographical balance across Europe.
This topic should involve contributions from the sciences and humanities disciplines.

Deadline date","ExpectedOutcome:
In line with the European Green Deal priorities, the farm to fork strategy for a fair, healthy and environment‑friendly food system, and the EU’s climate ambition for 2030 and 2050, the successful proposal will support R&I to promote the production, provision and safe consumption of alternative sources of protein, and dietary shifts towards sustainable healthy nutrition, contributing to the transformation of food systems to deliver co‑benefits for climate (mitigation and adaptation), biodiversity, environmental sustainability and circularity, sustainable healthy nutrition and safe food, food poverty reduction, empowerment of communities, and thriving businesses.
The farm to fork strategy states that ‘[a] key area of research will relate to (…) increasing the availability and source of alternative proteins such as plant, microbial, marine and insect-based proteins and meat substitutes’.
While information already exists on the environmental and climate-related benefits of a dietary shift to alternative proteins, more R&I is needed to obtain a comprehensive and up‑to‑date understanding of the environmental footprint and sustainability performance of alternatives (e.g. plant-based, microbe-based, ocean-based (i.e. fish, algae, invertebrates), fungus-based, insect-based, cultured meat) compared to conventional sources of protein (e.g. meat and dairy) and dietary shifts. There is also a need for further research on the positive and negative impacts of alternative protein sources in European diets on human health (e.g. food allergies) and their bioavailability (along with other characteristics such as structure, colour, taste and flavour). It is presumed that a shift to alternative proteins should lead to healthier and overall more sustainable diets, but this depends on the nature of the shift (e.g. shifting from processed meat to another nutrient‑poor, highly processed protein source might not provide the desired health benefits).
Projects results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:
informing a systemic approach to integrated food policy development and informing sectoral policies (e.g. on food safety, public health, agriculture, aquaculture and the environment) through additional, up-to-date information and knowledge on alternative sources of protein and dietary shift; and
providing solutions and assessing their potential for fighting climate change (through adaptation and mitigation), halting biodiversity loss and improving ecosystem services, promoting the circularity of the food system and improving people’s health and well‑being through more nutritious, healthier and overall sustainable food systems and food choices.
Scope:
Many studies (e.g. IPCC, EAT-Lancet) have highlighted the large environmental impact of traditional livestock production and consumption of products thereof, and the need for and benefits of a dietary shift to alternative protein sources. For example, switching from meat and dairy to alternative sources of protein could lead to savings in land use (plant alternatives need less land per unit of protein; aquatic animals generally have a high production per area), better animal welfare and less deforestation for food production. Excessive consumption of livestock-derived products could also lead to a decline in health. The World Health Organization (WHO) has classified processed meat as carcinogenic to humans and red meat as probably carcinogenic to humans. An Oxford University model specifies that switching to diets made of alternative protein sources (e.g. algae, insects, plants, fungi) reduces diet‑related mortality by 5-7%, due to increased consumption of dietary fibres[1]. However, a concern regarding novel foods (especially those containing proteins) is the likelihood of food allergies.
Proposals are expected to address the following:
consider all alternative sources of protein (e.g. plant-based, microbe-based, ocean‑based (i.e. fish, algae, invertebrates), fungus-based, insect-based, cultured meat), including their processing, and avoid focusing on only one, so as to enable comparison;
fill knowledge gaps and improve our understanding of the positive and negative impacts of each type of alternative protein and the overall dietary shift with respect to the environment, natural resources, biodiversity and climate (considering global aspects, pedo‑climatic and biogeographical conditions, pollution pressure and trade issues);
fill knowledge gaps on the characteristics of each type of alternative protein, including nutritional quality (e.g. bioavailability, the quality of the protein itself and of combined protein sources), alone and in the context of its introduction in European diets (taking into account the cultural aspects of diets and national dietary advice in the EU);
fill knowledge gaps on the health impact of alternative proteins and overall dietary shift in the European Union, in particular for those sources of proteins for which limited information on health impacts is available, such as (but not limited to) invertebrates or insects-based proteins (e.g. allergies, compliance with nutrient‑based and food‑based dietary guidelines and recommended dietary patterns), while considering gender aspects, and other safety aspects (e.g. not cytotoxic, no toxic aggregates or excessive amount of toxic substances);
conduct a comparative systemic analysis of conventional and alternative proteins. New Product Environmental Footprint (PEF)-based categories should be created and health effects should be included in diet assessment frameworks. Non-linear effects should be studied, with regard to both consumption and production;
highlight the need for new future-proof technologies and anticipate potential issues in relation to resource availability, pollution and societal acceptability;
create or contribute to a data space to gather knowledge, information and results of studies, and share them openly (open science) among research communities, interested parties and the public (dietary data hub). Seek interactions and complementarities with the data space for R&I and the European Open Science Cloud, and contribute to increasing the level of FAIRness (Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability and Re-usability) of dietary data;
clearly explain how they will contribute to the farm to fork objectives and deliver co-benefits on each of the Food 2030 priorities: nutrition for sustainable healthy diets, climate and environment, circularity and resource efficiency, innovation and empowering communities (e.g. meeting the needs, values and expectations of society in a responsible and ethical way); and
implement the multi-actor approach by involving a wide range of food system actors and conducting inter-disciplinary research. Proposals should also promote international cooperation. Where relevant, activities should build and expand on the results of past and ongoing research projects (especially the four projects funded under topic LC-SFS-17-2019: Alternative proteins for food and feed). Projects should have a clear plan as to how they will collaborate with other projects selected under this topic (if funding of more than one project is possible) and topic HORIZON‑CL6‑2021-FARM2FORK-01-02: Developing sustainable and competitive land‑based protein crop systems and value chains. They should participate in joint activities, workshops, focus groups or social labs, and common communication and dissemination activities, and show potential for upscaling. Applicants should plan the necessary budget to cover these activities. The possible participation of the JRC in the projects will also ensure that the proposed approach will be compatible with and/or improve existing databases and tools used at the European Commission with regard to the environmental aspects, and ensure open access to data.
This topic should involve the effective contribution of SSH disciplines.

","single-stage
Deadline date","ExpectedOutcome:
In line with the European Green Deal priorities, the farm to fork strategy for a fair, healthy and environmentally friendly food system, and the EU's climate ambition for 2030 and 2050, the successful proposal will support R&I to prevent and reduce food loss and waste, contributing to the transformation of food systems to deliver co-benefits for climate (mitigation and adaptation), biodiversity, environmental sustainability and circularity, dietary shift, sustainable healthy nutrition and safe food, food poverty reduction and the empowerment of communities.
Projects results are expected to contribute to all the following outcomes:
More timely and responsive decision-making on food waste prevention and reduction by any actor seeking to implement a food waste prevention or reduction initiative, based on new, comprehensive and easily accessible evidence of the impact and cost-effectiveness of different measures and behaviours at different levels and across different sectors, including consumers;
Food companies engage more and more effectively in food waste prevention and reduction activities.
Scope:
Food loss and waste has negative impacts on society, the environment and the economy: it contributes to food insecurity and hinders nutrition; generates greenhouse gas emissions and creates pressure on land and water, including deforestation, degradation of natural habitats and biodiversity loss; it is also responsible for great economic losses. Such negative impacts are exacerbated in times of crisis (e.g. COVID-19), when food supply‑chain disruptions generate additional food losses and wastes.
Reducing the amount of food intended for human consumption that is eventually lost or wasted represents a complex challenge, as it involves changing established business practices and people’s habits, while guaranteeing the safety of food. As demonstrated by UNEP Food Waste Index Report 2021[1] , food is wasted mainly towards the end of the supply chain (particularly at consumption level, in households and food services). Here, consumer behaviour and the lack of awareness and coordination between actors in the supply chain play a key role. An additional issue directly linked with loss and waste is the amount of packaging that is eventually discarded with – or without – the food.
Successful proposals are expected to address two complementary areas:
Area A:
Developing a comprehensive evidence-based analysis of food loss and waste prevention actions, with the overall aim of informing decision-making. In particular, this should involve an impact assessment and cost-benefit analysis of existing food waste prevention actions in the EU and its associated countries, and of their economic, environmental and social impacts. This should include developing a database of actions and tools for preventing and reducing food waste and loss, which will help inform future interventions by different stakeholders and promote replicability across countries.
The development of sector-specific guidance sharing the key success factors, barriers and data for an effective prevention and reduction of food losses and waste is also recommended.
Area B:
Supporting research (i.e. development of an evidence base) and innovation (with a special focus on open and social innovation) on existing social norms responsible for food waste, so as to foster appropriate changes in consumer behaviour and business practices (e.g. marketing standards, retail and trade practices, restaurant portion sizes).
This will involve gathering new evidence on the feasibility of innovations that are tailored to specific contexts.
On consumer behaviour, the investigation should include analysis of current trends and correlations as regards:
Food waste and convenience food (i.e. ready to eat);
Food waste at household level and food services (i.e. eating out/take away);
Food waste, obesity and malnutrition;
Food waste and crisis response policies (e.g. case of COVID-19).
As regards food businesses, this activity should support innovative and/or improved business practices in large companies and SMEs that:
Effectively signal the value of food, so as to reduce food waste;
Redesign portion sizes to reduce food waste;
Operationalize food waste reduction and prevention though internal corporate policies and business strategies with supply chain actors.
The expected behavioural change should also be supported by new or specifically adapted technologies in both of the following areas: date marking and sustainable and smart food packaging.
Successful proposals should build on the work of the Commission’s Joint Research Centre in support of the EU Platform on Food Losses and Food Waste, and be in line with the Commission’s environmental footprint method[2], [3], especially as regards to the life-cycle assessment.
Successful proposals should deliver on food waste reduction and prevention across the food system. They should explain how they will deliver co-benefits to the Food 2030 priorities (nutrition for sustainable healthy diets, climate and environment, circularity and resource efficiency, and innovation and empowerment of communities).
The required multi-actor approach (see eligibility conditions) will be implemented by conducting inter- and trans-disciplinary research and involving a wide range of food system actors, with special attention to consumers and civil society organisations.
Proposals should develop compelling communication products, potentially two-way communication activities for each relevant food system actor and an innovative science education package for schools. They are encouraged to build on past or ongoing EU-funded research and collaborate with relevant initiatives, including the Commission’s Platform for Food Losses and Waste. They should set out a clear plan on how they will cluster with other proposals selected under this and any other relevant topic, e.g. by participating in joint activities, workshops, and common communication and dissemination activities.
Social innovation is recommended when the solution is at the socio-technical interface and requires social change, new social practices, social ownership or market uptake.
Proposals should address inequalities, be they due to gender, race or other social categories. This topic should involve the effective contribution of SSH disciplines.

The successful proposal will be in line with the European Green Deal priorities and the farm to fork strategy for a fair healthy and environmentally friendly food system, as well as with the EU's Climate ambition for 2030 and 2050. It will support R&I to foster advances in research related to microorganisms for safer, healthier and more environmentally friendly food processing. This is along with contributing to the transformation of food systems to deliver co-benefits for climate (mitigation and adaptation), biodiversity, environmental sustainability and circularity, dietary shift, sustainable healthy nutrition and safe food, food poverty reduction and empowerment of communities, and thriving businesses.
Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:
A furthering of open access provision for the necessary standardisation, identification, and mapping techniques of existing and potential beneficial microorganisms, and microbial consortia for use in food processing, which providing an assessment of their benefits with respect to nutrition, health, food safety, circularity, and sustainability.
Knowledge from the assessment of the economic, societal and environmental importance of fermented foods and of their role in transition from animal to vegetable proteins.
Advanced knowledge on what can be considered a healthy human microbiota and the conditions (for example diet and treatments) under which this equilibrium is disrupted.
Further knowledge on fermentation-based solutions for food products and processes, such as improved nutritional, structural, and functional properties, and enhanced food preservation.
Scope:
There is evidence that beneficial bacteria and other microorganisms can lead to a healthy animal and human gut microbiome, that microbiomes can improve food quality and safety (incl. tailored food) as well as the nutritional value of aliments/food, contributing to more sustainable food systems. The rupture of the human microbiome symbiotic relationship could also be associated to more health disorders and the cause of chronic diseases, and that food is an essential lever to maintain symbiosis by promoting optimal intestinal microbial diversity and restoring healthy microbiome profiles and functionality. An expected outcome of this topic is the further scientific underpinning, verification and elucidation of these investigative pathways through evidence driven research and innovation.
In this context food based on microbial fermentation needs further investigation as it currently accounts for 5 to 40% of our diet (country depending) yet we still know little of its role in the human digestive system after ingestion. Further research should provide sustainable dietary strategies based on microbe-fermented foods aiming to improve human health and sustainability of dietary patterns, and help in determining any possible role in metabolic disease control. Food fermented by microorganisms and food ingredients produced by them also have huge innovation potential, in particular for SMEs, for local development, and as a way of minimizing food waste from non-optimal raw material, waste products from food manufacturing, or seasonal overproduction.
Activities should develop applicable solutions, in particular for the food processing industry, and in the utilisation of fermentation potential. New products may seek EU market regulatory approval, thus proposals should consider and address relevant regulatory requirements as well as EFSA guidance documents for specific safety testing and risk assessment protocols.
Proposals are expected to address the following:
Understand the interaction of microbial biodiversity, mechanisms between fermented foods, different types of food microbiomes, and the human microbiomes in order to determine the role of fermented food in nutrition, health and diet diversification.
Develop applicable solutions for the food processing industry utilizing microbial potential in the production of food ingredients, and nutrients including formulation into food products.
Develop new tests to evaluate the condition of the symbiosis between humans and microbiotas used routinely in pro- and diagnostics.
Using microbes to reduce food packaging, food processing inputs (e.g.: energy, water), chemicals used in food (production), while ensuring the increased lifespan and safety of the products and the benefits to human and animal health.
Activate societal engagement with relevant stakeholders (e.g. farmers, civil society organisations, regulatory bodies, citizens and media outlets) in order to ensure product acceptability and labelling in compliance with the relevant legal framework.
Proposals should explain how they will deliver co-benefits to the four Food 2030 priorities: nutrition for sustainable healthy diets, climate and environment, circularity and resource efficiency, innovation and empowerment of communities as well as those relevant to different socio-economic and cultural groups.
Proposals must implement the multi-actor approach by involving a wide diversity of food system actors and conducting inter- and trans-disciplinary research engaging consumers, consumer organizations and civil society organisations and including local and indigenous knowledge of soils. Proposals are encouraged to build on past or ongoing EU-funded research, research infrastructures and collaborate with relevant initiatives, including the Horizon Europe Soil Health and Food Mission. International cooperation (such as the International Bioeconomy Forum) is highly recommended. Proposals should include a clear plan on how they will collaborate with other proposals selected under this and any other relevant topic, by participating in joint activities, workshops, as well as common communication and dissemination activities. Proposals should plan the necessary budget to cover these activities.

It will contribute to the transformation of food systems to deliver co-benefits for climate (mitigation and adaptation), biodiversity, environmental sustainability and circularity, dietary shift, sustainable healthy nutrition and safe food, food poverty reduction and empowerment of communities, and thriving businesses.
The main objective of this topic is to understand better, and measure, factors influencing dietary behaviour. It also seeks to support the development of innovative, effective tools and strategies to facilitate the transition towards healthy and sustainable dietary behaviour and self-management of dietary habits.
Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following outcomes:
improved knowledge and understanding of the factors influencing the dietary behaviour of different target groups (in particular vulnerable groups) across Europe, including barriers and constraints;
identification of effective means whereby each food system actor can foster behavioural change;
enabling consumers to make informed food choices;
a scientific basis for dietary advice to support policymakers and Member States that will empower individuals to adopt healthy and sustainable dietary behaviours, choices and lifestyles, as a win-win for their health and the environment, building on the advice of competent bodies at national, EU and international levels; and
a better scientific basis on which policymakers could develop communication strategies that would increase the acceptability of food and health policy interventions by all actors and sectors that aim to support a shift towards healthy and sustainable diets for all, bearing in mind that education and dietary advice is a national competence.
Scope:
Changes in food production, processing and consumption patterns have contributed to diet-related health problems worldwide[1]. Non-communicable diseases (NCDs) such as cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), cancer, obesity, chronic respiratory diseases and diabetes account for 71% of all deaths. NCDs are largely preventable through effective interventions that tackle shared risk factors such as unhealthy diet, physical inactivity, tobacco use and the abuse of alcohol. According to the EAT-Lancet Commission, a shift from current diets to healthier diets is likely to benefit human health substantially, averting about 11 million deaths per year. Long-lasting, healthy and sustainable dietary behaviour needs to be given high priority from an early age, as good eating habits are usually formed in childhood.
The change of dietary behaviour is a complex challenge subject to manifold influences that should be better understood at individual and system levels, and through public engagement and inter-/trans-disciplinary approaches. The development of new approaches/strategies/tools requires a systemic approach involving all the main actors at different levels, who can ensure acceptance of and better adherence to healthy and sustainable dietary behaviour. These include governmental and public authorities, healthcare providers, education systems from schools to universities, (local) producers, the food industry, retailers, hospitality and food services, non‑governmental consumer and patient organisations, the general public, policymakers and the media.
Proposals should consider a range of geographical, socio-economic, behavioural and cultural factors and aim to produce innovative and effective strategies, tools and/or programmes promoting sustainable and healthy dietary behaviours and lifestyles to be used by policymakers, and monitoring approaches for measuring progress towards these goals if policymakers decide to implement such strategies, tools and/or programmes. The gender dimension (possible physical and behavioural differences) should also be investigated. Data collected and integrated by the private and public sectors should be broken down by gender and age.
Where relevant, activities should build and expand on the results of past and ongoing research projects, and input from national, EU and international competent bodies. Selected projects under this topic (and under the topic HORIZON-HLTH-2022-STAYHLTH-01-05-two-stage: Prevention of obesity throughout the life course) are strongly encouraged to participate in joint activities as appropriate, possibly in the form of project clustering, workshops, etc. Proposals are expected to demonstrate support for common coordination and dissemination activities. Applicants should plan the necessary budget to cover such activities.
Proposals are expected to address the following:
map and monitor dietary patterns at national/regional/rural/(sub)urban levels relevant to different genders, socio-economic and cultural groups, including the most vulnerable, to provide a snapshot of the situation across Europe;
identify, involve and analyse different population groups, in particular the most vulnerable, and the health and environment impact of their choices, in order potentially to enable them to benefit from the outcome of the project;
understand and measure the impacts of the factors and incentives influencing individual and collective dietary choice and behaviour across Europe;
improve our understanding of the barriers and enabling factors affecting food system actors’ efforts to improve food environments and to produce, process, promote and provide healthier and environmentally, socially and economically sustainable food products/processes/services to respond to citizens’ needs/demands;
for specific groups, develop innovative actions/approaches/interventions for different countries, region, urban and rural areas that policymakers could use to facilitate the transition towards healthy and sustainable dietary behaviour and lifestyle, and evaluate the effective impact if those would be implemented;
develop innovative and effective tools to improve education, communication, engagement and training on sustainable healthy nutrition and diets, and on sustainable food systems, adapted to different population groups in respect of cultures, needs and gender at different levels (e.g. public authorities, health care providers, education systems). The tools should be available to the responsible national authorities, to support their efforts on health promotion, disease prevention and care;
develop science-based tools for translating the scientific evidence base into easy-to-understand food-based dietary guidelines by national competent authorities that take account of local, seasonal, cultural, social, ethical, health and environmental factors and help consumers to make informed, responsible and easy choices;
fill knowledge gaps and update the scientific evidence base to provide support for national authorities developing dietary guidelines for specific population groups (using the basis provided by national, EU and international competent bodies);
provide recommendations for policymakers, underpinned by scientific evidence, to facilitate the transition towards healthy personalised management and sustainable dietary behaviour and lifestyle; and
provide evidence-based cost-benefit analysis of the proposed measure(s).
The multi-actor approach (see eligibility conditions) will be implemented by involving a wide range of food system actors and conducting inter-/trans-disciplinary research. Proposals should bring together multiple types of scientific expertise in health and natural sciences, and social sciences and humanities. This topic should involve the effective contribution of SSH disciplines.
Social innovation is recommended when the solution is at the socio-technical interface and requires social change, new social practices, social ownership or market uptake.

In line with the European Green Deal priorities and the farm to fork strategy for a fair, healthy and environment-friendly food system, the successful proposal will support R&I to increase transparency across food systems to boost health, sustainability and safety of products, processes and diets, contributing to the transformation of food systems to deliver co-benefits for climate (mitigation and adaptation), environmental sustainability and circularity, dietary shift, sustainable healthy nutrition and safe food, food poverty reduction and empowerment of communities, and thriving businesses.
Advances in R&I to upgrade transparency will provide multiple benefits relevant to improving food safety, fighting food fraud and addressing growing public concern in the EU as regards the climate, biodiversity and environmental impacts of food and diets in practice.
Projects results are expected to contribute to all following expected outcomes:
accelerate the deployment of transparency innovations and solutions in EU food systems, especially among micro-enterprises and SMEs, to boost health, sustainability, and safety of products, processes and diets, and drive climate action; and
ensure that future transparency innovations and solutions are demand-driven, systemic and cost-effective, and support the objectives of the EU farm to fork strategy and the EU Green Deal.
Scope:
Despite technological progress and the emergence of new approaches, solutions and methodologies, recent literature[1] highlights continuing challenges in increasing the uptake of transparency solutions among food system actors. These include concerns about connectivity, interoperability, privacy, cost-efficiency and low consumer confidence in the technologies being deployed. In addition, many point to the fragmentation and complexity of food systems, the high number of SMEs and micro-companies, and the cross-cutting and systemic nature of transparency innovations as important reasons for the slow deployment of the solutions.
Transparency (defined in supply chains as access to non-distorted, factual, relevant and timely information about supply chain products[2]) is a critical component of modern food systems. Transparency of food production from farm to fork is crucial to inform consumers, authorities and food system actors on product characteristics such as origin, production method, ingredients and safety, and on sustainability and ethical aspects of products and processes. It is also a crucial factor in ensuring food traceability and authenticity.
Proposals should accelerate the deployment of transparency solutions in EU food systems, especially among micro-enterprises and SMEs, to boost health, sustainability and safety of products, processes and diets in the period to 2030, and drive climate action. In particular, proposals should facilitate innovations that increase transparency in support of six objectives:
Improving the efficiency and effectiveness of traceability;
Making it easier for people to adopt healthy and sustainable diets with a lower environmental and climate impact, by advancing innovations that provide and process transparency data across the food chain to support the implementation of the future EU framework for sustainability labelling;
Making it easier for farmers and food businesses to increase the sustainability of their products and processes, and make them more nutrition-sensitive;
Drastically improving the efficiency and effectiveness of food safety processes and procedures, within companies and beyond;
Increasing the authenticity of products, and reducing food fraud; and
Increasing the capacity of authorities and policymakers that deal with food safety, sustainability, nutrition and health to monitor the performance of different parts and processes of the food system.
Proposals should build a network of expertise that can act as an EU hub for knowledge sharing and the demonstration and piloting of systemic solutions relating to transparency. The network should be governed by a wide range of experts and stakeholders, including primary producers, processors, retailers, food service providers, consumers, public and private institutions (governmental institutions, civil society, including NGOs, and industry), investors, entrepreneurs and policymakers.
Proposals should create an inventory of validated technologies (such as IoT, blockchain, artificial intelligence, 5G/edge, and ‘big data’), open data, approaches and methodologies based on past research and emerging best practice. They should demonstrate the use of these technologies to address the above objectives using existing or emerging data infrastructures across the food chain. They should make a particular effort to valorise relevant past EU-funded research.
Proposals should consolidate the state of play as regards approaches for dealing effectively with cross-cutting challenges (e.g. connectivity, privacy, interoperability, consumer acceptance, cost-effectiveness, skills) and address the lack of such approaches where needed and in line with the relevant legal frameworks.
Proposals should widely disseminate and communicate expertise among primary producers, processors, retailers, food service providers, public and private institutions (governmental institutions, NGOs, industry), investors, entrepreneurs and policymakers. In this way, they should build awareness, education and skills on at European level in a way that supports solution development in practice in major food categories, by taking into account EU, national, regional and sectoral contexts and needs (health, food & nutrition policies, environmental, socioeconomic, cultural, gender-related, behavioural and dietary).
Proposals should develop methodologies, tools and approaches to enable the clients of the network of expertise to engage actively with end-users of transparency solutions (e.g. retailers, public authorities), a broad range of food system actors, technology and infrastructure providers and policymakers, to make sure that new transparency solutions are demand-driven, systemic, in line with the relevant legal frameworks, and cost-effective, and that they support the objectives of the EU farm to fork strategy, including the implementation of the future food sustainability labelling framework. Proposals are encouraged to assess the merits of existing and future citizen-science initiatives that can help build or uptake transparency solutions.
Proposals should help clients to apply systems thinking to identify challenges linked to the above objectives and possible innovative systemic solutions. They should help them understand and assess how transparency solutions will be used and how they will generate benefits and incentives for consumers and food businesses by enabling policy development (including the implementation of a future EU framework for sustainability labelling). They should stimulate mutual learning across parts of food systems, scientific disciplines, geographies and languages.
Proposals should perform these tasks using a business model that guarantees the functioning of the network and its services beyond the lifespan of the project.
In addition, proposals should develop and pilot cross-cutting and systemic solutions that improve transparency as regards one or more of the six objectives, while respecting the relevant legal frameworks and national competence in the area of diet and health, to complement and support the above tasks. The pilots should advance solutions that can benefit a wide range of micro-enterprises and SMEs. For the purpose of the pilots, proposals may involve financial support for third parties in the form of grants, typically in the order of EUR 100 000 to 300 000 per party. These amounts are deemed sufficient to ensure that solutions are demand-driven, systemic and cost-effective, and support the objectives of the EU farm to fork strategy and the EU Green Deal. Up to 20% of the EU funding requested by the proposal may be allocated to the purpose of financial support for third parties.
Proposals should explain and map how the pilots will achieve co-benefits relevant to the Food 2030 priorities (nutrition for sustainable healthy diets, climate and environment, circularity and resource efficiency, innovation and empowerment of communities).
Proposals should set out a clear plan on how they will collaborate with other projects selected under this and any other relevant topic, by participating in joint activities, and common communication and dissemination activities. Proposals are encouraged to link with relevant smart specialization platforms.
This topic should involve the effective contribution of SSH disciplines.

This topic aims at supporting activities that are enabling or contributing to one or several expected impacts of destination 3 “Tackling diseases and reducing disease burden”. To that end, proposals under this topic should aim for delivering results that are directed, tailored towards and contributing to all of the following expected outcomes:
Researchers continue to use the platform as an effective and sustained approach to coordinate and manage their efforts on the repurposing of medicines, making the best use of scientific knowledge and resources.
Patients have new and effective therapeutic options addressing unmet medical needs, both for communicable and non-communicable diseases.
Health care systems and payers have available more cost-effective treatments that reduce the financial burden in the medium- to long-term.
The public sector and the pharmaceutical industry engage in new models of sustainable collaboration, at European level and beyond.
Policy-makers adjust the EU’s regulatory landscape for pharmaceuticals towards further harmonisation and increased fitness for purpose.
Scope:
Development of therapeutics is a lengthy process that requires a large amount of efforts, time and financial resources. It is often burdened by delays and barriers that account for an average of almost 15 years until a promising candidate molecule becomes an approved medicine. It is therefore of paramount importance to define strategies that facilitate the reduction of timeframes, decrease costs and improve the success rate of this complex and lengthy process. One efficient strategy towards this direction is the repurposing of already approved medicinal products[1] and repositioning of investigational products[2] beyond their original indication. This approach has already proved successful[3] in several instances but its potential is far from having been fully exploited.
Proposals should address all of the following:
Set up a platform[4] supporting an innovative repurposing model with a harmonized and sustainable dimension in the EU, attracting investments and taking a position of leadership at global level. This model should integrate the scientific, methodological, financial, legal, regulatory, and intellectual property aspects of the repurposing approach.
Provide robust and transparent selection mechanisms for prioritising already approved medicinal products or investigational products for repurposing, based on recognized unmet medical needs and sound preliminary data, and identify research priorities for the better understanding of mechanisms of action.
Leverage, pool and share existing high quality data assets in the European repurposing landscape, also by using pharmacogenomics, in silico, and artificial intelligence (AI) approaches, innovative preclinical human in vitro cellular/multi-organ validation methods, and deliver new computational tools.
Resolve the fragmentation and lack of ownership of the repurposing approach that greatly impedes the efficient exploitation of its potential, networking existing projects[5] and initiatives in the field. Particular attention should be given in supporting and strengthening academic driven research.
Devise and test a European innovation platform to enhance the collaboration among relevant European stakeholders, including academia, non-profit organisations, patients, health-care professionals, regulators, health technology assessment bodies, payers, industry, and European Research Infrastructures.
All projects funded under this topic are strongly encouraged to participate in networking and joint activities, as appropriate. These networking and joint activities could, for example, involve the participation in joint workshops, the exchange of knowledge, the development and adoption of best practices, or joint communication activities. This could also involve networking and joint activities with projects funded under other clusters and pillars of Horizon Europe, or other EU programmes, as appropriate.

This topic aims at supporting activities that are enabling or contributing to one or several expected impacts of destination 3 “Tackling diseases and reducing disease burden”. To that end, proposals under this topic should aim for delivering results that are directed, tailored towards and contributing to all of the following expected outcomes:
Health care professionals employ safer and evidence-based clinical decision support systems for affordable treatment, including home-based care.
Health care professionals better predict patients’ (long-term) response, including adverse side effects of a specific personalised treatment.
Patients and carers have access to disease-specific communication packages informing about a disease and the proposed treatment.
Clinical guidelines are enhanced thanks to novel, clinically validated and (cost-) effective AI solutions.
Scope:
Applying trustworthy-AI[1] in healthcare contexts generate a multitude of benefits, including more effective disease management by optimised personalised treatments and assessment of health outcomes.
Based on existing (pre)clinical evidence, proposals should focus on implementing clinical studies to validate AI-based solutions comparing their benefits versus standard-of-care treatments in non-communicable diseases. Proposals should pay special attention to the usability, performance and safety of the AI-based solutions developed, and above all to their clinical evaluation and (cost-)effectiveness in view of their inclusion into current clinical guidelines for personalised treatments following current EU regulatory framework.
Proposals should address all of the following:
Supporting the clinical development, testing and validation of AI-assisted treatment and care options, hereby assisting in clinical decision-making;
Timely end-user inclusion (e.g. patient, caregiver and health care professional) along the clinical development of the AI-based solutions and the clinical validation process, considering the potential of social innovation approaches to support inclusion and dialogue between patients, carers and health care professionals;
Enhancing accurate prognosis for and response to a specific personalised treatment, hereby providing a solid risk assessment (e.g. potential adverse events, side effects, expected treatment compliance and adherence over the time compared to standard care);
Inclusion of sex and gender aspects, age, socio-economic, lifestyle and behavioural factors and other social determinants of health, as soon as possible considering also early stages/phases of development;
Assessing potential manual or automated biases for large uptake;
Integration of an extensive information and communication package about AI-assisted treatment options;, highlighting their relevance for the patients and carers;
Measuring the (cost-)effectiveness of AI-assisted development of therapeutic strategies and its implementation in clinical practice.
Proposals should describe a pathway for establishing standard operating procedures for the integration of AI in health care (e.g. for supporting clinical decision-making in treatment and care). Proposals are encouraged to consider multidisciplinary approaches and allow for intersectoral representation. Proposals have to ensure that resulting data comply with the FAIR[2] principles and data generated by the AI-based solutions are in line with established international standards.
Integration of ethics and health humanities perspectives are essential to ensure an ethical approach to the development of robust, fair and trustworthy AI solutions in health care, taking into account underrepresented patient populations. In relation to the use and interpretation of data, special attention should be paid to systematic discrimination or bias (e.g. due to gender or ethnicity) when developing and using AI solutions. Proposals should also focus on traceability, transparency, and auditability of AI algorithms in health. The international perspective should be taken into account, preferably through international collaboration, to ensure the comprehensiveness, interoperability and transferability of the developed solutions.
Where relevant, applicants are highly encouraged to deliver a plan for the regulatory acceptability of their technologies and to interact at an early stage with the relevant regulatory bodies. SME(s) participation is encouraged.

This topic aims at supporting activities that are enabling or contributing to one or several expected impacts of destination 3 “Tackling diseases and reducing disease burden”. To that end, proposals under this topic should aim for delivering results that are directed, tailored towards and contributing to all of the following expected outcomes:
Research funders, policy makers, relevant agencies and authorities, and the research community have a Strategic Research and Innovation Agenda (SRIA) to be implemented by the expected future European partnership on One Health antimicrobial resistance (OH AMR).
Research funders, policy makers, relevant agencies and authorities, and the research community profit from a strengthened coordination and collaboration among different fields of research and innovation with relevance to antimicrobial resistance (AMR) maintaining Europe's leading role in combating AMR.
Academics, innovators, end-users, researchers, public health authorities and citizens form a strong ecosystem that improves the implementation of the European One Health AMR strategy and its contribution to the Sustainable Development Goals.
Research funders, policy makers, relevant agencies and authorities, and the research community are in a position to close the current gaps and break existing silos on AMR in accordance with the European One Health Action Plan against AMR[1].
Scope:
The increasing levels of AMR present a major threat to human health with serious consequences also to animal and environmental health. Tackling AMR in bacteria, fungi, viruses and parasites requires a strong and coordinated response to protect citizens in Europe and beyond, as indicated in the European One Health Action Plan against AMR. This action plan provides the framework within which actions should be taken against this threat. It is recognised that combatting AMR requires a One Health approach, recognizing that human and animal health and the environment are interconnected. Many diseases affected by AMR are transmitted from animals to humans and vice versa, encompassing the environment as a link between humans and animals and as a reservoir of resistant microorganisms. Tackling AMR has also become a key priority as part of the Green Deal, including through the Farm to Fork Strategy[2]. Of importance are also the socio-economic drivers that affect the use of antimicrobials in human and animal healthcare veterinary medicine. However, the challenge in the current situation is that the AMR research and innovation landscape is still too fragmented addressing human health, animal health, feed, food safety and environment in silos, and it is also fragmented across Member States. Therefore, there is the need to move towards the integration of the various disciplines to overcome this fragmentation, thus tackling the problem of AMR with a comprehensive One Health approach bringing the diverse actors together.
Importantly, better co-ordination is essential to foster and accelerate the development and adoption of solutions to reverse the rising levels of AMR. This should allow generating the capacity and the ecosystem to improve the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of drug-resistant infections in humans.
Accordingly, proposals should cover all of the following activities:
Development of a Strategic Research and Innovation Agenda (SRIA) for a comprehensive approach to inform the expected future European partnership on One Health antimicrobial resistance (OH AMR).
Integration of key actors for AMR encompassing the field of human, veterinary and environmental disciplines and the broad spectrum of pathogens, including fungi and viruses.
Robust communication and effective information exchange between diverse scientific disciplines and among multiple sectors of the society that are implicated such as patients, clinicians, veterinarians, pharmacists, food producers, pharmaceutical industry, policy makers and researchers (including those working in the social sciences and humanities).
In order to achieve the expected outcomes, international cooperation, including with low- and middle-income countries where AMR is highly prevalent and prone to spread to Europe, is strongly encouraged. Proposals should build on, be complementary to and go beyond existing initiatives such as the JPIAMR[3][1], the One Health EJP[4] [2] and ICARS[5][3]. It should also implement collaborative activities with International organisations such as the World Health Organization, the World Animal Health Organisation (OIE), the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), and the G7 and G20 fora, with the aim to avoid duplication of efforts.
As regards integration and coordination activities, the proposal should be ambitious in its inclusiveness, encompassing the broad spectrum of pathogens, and mobilise experts from diverse disciplines, including from the social sciences and humanities, to address understanding, prevention, monitoring, epidemiology (e.g. emergence, spread, persistence), treatments and detection of AMR. It should also be a pan-European consortium with a large geographical coverage of European countries.
Proposals are expected to explore links with the following expected future European partnership of Horizon Europe: Pandemic preparedness; Innovative Health Initiative; EU-Africa Global Health; Personalised Medicine; Animals and Health; Safe and Sustainable Food Systems for People; Planet and Climate; Biodiversity, Towards more Sustainable Farming: Agro-ecology Living Labs and Research Infrastructures; Water4All – Water Security for the Planet.
The project selected for funding is expected to inform the expected future European partnership on OH AMR. To that end, the proposal selected for funding is also expected to interact with other relevant projects funded under other topics and other clusters to ensure synergies on cross-cutting challenges of common interest such as those from the health cluster’s destination 2 “Living and working in a health-promoting environment”.

This topic aims at supporting activities that are enabling or contributing to one or several expected impacts of destination 3 “Tackling diseases and reducing disease burden”. To that end, proposals under this topic should aim for delivering results that are directed, tailored towards and contributing to all of the following expected outcomes:
Reduced health-related suffering and improved well-being and quality of life for cancer patients in need of supportive, palliative, survivorship or end-of-life care as well as for their professional and family caregivers.
Cancer patients (independently of their age) have early and better access to supportive, palliative, survivorship or end-of-life care services of higher quality and (cost)effectiveness.
Reduced societal, healthcare and economic burden associated with increasing demands of supportive, palliative, survivorship or end-of-life care services that is beneficial for citizens and preserves the sustainability of the health care systems.
Health care providers and health policy makers have access to and use improved clinical guidelines and policies with respect to pain management, psychological and/or spiritual support, and supportive, palliative, survivorship or end-of-life care for cancer patients.
Cancer patients and their professional and family caregivers use the improved evidence-based and information-driven palliative care decision-making process.
Scope:
The complexity of health conditions related to cancer and late or long-term side effects as consequences of its treatments affect the quality of life of cancer patients and their families and pose a significant societal and economic burden. Palliative[1], supportive[2], survivorship and end-of-life care approaches improve the quality of life for cancer patients and professional and family caregivers through the prevention and relief of suffering by means of early identification, assessment and treatment of pain and other problems such as physical, psychosocial and spiritual problems. Although a variety of interventions are in use, they are often insufficiently validated or adapted to the specific needs of cancer patients and cancer survivors, often affected by co- or multi-morbidities. Thus, there is a need to strengthen the evidence base for patient-centred, effective interventions improving the quality of life and outcomes of cancer patients and cancer survivors of all ages in the domains of supportive, palliative, survivorship and end-of-life care.
Proposals should address all of the following activities:
Demonstrate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of newly proposed or specifically adapted pharmacological and/or non-pharmacological interventions to improve well-being and the quality of life of cancer patients. Serious late and long-term side effects of cancer treatments or symptoms that occur at the end of life of those patients as well as of cancer survivors should be considered. The legal and ethical aspects of the proposed interventions should be taken into consideration and be fully addressed.
Prove the feasibility of integrating the proposed interventions in current pain management, palliative, supportive, survivorship and/or end-of-life care regimes and healthcare systems across Europe. The complex human, social, cultural and ethical aspects that are necessarily managed by those care regimes and healthcare systems should be reflected from the patients’ perspectives as well as those of their professional and family caregivers. The views and values of patients and their caregivers (including families, volunteers, nurses and others) should also be appropriately taken into account in patient-centred care decisions.
Identify and analyse relationships between sex, gender, age, disabilities and socio-economic factors in health and any other relevant factors (e.g. ethical, familial, cultural considerations, including personal beliefs and religious perspectives, etc.) that could affect health equity[3] of the proposed interventions, including equitable access.
Analyse the barriers and opportunities to re-invigorating and enhancing timely social inclusion and active engagement of cancer patients in need of supportive, palliative, survivorship and end-of-life care and their caregivers.
Provide guidelines for patient-centred communication as well as standards for evidence-based communication trainings for caregivers, considering the potential of social innovation approaches or tools.
When relevant, provide policy recommendations for pain management, psychological and/or spiritual support, and supportive, palliative, survivorship or end-of-life care of cancer patients afflicted by late and long-term side effects of cancer treatments.
Randomised clinical trials and observational studies, targeting children or adults or elderly, should be considered for this topic. Proposals should give a sound feasibility assessment, provide details of the methodology, including an appropriate patient selection and realistic recruitment plans, justified by available publications and/or preliminary results.
This topic requires effective contributions from the social sciences and humanities (SSH) through the involvement of SSH experts and institutions as well as the inclusion of relevant SSH expertise, in order to produce meaningful and significant effects enhancing the societal impact of the related research activities. Proposals should consider a patient-centred approach that empowers patients, promotes a culture of dialogue and openness between health professionals, patients and their families, and unleashes the potential for social innovation.
All projects funded under this topic are strongly encouraged to participate in networking and joint activities, as appropriate. These networking and joint activities could, for example, involve the participation in joint workshops, the exchange of knowledge, the development and adoption of best practices, or joint communication activities. This could also involve networking and joint activities with projects funded under other clusters and pillars of Horizon Europe, or other EU programmes, as appropriate. Therefore, proposals are expected to include a budget for the attendance to regular joint meetings and may consider to cover the costs of any other potential joint activities without the prerequisite to detail concrete joint activities at this stage. The details of these joint activities will be defined during the grant agreement preparation phase. In this regard, the Commission may take on the role of facilitator for networking and exchanges, including with relevant stakeholders, if appropriate.

To that end, proposals under this topic should aim for delivering results that are directed, tailored towards and contributing to all of the following expected outcomes:
Health care providers and professionals in sub-Saharan Africa have a better understanding of poverty-related infectious diseases affecting these countries and use new evidences and advanced innovative health technologies or concepts to prevent, treat or diagnose poverty-related infectious diseases in sub-Saharan Africa.
Health authorities and health care systems have access to health data and evidences to better develop and implement informed health policies and improved clinical guidelines for health care in sub-Saharan Africa.
Health care systems, clinicians and researchers have access to improved clinical research capacities and strengthened infrastructures for clinical research, development and implementation in sub-Saharan Africa, enabling in particular an accelerated development of new, low-cost, easy-to-implement solutions for improved delivery of medical interventions for vulnerable populations in low-resource settings.
More researchers at the early stages of their career (e.g. Master’s, PhD or post-doctoral level) are able to develop their own scientific career in sub-Saharan Africa and/or establish themselves as scientific leaders in sub-Saharan Africa.
More clinicians and researchers in sub-Saharan Africa have the capacity to develop and design large-scale studies.
Scope:
The European and Developing Countries Clinical Trials Partnership (EDCTP) has established itself as the focal point of cooperation in clinical research on infectious disease between the EU and sub-Saharan Africa. To continue these investments after the last calls of the EDCTP2 programme, there is a need to further support research on the major infectious disease threats facing sub-Saharan Africa. Despite large-scale investments in product development for poverty-related infectious diseases (PRDs), progress in achieving public health gain is slow, while sub-Saharan Africa bears the highest burden of these diseases. There is a need to support product development and to encourage the use of new, innovative approaches and emerging technologies in sub-Saharan Africa to achieve rapid progress and impact. The COVID-19 pandemic is generating novel knowledge that could also advance prevention, treatment or diagnosis of PRDs in this part of the world.
Proposals should address all of the following:
Any PRD disease or group of PRDs affecting sub-Saharan Africa (within the scope of EDCTP2[1] or the proposed EDCTP3 and its draft strategic research and innovation agenda[2]).
Combine health technologies with other scientific areas such as mobile technologies and digital technologies (mHealth and eHealth), big data processing, and other emerging technologies.
Implement one or more medium-scale clinical trials and/or clinical research studies that can deliver the proof-of-concept or validate smart, highly innovative health technologies or concepts to prevent, treat or diagnose PRDs in sub-Saharan Africa, drawing lessons from the COVID-19 experience.
Increase collaboration with investors in development cooperation and international partnerships to create solutions for improved development or delivery of medical interventions for vulnerable populations in low-resource settings.
Proposals involving pharmaceutical companies and small- or medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are encouraged.
Develop solutions that are easily integrated or linked to existing electronic or digital systems that are used in the implementation of clinical research and health systems’ patient management.
Include activities that promote collaboration with ongoing and future EDCTP projects. In this context the granting authority may share project-relevant information with the EDCTP Association and the future EDCTP3 Joint Undertaking.
Promote the integration of research work and health care service delivery.

This topic aims at supporting activities that are enabling or contributing to one or several expected impacts of destination 6 “Maintaining an innovative, sustainable and globally competitive health industry”. To that end, proposals under this topic should aim for delivering results that are directed, tailored towards and contributing to all of the following expected outcomes:
Health authorities and healthcare providers have identified the needs and potential procurers;
Potential procurers are ready to establishing an innovation partnership for the development and the procurement of new antimicrobials;
Potential procurers are able to engage and commit financially in view of the establishment of an innovation partnership.
Scope:
The aim of this topic is to prepare for the establishment of a pull incentive for new antimicrobials where there is an unmet public health need and a market failure. In line with the Pharmaceutical Strategy for Europe that was published in November 2020[1] innovative approaches at EU level should be developed for supporting research, development and public procurement of antimicrobials to address the issue of antimicrobial resistance. These approaches could make use of European legislation, such as the possibility of an innovation partnership[2] that would allow for the combination of development of new antimicrobials and procurement elements and should be tailored to public health needs.
To that end, a preparatory phase is necessary. Proposers are expected to create the conditions for the establishment of a future innovation partnership. They should take advantage of the latest developments such as experiences gained within Europe on the advance purchase agreements for COVID-19 vaccines. With the help of experts, potential procurers of new antimicrobials in the Member States have to set out the requirements and conditions for the final product(s) to be developed and purchased. This will needs to be guided by public health needs and should be based on priority pathogens such as those identified by WHO[3]. These requirements and conditions needed to guide development will have to be developed with input of scientific experts and in close collaboration with Commission services, and need to be agreed upon with a view of EU Member States’ and Associated States commitments to purchase the new antimicrobials. Proposers should also develop a broad communication strategy towards stakeholders and other potential procurers.
Proposals are expected to address all of the following:
Emerging health threats, particularly those resulting from antimicrobial resistance (AMR), and identification of relevant public health needs in the development of new antibiotics.
Design of a feasible option for a pull incentive that combines EU support for late stage development of antimicrobials with procurement by Member States and Associated Countries (implementation of the pull incentive will be beyond the scope of this CSA).
Readiness and interest of potential developers/suppliers of antimicrobials
Market failures and the challenges of availability and accessibility of therapeutics.
Conditions for development and purchase of new antimicrobials.
Requirements for financing.

This topic aims at supporting activities that are enabling or contributing to one or several impacts of destination 1 “Staying healthy in a rapidly changing society”. To that end, proposals under this topic should aim for delivering results that are directed, tailored towards and contributing to all of the following expected outcomes:
European citizens are educated, motivated and empowered to use digital tools for monitoring and managing their own physical, mental and social health and well-being. As a result, they take on a more active role in achieving their health potential and in adopting healthy lifestyles at home, in the community and at work, and they also interact better with their doctors and carers (receiving and providing feedback). Citizens are more health literate, are more autonomous and active, participate more in social life, have better employment opportunities, take on a more active role in achieving their health potential and in turn have a higher quality of life.
Member States actively contribute to health literacy efforts, monitor and evaluate them.
Health care and social services are better integrated, affordable, open to diversity and inclusion: they comply with precautionary protections concerning sensitive health data, consider the needs of end users (citizens, formal and informal carers) and innovation carriers (SMEs, hospitals) and favour tools of social innovation.
Health promotion and disease prevention are enhanced by the awareness of healthier lifestyle behaviours, and overall there are better health outcomes throughout the life-course. There is a greater involvement of non-health sectors (including environment, food, safety and occupational health) and this has a direct impact on the determinants of health. Overall, there is a boost in the transition from treatment to prevention and this contributes to the reengineering of prevention into health care.
Scope:
Digital technologies are a driving force for empowering citizens in taking on an active role in the management of their own health and well-being as well as for supporting innovations for coordinated person-centred care models.
There is a growing body of evidence demonstrating the value of digital health interventions and solutions for health promotion, disease prevention and treatment. However, in parallel, it is vital to ensure that online-based patient-centred programmes do not leave behind the very people they are primarily designed to empower. Moreover, citizen’s digital health literacy is essential for the successful transformation of health care systems.
Accordingly, the proposed activities should address all of the following:
Map health literacy research in the EU (and beyond).
Develop a comprehensive and inclusive European strategy in improving (digital) health literacy for the benefit of all citizens focusing on health promotion, disease prevention, treatment and (self-)care as well as on monitoring its impact on the quality of life, wellbeing, productivity and the economy, taking into account geographic, social and economic determinants of inequities in digital health literacy.
Help patients navigate the health care systems, interact with their doctors and carers as well as better manage their own health at home, in the community and at work.
Create a network of champions in digital health literacy across the EU (and beyond) to foster exchange and uptake of best practices.
Set concrete targets as well as areas for improvement on health literacy levels across Europe.
Develop monitoring mechanisms and indicators to assess health literacy levels and their evolution across Member States.
Include stakeholders from all relevant sectors (including but not limited to education, innovation, health care, Medtech, media) and involve also citizens in the co-creation, design, planning, implementation and evaluation of the strategy, including through social innovation tools and approaches.
In all instances, gender as well as demographic, geographic and socio-economic aspects should be duly taken into account.

Researchers, innovators and pharmaceutical industries develop and produce greener pharmaceuticals that are either greener by design, intrinsically less harmful for the environment, and/or use greener and economically more sustainable manufacturing processes for the production of pharmaceuticals.
Scope:
The EU needs to address the increasing problem of environmental pollution due to pharmaceuticals throughout their life cycle. This encompass both, the industry need to tackle the pollution due to their manufacturing as well as pollution resulting from the use and disposal of their pharmaceuticals. This topic is part of an EU strategic approach to pharmaceuticals in the environment[1] and the Pharmaceutical strategy for Europe[2] called for diversifying and secure supply chains and environmentally sustainable pharmaceuticals[3]. The purpose of this topic is twofold.
One of the purposes is to encourage taking into account the environmental aspects of pharmaceuticals as regards their use and disposal. The action intends to promote the development of pharmaceuticals intrinsically less harmful to environment. As regards the pharmaceuticals already in use, more understanding is needed concerning their environmental concentration and resulting levels of risk. In particular, the solid knowledge of the impact of molecules on the environment through the eco-toxicity studies will contribute to management of environmental risk and may be taken into account for designing of new molecules.
The second purpose is to promote the green innovation in the pharmaceutical manufacturing of marketed medicinal products, in particular manufacturing of their active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs). It will contribute to ensuring supplies of medicinal products and prevent shortages as well as crisis preparedness. The difficulties in ensuring compliance with the high environmental standards in the EU and high costs of such compliance are considered one of the main reason for pharmaceutical manufacturing leaving the EU. This in turn results in vulnerabilities of the supply chains (reduced number of suppliers of critical inputs, lack of geographical diversification of the suppliers, lack of critical manufacturing capacity in the EU). The new, greener and sustainable manufacturing methods, which would for the reason of lowering the environmental impact rely on recycled solvents, would need at the same time to address the risk of impurities.
Applicants should propose activities linked to several of the following elements:
Research and innovation to support the development of “greener” pharmaceuticals that degrade more readily to harmless substances in waste water treatment plants and the environment;
Research on the eco-toxicity and environmental fate of pharmaceuticals, in particular those that are not yet subject to environmental risk assessment;
Propose innovative manufacturing technology that are greener, low in energy consumption and emissions, using less solvent or recycling solvents;
Propose methods for eliminating carcinogenic impurities in pharmaceuticals (e.g. nitrosamines) process and medicinal products, in particular as complementary technologies to the manufacturing methods relying on recycled solvents;
Explore innovative uses of digital transformation or robotic for competitive and scalable methods of production.
The projects should favour a multi-stakeholders approach. They should address the industry needs, taking account of SMEs’ specificities, and offer deployable technical solutions and/or relevant data. They should also integrate at the same time the academic and public health perspective.
Proposals could consider the involvement of the European Commission's Joint Research Centre (JRC) in the field of new approach methodologies for ecotoxicity assessment.

This topic aims at supporting activities that are enabling or contributing to one or several impacts of destination 1 “Staying healthy in a rapidly changing society”. To that end, proposals under this topic should aim for delivering results that are directed, tailored towards and contributing to one or several of the following expected outcomes:
Researchers, health care professionals and developers of medical interventions have a much better understanding of how genetic, epigenetic and environmental risk and resilience factors interact to drive or prevent the transition from mental health to mental illness throughout the life course. Developers of medical interventions make use of this understanding to develop novel classes of medications and non-pharmaceutical interventions for the prevention and treatment of mental illnesses (including relapse prevention).
Mental health professionals have access to different types of validated biomarkers for making more accurate diagnoses (beyond current symptom-based criteria) and for optimising and personalising preventive and therapeutic treatment decisions. As a result, patients receive more targeted therapies and relapse less frequently. They experience less stigma due to more accurate and objective diagnoses and increased public awareness about the molecular and neurobiological basis of mental health and mental illness.
Citizens have the possibility to undergo laboratory testing for assessing their mental health and their predisposition to mental illnesses, and are given timely evidence-based guidance on personalised preventive measures that underpin their active engagement and adherence to effective strategies for promoting their mental health.
Public health authorities and policy makers have access to comprehensive clinical trial data on the effectiveness of different types of pharmacological and non-pharmacological strategies for the promotion of mental health and prevention of mental illnesses, helping them draft evidence-based clinical guidelines and best practices as well as design tailor-made prevention policies and campaigns.
Scope:
Mental illnesses represent a huge and growing burden for Europe, both at individual and societal level. There is an enormous stigma and they often remain undetected as diagnoses largely depend on symptom-based criteria without any biological markers linked to causative mechanisms. Currently available medications are primarily used by trial and error (rather than in a targeted and personalised manner) and they are all very similar in their mechanisms of action with rather little breakthrough innovation in the last few decades. There is further a lack of evidence base on the optimal use of different pharmacological and non-pharmacological prevention strategies. A deeper molecular and neurobiological understanding of the interplay between genetic, epigenetic and environmental risk and resilience factors, including neural circuit alterations, is critical for the development of objective biomarkers and evidence-based interventions that will significantly improve mental health outcomes.
Accordingly, the proposed research is expected to deliver on several of the following:
Significantly advance the molecular and neurobiological understanding of how genetic, epigenetic and environmental risk and resilience factors (such as psychosocial experiences, diet, sleep, natural and artificial light, use or abuse of drugs, infections and other exposures) interact to drive or prevent the transition from mental health to mental illness[1] throughout the life course as well as how such molecular and neurobiological changes could be reversed. The use of computational modelling and/or artificial intelligence tools is encouraged for the analysis of big, complex and heterogeneous data[2].
Develop relevant predictive models through federated analysis of large European cohorts of psychiatric disorders and investigate the biological and neural basis of pathogenetic mechanisms and symptoms shared by different disorders. If relevant to the disorders studied, develop neurobiologically-grounded models of cognition and social behaviour and apply these models and their simulation potential to the understanding and improved management of mental health conditions associated with behavioural or emotional dysfunction.
Identify, validate and document different types or combinations of biomarkers for all of the following purposes:
development of robust quantitative, clinical measures of mental health;
identification of signatures, for example genetic and epigenetic blueprints, conferring susceptibility to and protection against mental illnesses;
establishment of more objective diagnostic and monitoring criteria (complementing current symptom-based criteria) to improve patient outcomes and reduce the stigma associated with mental illness;
prediction of treatment response and risk of relapse for better, more scientifically-guided and targeted use of currently available preventive and therapeutic interventions for different population groups.
For biomarker discovery, applicants are encouraged to take stock of advances in disciplines such as for instance neuropsychology, neurophysiology, neuroendocrinology, neuroimaging, electrophysiological monitoring, e-health/m-health, -omics (genomics, epigenomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, lipidomics, exposomics, microbiomics including the role of the microbiota-gut-brain axis), optogenetics, nanomedicine, stem cell biology, neuroimmunology and immunopsychiatry.
Discover new disease pathways and drug targets (including pathways involved in maintaining mental health) to boost the development of new (or repurposed) classes of safer and more effective medications[3] for the prevention and treatment of mental illnesses (including relapse prevention).
Establish the molecular and neurobiological effects as well as cognitive and psychological consequences of both pharmacological and non-pharmacological prevention strategies (for example: neurostimulation, neurofeedback, psychotherapy and other psychological/behavioural interventions, light therapy, diet, exercise, lifestyle, mindfulness or a combination of them) and assess their efficacy and side effects as part of clinical trials (also determining windows of opportunity when preventive actions are most effective throughout the life course).
Proposals may cover different stages in the continuum of the innovation cycle (from basic and translational research to the validation of findings in real-world settings) and should ensure strong involvement of end-users, including citizens and patients. Sex and gender differences and the effects of age should be duly taken into account. International cooperation is encouraged and the proposed research is expected to be multidisciplinary, including through the involvement of medical sciences, psychological sciences, social sciences and the humanities.
All projects funded under this topic are strongly encouraged to participate in networking and joint activities, as appropriate. These networking and joint activities could, for example, involve the participation in joint workshops, the exchange of knowledge, the development and adoption of best practices, or joint communication activities. This could also involve networking and joint activities with projects funded under other clusters and pillars of Horizon Europe, or other EU programmes, as appropriate. Therefore, proposals are expected to include a budget for the attendance to regular joint meetings and may consider to cover the costs of any other potential joint activities without the prerequisite to detail concrete joint activities at this stage. The details of these joint activities will be defined during the grant agreement preparation phase. In this regard, the Commission may take on the role of facilitator for networking and exchanges, including with relevant stakeholders, if appropriate.

This topic aims at supporting activities that are enabling or contributing to one or several expected impacts of destination 6 “Maintaining an innovative, sustainable and globally competitive health industry”. To that end, proposals under this topic should aim for delivering results that are directed, tailored towards and contributing to all of the following expected outcomes:
European suppliers of health technology and services benefit from enhanced single market conditions for mHealth that facilitate economies of scale.
Health care systems and authorities are able to integrate mHealth solutions more rapidly thanks to a European ‘mHealth label’.
Citizens, patients and health care professionals make more use of trusted mHealth solutions for promoting their health and self-managing their health care needs.
European mHealth stakeholders build upon a digital ecosystem around a trusted mHealth label, an EU-wide promotion and uptake of technical specifications for health and wellness apps.
Health systems and citizens benefit from the supply and use of health innovations facilitated by the promotion of common pan-European principles for validation and certification.
Scope:
Europe is experiencing a fast growing market for health and wellness apps. At the same time, concerns about the quality and reliability of apps have risen (for example, many health and wellness apps are being published on app stores without clinical evidence supporting the claimed benefits that they will deliver)[1]. CEN[2], together with CEN/TC 251, ISO and IEC, developed a new technical specification for ‘Quality and Reliability of Health and Wellness Apps’ together with a CEN/ISO 82304-2 health app quality label (capturing medical safety, usability, safety of personal data and technical quality of health apps).
The objective of the technical specification is to define quality and reliability criteria, which support app developers to design and users of apps to select better apps.
The specification is intended for use by manufacturers of health apps as well as by app checkers in order to communicate the quality and reliability of a health app.
Applicants should propose activities that bring together app developers, health care system representatives, a diverse range of users (citizens/patients, health care providers), and certification bodies in order to promote and stimulate the use and up-take of the health app quality label, building a digital ecosystem around a trusted mHealth label to support the integration and use of health and wellness apps in the health care system. Proposals should encourage a people-centred approach that empowers citizens and patients, promotes a culture of dialogue and openness between health professionals, citizens, patients and their families, and unleashes the potential of social innovation.
The proposals are expected to address all of the following:
Set up a structured dialogue on the uptake of the technical specifications between app developers, health care system representatives, app stores, medical societies, patient organisations, users (including health care professionals) and certification bodies, building a digital ecosystem around a trustable mHealth label.
Co-create, develop and implement an action plan on the promotion of the mHealth label in the health care system.
Implement concrete actions on the integration and use of secure and qualitative health and wellness apps, using the new label, in specific health care settings, covering the entire EU.
Ensure that the promoted health and wellness apps are bias-free and adequately address the needs of different social groups, considering gender, age, ability and ethnicity, where relevant.
Support and set-up an inclusive dissemination strategy to promote the use of the mHealth app quality label (cfr. EU energy labels and EU Nutri-Score nutrition label) taking into account the different levels of digital health literacy among the actors involved.
Interests of different age groups, sex and gender, as well as other categories like persons with disability, ethnicity and the LGBTI+ community should be considered, where relevant.

Projects are expected to contribute to the following expected outcomes:
Significant number of experimental citizen science initiatives kick-started;
Significant number of citizen science initiatives supported to become sustainable;
Significant number of newcomers to the Framework Programme and a significant number of citizens involved in co-producing scientific knowledge;
Increased recognition of excellent citizen science initiatives throughout the European Research Area;
Improved evidence base for making policy on citizen science.
These targeted outcomes in turn contribute to medium and long-term impacts:
Increased engagement of citizens with science and researchers with citizens;
Increased public trust in science;
Increased alignment of strategic research with society needs, expectations and values;
Better understanding among citizens of the process of building scientific knowledge through experimentation;
Increased capacity in the EU R&I system to conduct open science and to set it as a modus operandi of modern science;
A more open and inclusive research and innovation system.
Scope:
Citizen Science is a rapidly emerging mode of research and innovation that shows huge promise in terms of collecting new qualities and quantities of data, harnessing collective intelligence, improving science-society literacy, and improving the relationship between science and society. However, financial support is not well adapted to the needs of small-scale and experimental activities and many citizen science initiatives that have proven their worth fail to sustain over the longer term. In addition, citizen science is under-recognised for its role in bridging between science and society, under-utilised where it is needed such as in relation to the Green Deal and the Sustainable Development Goals, and practitioners of citizen science are insufficiently recognised within the EU research and innovation system as conducting high-quality activities that can have numerous side-benefits.
In order to help remedy these weaknesses in the European research and innovation system, this action will launch two calls for proposals through financial support to third parties:
Kick-starting: This will kick-start and provide support services to at least 100 citizen science activities that are at the conceptual or pilot stage and which show promise in terms of innovative theme or approach, collecting and analysing data, or generating other important benefits.
Sustaining: This will support at least 25 on-going or recent citizen science activities to find ways to sustain their activities; these will have shown their worth in terms of innovative theme or approach, collecting and analysing data, generating other important benefits, or have particular potential to scale up across member states or the ERA.
The two calls may be launched over one or more waves but it should not be necessary to be supported by the ‘kick-starting’ call to apply for ‘sustainable’ call. Efforts should be made to evaluate the response to the open calls, capture the benefits arising from the citizen science activities it kick-starts (social, economic, democratic, scientific, etc.), and develop intelligence about factors that support or hinder the sustainability of successful citizen science initiatives.
In addition, this action should launch a European Union Prize for Citizen Science (funded by the action through financial support to third parties) open to all citizen science initiatives involving research and innovation actors, including civil society organisations, in the European Union. The action should prepare, publicise and launch the competition, organise a high-profile award ceremony and showcase the breadth and scope of excellent citizen science activities taking place across the European Union. In close liaison with the Commission throughout the process, the action should decide on the award categories, setup the panel of experts that will evaluate the contestants, and develop the conditions for participation and the award criteria that enable identification of excellent/best-in-class examples of citizen science in terms of their contribution to the scientific evidence base and/or other benefits (e.g. societal, economic, democratic). The action should also set up a comprehensive communication strategy around the prize. Prizes should be awarded to several winners (e.g. for different categories) and be funded through financial support to third parties. Each prize should be in the range of EUR 10 000 – 60 000.
Across all three of parts (kick-starting, sustaining, and the citizen science prize), the action should consider citizen science across all areas of research and innovation and take into account all of the different forms of participation that citizen science can entail without prejudice to any. Significant efforts should be made to be inclusive in terms of geography, gender, ethnicity, disability, age, socio-economic background etc. The large majority of the funding should be allocated to the activities to kick-start and sustain citizen science initiatives. The action should develop policy recommendations, policy briefs, and other research and innovation results/outputs and disseminate its experiences and learnings widely.
The action should build on and valorise the results of earlier projects in the Science and Society (FP6), Science in Society (FP7) and Science with and for Society (Horizon 2020) programmes, in particular projects focused on public engagement, responsible research and innovation, and citizen science, as well as of national and regional initiatives, and should aim to provide a seamless transition between previous supporting actions and this new action.
The project should last a minimum of 4 years.

Advancement of knowledge, policy and practice on inclusive gender equality in research and innovation institutions across Europe, with an intersectional, geographically inclusive, and multi-sectorial approach.
Reduced disparities across Member States and strengthening of the European Research Area and its gender equality and inclusiveness objective.
Scope:
As having a Gender Equality Plan (GEP) in place is becoming an eligibility criterion for legal entities applying to Horizon Europe, and, as the new European Research Area Communication of 30 September 2020 is foreseeing stronger measures to promote inclusive gender equality plans, there is a strong need for expert policy and knowledge support for inclusive GEP implementation, in research and innovation (R&I) organisations (including research funding and performing organisations, incl. companies and SMEs) across EU Member States. In order to adapt to different national and local situations, and help foster effective transformation in countries and institutions less advanced in the field of gender equality in R&I, a first European centre of excellence on inclusive gender equality in R&I will be created.
Building on projects and actions supported through Horizon 2020, including projects ACT, GE Academy, GENDERACTION, and the pilot European knowledge and support facility for fostering institutional change through gender equality plans funded under the SwafS work programme 2020, as well as on initiatives developed by existing national or regional centres of excellence and knowledge centres on gender equality in R&I in Europe, and by European R&I stakeholder umbrella organisations, proposals are expected to cover the following:
Establish a sustainable European Centre of Excellence and think tank to advance and disseminate knowledge on inclusive gender equality policies in R&I, addressing three levels of inclusiveness, i.e.: the intersectional level, considering intersecting social categories such as ethnicity (including migration and refugees), disability, sexual orientation and gender identity (LGBTIQ issues) or else social origin; the sectorial level, to better address innovation and the private sector; and geographical inclusiveness. This Centre could work as a single entity or as core centre and network of hubs in different Member States, and should involve experts from different Member States, including widening countries.
Provide expertise and support to Member States, R&I organisations, and the European Commission, in the design, implementation and assessment of institutional change through inclusive gender equality plans, including through the design and delivery of tailored training activities on inclusive gender equality in R&I, and the development of an enhanced Community of Practice on gender equality and diversity in R&I organisations, including R&I performing and funding organisations.
Provide expert support for the collection of pan-European data on gender equality in R&I and the development of new indicators, including on intersectionality. Collected data should cover also information on the uptake and implementation of gender equality plans in EU Member States and Associated countries, and contribute to the She Figures[1] publication.

Projects are expected to contribute to the following expected outcomes:
Development of a consistent and sustainable coordination network of national representatives on gender equality and inclusiveness in support of the implementation of the ERA Communication policy objectives, leading to better coordination of Member States' efforts.
Scope:
The new European Research Area (Communication of 30 September 2020 on “A new ERA for Research and Innovation”) is foreseeing strong measures to promote inclusive gender equality plans in Research and Innovation (R&I) organisations, in line with the European Strategy for Gender Equality for the period 2020-2025, to which R&I, and Horizon Europe, must contribute actively. As the new ERA Communication and the Council Conclusions of 1 December 2020 on the new ERA underline, there is a need for policy coordination to advance the implementation of the ERA gender equality and inclusiveness objectives within the Member States. Ensuring the active promotion of equal opportunities for all includes opening up gender equality policies in R&I to diversity, and more specifically to: social categories and grounds for discrimination intersecting with gender, such as ethnicity, disability, sexual orientation or else socio-economic status; geographical inclusiveness; and opening to the innovation and private sector. This new inclusive approach to gender equality is also embedded in the new European Commission Gender Equality Strategy 2020-2025.
Building on related projects and actions supported through Horizon 2020, including project GENDERACTION, the action focuses on the establishment of a sustainable network of national representatives from all EU Member States and Associated Countries, both from national bodies (e.g. ministries) and from national research funding organisations, to support the implementation of the gender equality and inclusiveness objectives of the ERA. During its lifetime, the action should:
Develop various innovative and engagement activities, connect citizens, experts and policy makers, as well as contribute to policy making at national and European administration level.
Provide support and advancing the knowledge of representatives of widening countries is of particular importance. The action should also develop knowledge and build capacities, competences and expertise for gender equality and mainstreaming in R&I with a variety of European and national stakeholders. Special consideration will be given to mutual learning exercises to enhance the competence of national gender equality representatives, including helping less experienced national gender representatives to acquire expertise.
Establish a transnational Community of Practice of R&I funding organisations for the promotion of a gender-inclusive culture change in R&I institutions across Europe, linked through a Memorandum of Understanding. Specific attention should be paid to promoting the development of incentives or setting requirements at research funding level to foster institutional change in organisations, as well as establishing a zero-tolerance policy on gender-based violence including sexual harassment in R&I organisations.
A specific focus should also be placed on promoting the integration of the gender dimension into R&I content, with an opening to intersectionality. For this, the action should foresee mobilising national expertise on the integration of the sex and gender analysis in R&I content to support the different Horizon Europe National Contact Points in all EU Member States.
The work by this action should be performed in coordination with ERA-related official groups, and in collaboration with the European Commission, in line with ERA objectives.
The participation of at least 23 Member States, and in addition, of national representatives from Associated Countries, to the consortium, is strongly encouraged, and the project must engage and deploy activities with all EU Member States and, as much as possible, with all Associated Countries.

Projects are expected to contribute to the following expected outcomes:
The actions funded under this topic will coordinate national and regional R&I programmes by pooling national resources and contributing to the alignment of national research and innovation policies. The expected outcomes:
Identification of common research and innovation priorities agreed among the participating national and regional R&I programmes, taking into account international developments where relevant;
Implementation of multiannual joint calls, resulting in the funding of transnational collaborative R&I projects;
Implementation of other joint activities supporting the market, regulatory or societal uptake of results;
Contribution to participating states meeting Global Challenges, including relevant contribution to the SDGs.
Scope:
Since the introduction of the European Research Area (ERA) and starting of FP6, Programme level collaboration among Member States and their research and innovation programmes has become a cornerstone of the ERA, with annual investment from Member States of more than EUR 800 million per year. More than 250 networks among research funders have been created over time, serving different research needs but always coordinating public research investments across borders and allowing researchers to apply for calls for transnational research projects funded by the participating states.
The new policy approach to European Partnerships limits co-funding to Member State collaboration to Union and Horizon Europe priorities. Therefore, the ERA part of the Horizon Europe provides the possibility for Member States, Associated Countries and civil society organisations such as foundations, to maintain existing and establish new collaborations on priorities of their choice.
The successful proposal should align national and regional research funding programmes (managed by national or regional programme owners / managers) on agreed common priorities and implement joint calls for transnational R&I projects as well as other joint calls. Applicants have to demonstrate clear commitments from participating programmes to pool resources and ensure complementarity between activities and policies with those of the Framework Programme and relevant European Partnership Initiatives.
Proposals should pool the necessary resources from the participating national (or regional) research programmes as well as, where appropriate, leverage resources from pertinent foundations, charities and transnational initiatives, with a view to implementing calls for proposals resulting in grants to third parties without EU co-funding in this area.
The proposal should also demonstrate potential impact at national, regional and transnational level research and innovation. The proposal should demonstrate that activities exclude overlaps with on-going actions co-funded by the EU under Horizon 2020 or Horizon Europe.
Participation of legal entities from third countries and/or regions including those not automatically eligible for funding is encouraged.
The actions should envisage a duration which is appropriate to the ambition and complexity of the proposed topic.

","single-stage
Deadline date","ExpectedOutcome:
Projects are expected to contribute to the following expected outcomes:
Recommendations for policy makers, research funding and performing organisations, higher education institutions and other research and innovation actors for tackling societal mistrust in science, research and innovation;
Recommendations for strengthening the co-creation of R&I contents by society, and for the spreading of good practices and evidence of their effects.
These targeted outcomes in turn contribute to medium and long-term impacts:
Increased public trust in science;
Increased alignment of strategic research with society needs, expectations and values.
Scope:
Societal trust in the research system and confidence in its outcomes is vital to ensure the EU’s contribution to attain the Sustainable Development Goals and to achieve the European Green Deal targets; for the uptake of innovation in society; and for continued public support for investment in R&I.
Trust depends on scientists and engineers’ capacity to demonstrate high standards of research integrity, an ethical mind-set, critical thinking and rigorous exploration of ideas in an open, transparent manner; and their desire to maximise the societal relevance, robustness and overall quality of outcomes. This, in turn, is fostered by conducive institutional governance arrangements and policy environments. In addition, citizen and civil society’s involvement in co-creating R&I agendas and contents makes research more relevant and responsive to society and strengthens co-ownership and trust in scientific evidence and innovation.
However, not all research is conducted in line with these high standards. Rules and guidelines are sometimes missing or ignored, research protocols and raw data are not always published, methodological limitations may be inadequately addressed, inappropriate statistical analyses may lead to exaggeration of conclusions, papers are generally only published when significant results are obtained, and self-interest may interfere in peer-review processes. A significant part of research cannot be reproduced and therefore cannot be relied upon to build a solid base for policy or innovation, and this leads in turn to a decrease in societal trust in research and innovation. Compounding this, research often addresses issues of limited direct relevance to end-users, or comes to conclusions that are wildly out of step with societal needs and values, including gender equality related ones, because societal input to setting the research agenda and taking part in research is often treated as an afterthought – long after innovations and research trajectories have been decided.
To better understand the nature and scale of the sources and consequences of mistrust of society in science and the challenges of science-society co-creation, a series of expert workshops, small-scale studies and participatory research actions should take into account existing knowledge (including from projects funded under previous Framework Programmes) and should lead to new and robust evidence and analysis, as a basis for further policy action. Evidence from relevant Eurobarometers, and national science barometers, should form particularly important inputs to this action.
The action should involve a broad range of potential users and stakeholders and the general public in co-creation (e.g. civil society, businesses, research/academia, public authorities and policy makers), develop policy guidance and recommendations, and implement innovative means of communicating and disseminating the findings and messages. As such, Responsible Research and Innovation could be a relevant research approach. Close co-operation should be sought with relevant projects to encourage uptake and early sharing of knowledge and evidence.

","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
While robots originated in large-scale mass manufacturing, they are now spreading to more and more application areas. In these new settings, robots are often faced with new technical and non-technical challenges. The purpose of this topic is to address such issues in a modular and open way, and reduce the barriers that prevent a more widespread adoption of robots. Four Priority Areas (PAs) are targeted: healthcare, inspection and maintenance of infrastructure, agri-food, and agile production.
User needs, ethical, legal, societal and economic aspects should be addressed in order to raise awareness and take-up by citizens and businesses. Privacy and cybersecurity issues, including security by design and data integrity should also be addressed, where appropriate.
Scope:
a) Research and Innovation boosting promising robotics applications
Innovative approaches to hard research problems in relation to applications of robotics in promising new areas are particularly encouraged. Proposals are expected to enable substantially improved solutions to challenging technical issues, with a view of take-up in applications with high socio-economic impact. Driven by application needs, the work can start from research at low TRL, but proposals are expected to validate their results in realistic environments in order to demonstrate the potential for take-up in the selected application(s).
The call is open to all robotics-related research topics and to all new application areas. Excluded are the four priority areas which are already covered elsewhere in this work programme: healthcare, inspection and maintenance of infrastructure, agri-food and agile production. Proposals will be expected to plan efforts to connect and cooperate with the DIHs, Platforms and other relevant activities of this work programme, as appropriate.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU between €3 million and €5 million would allow this area to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
b) Innovation Actions - Robotics for infrastructure inspection and maintenance
Establish large-scale pilots capable of demonstrating the use of robotics at scale in actual or highly realistic operating environments; showcase advanced prototype applications built around platforms operating in real or near-real environments and demonstrate high levels of socio-economic impact.
Through large-scale pilots, proposals are expected to make a significant step forward in platform development in the area of infrastructure inspection and maintenance. Starting from suitable reference architectures, platform interfaces are defined, tested via piloting, and supported via ecosystem building preparing their roll-out, and are being evolved over time into standards.
Each proposal is expected to establish large scale pilots. They are expected to: consider utilising existing infrastructure and links to other European, national or private funding-sources; identify the long-term sustainability of the pilot; develop scalable technical solutions capable of meeting performance targets; develop metrics and performance measures for the pilot; engage relevant industry stakeholders, including SMEs, in the provision and operation of the pilot. Proposals will be expected to dedicate resources to disseminate best practice and coordinate access to platforms and demonstrators, in particular in connecting with the Robotics DIHs and Core Technologies actions and other relevant activities, in H2020 and beyond.
Pilots are expected to address both technical and non-technical issues, such as socio-economic impact, novel business models, legal and regulatory, ethical and cyber-security issues and connections to Big Data and IoT.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU between €7 million and €9 million would allow this area to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
c) Robotics Competitions
Competitions aims at reducing technical and commercial risks by allowing commercial and technical performance data to be gathered and assessed. They provide a real or near-real operating environment for long-term trials and the testing of deployment strategies.
Proposals (CSA) should address the delivery of challenge-led, robotics competitions focusing on the four application areas prioritised: Healthcare, Infrastructure Inspection and Maintenance, Agri-Food, and Agile Production. Besides the technological objectives, proposals are also expected to stimulate public engagement and engage with the Robotics DIHs. Proposals should address all aspects of running competitions as public events, and engage with the media and public. Proposals should seek to mobilise external partners in sponsoring and setting up the competitions.
Expected Impact:
a)
Strengthening European excellence in Robotics S&T
Boosting the use of robotics in promising application areas
Opening up new markets for robotics
Lowering barriers in the deployment of robotics-based solutions.
b)
Demonstration of the potential for robotics to impact at scale in the chosen application areas prioritised in this call (infrastructure inspection and maintenance).
Reduction of technical and commercial risk in the deployment of services based on robotic actors within the selected application area.
Greater understanding from the application stakeholders of the potential for deploying robotics.
Demonstration of platforms operating over extended time periods in near realistic environments and promotion of their use.
Develop the eco-system around the prioritised application areas to stimulate deployment.
Contribution to the development of open, industry-led or de facto standards
c)
Greater public exposure to actual robotics capability.
Greater engagement with competitions from commercial organisations in the four prioritised application areas: Healthcare, Infrastructure Inspection and Maintenance, Agri-Food and Agile Production.

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
The lack of trusted and secure platforms and privacy-aware analytics methods for secure sharing of personal data and proprietary/commercial/industrial data hampers the creation of a data market and data economy by limiting data sharing mostly to open data. This need strongly emerges from recent evidence from stakeholders, both for personal data platforms[1] and for industrial data platforms.[2],[3],[4] The lack of ICT and Data skills seriously limits the capacity of Europe to respond to the digitisation challenge of industry. Specific attention needs to be put in involving SMEs and give them access to data and technology. IT standardisation faces new challenges as technologies converge and federated systems arise, creating new gaps in interoperability.
All grants under this topic will be subject to Article 30.3 of the grant agreement (Commission right to object to transfers or licensing).
Scope:
a) Innovation Actions for setting up and operating platforms for secure and controlled sharing of ""closed data"" (proprietary and/or personal data). The actions should address the necessary technical, organisational, legal and commercial aspects of data sharing/brokerage/trading, and build on existing computing platforms. Proposals shall address one or both of the following sub-topics:
Personal data platforms shall ensure respect of prevailing legislation and allow data subjects and data owners to remain in control of their data and its subsequent use. Solutions should preserve utility for data analysis and allow for the management of privacy / utility trade-offs, metadata privacy, including query privacy. Solutions should also develop privacy metrics that are easy to understand for data subjects and contribute to the economic value of data by allowing privacy-preserving integration of independently developed data sources.
Industrial data platforms shall enable and facilitate trusted and secure sharing and trading of proprietary/commercial data assets with automated and robust controls on compliance (including automated contracting) of legal rights and fair remuneration of data owners.
The actions are required to link to and bring in industrial data providers (not necessarily as consortium members) that will populate the platforms. Conditions of use and practical arrangements of data sharing should be regulated.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 4 and 6 million would allow this area to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
b) Research and Innovation Actions to advance the state of the art in the scalability and computational efficiency of methods for securing desired levels of privacy of personal data and/or confidentiality of commercial data, particularly when they are combined from multiple owners. Proposals shall also analyse and address, as appropriate, privacy/confidentiality threat models and/or incentive models for the sharing of data assets.
c) CSA proposals are invited to cover both of the following tasks:
Support the emergence of a data economy by ensuring SME inclusion, entrepreneurial support and trust-building, address the data skills gap. The CSA action shall liaise with and complement related initiatives[5], and shall support and work in collaboration with the platforms under ICT-13 a).
In line with the Communication on ICT Standardisation Priorities for the Digital Single Market[6], promote standardization, interoperability and policy support in the field of data and federated/networked computing systems.
One CSA will be funded. The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of EUR 3 million would allow this area to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
a) and b)
Personal data protection is improved, and compliance with the General Data Protection Regulation (and other relevant legislation) is made easier for economic operators
Citizens' trust is improved as privacy-aware transparency and control features are increasingly streamlined across data platforms and Big Data applications.
Better value-creation from personal and proprietary/industrial data.
20% annual increase in the number of data provider organisations in the personal and industrial data platforms
30% annual increase in the number of data user/buyer organisations using industrial data platforms
50% annual increase in number of users (data subjects) in the personal data platforms
20% annual increase in volume of business (turnover) channelled through the platforms
c)
Demonstrated success stories among clients as a result of the services offered by the CSA and at least 50 clients (e.g. start-ups, SMEs) served annually in partner finding, matchmaking, venture capital raising, training, coaching etc.

Today Europe fails to capitalise fully on participatory innovation; more models and blueprints are needed to lead to new ways to produce collective intelligence in key sustainability areas, leveraging on open data, knowledge networks, open hardware and Internet of things. The challenge is to demonstrate that innovative combinations of existing or emerging network technologies enable new Digital Social Innovation which can better cope with emerging sustainability challenges, achieving mass adoption and measurable global impact.
Scope:
a. Innovation Actions: pilots of Collective Awareness Platforms (CAPs) demonstrating new forms of bottom-up innovation and social collaboration exploiting digital hyper-connectivity and collaborative tools based on open data, open knowledge, open source software and open hardware, harnessing crowdsourcing or crowdfunding models. Within this vision, target areas for pilots include:
New participatory innovation models for economy and society, such as the collaborative or circular economy, collaborative public services and collaborative making;
Solutions for sustainable lifestyles such as collaborative consumption and production, smart reuse and low carbon approaches;
Emerging ethics of digital innovation, such as social entrepreneurship, direct democracy, privacy preservation and digital rights.
Proposals are expected to leverage on fresh grassroots ideas and civil society participation in the broad digital social innovation domain, and should:
Include in consortia an existing and motivated community of citizens, to drive platform development;
Base the platforms on an appropriate combination of existing or emerging network technologies (e.g. distributed social networks, wikis, sensors, blockchains);
Demonstrate a durable multidisciplinary collaboration by including in the consortia at least two entities whose main focus of interest is beyond the ICT domain.
Proposers are encouraged to integrate different platforms, addressing several sustainability challenges at a time, in order to achieve critical mass and measurable global impact.
Preference will be given to proposals engaging civil society at large, for instance through NGOs, local communities, social enterprises, non-profit organisations, students and hackers.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 1 and 2 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts. Minimum one action per target area will be selected.
b. Coordination and support Actions, to coordinate and support the CAPs initiative and the underlying broader digital social innovation constituency, by identifying links and synergies among different projects, and ensuring visibility and contacts at European and international level.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 0.2 and 0.8 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
Proposals should address as many as possible of the following criteria, possibly defining appropriate metrics to measure impact
Demonstrate increased effectiveness, compared to existing solutions to societal and sustainability challenges, of new bottom-up, open and distributed approaches exploiting network effects and based on open data and open hardware;
Capability to reach a critical mass of European citizens and to transpose the proposed approaches to other application areas related to sustainability;
Achieve effective involvement of citizens and relevant new actors in decision making, collective governance, new democracy models, self-regulation, citizen science and citizens' observatories, new business and economic models.
Achieve measurable improvement in cooperation among citizens, (including elderly), researchers, public authorities, private companies and civil society organisation in the development of new sustainable and collaborative consumption patterns, new lifestyles, and innovative product and service creation and information delivery.
Demonstrate the applicability of concrete and measurable indicators to assess the social impact and the ""social return of investment"" of the proposed solutions.

Deadline date","Scope:
Specific Challenge: The challenge is to harness the collaborative power of ICT networks (networks of people, of knowledge, of sensors) to create collective and individual awareness about the multiple sustainability threats which our society is facing nowadays at social, environmental and political levels. The resulting collective intelligence will lead to better informed decision-making processes and empower citizens, through participation and interaction, to adopt more sustainable individual and collective behaviours and lifestyles.
The challenge includes the deployment at larger scales of digital social platforms for multi-disciplinary groups developing innovative solutions to societal challenges.
Scope:
a.      Collective awareness pilots for bottom-up participatory innovation paradigms
Proposals are expected to develop and test pilot solutions to clearly defined sustainability challenges by harnessing 'network effects', leveraging on innovative combinations of distributed social networks, sensor networks and knowledge co-creation networks. Such scalable experiments and prototypes are expected to gain evidence and better understanding on the processes about collective awareness.
These pilots should be grounded on recent developments in open data, open source, distributed social networking and open hardware. Pilots must seize the full potential of existing mobile communications, integration of networks and online collaboration and can make use of innovative integrated mobile sensing devices to create collective awareness of risks and opportunities. They can pioneer crowdsourcing/crowdfunding solutions and new mechanisms for social innovation whose expected return goes beyond GDP measures and traditional success indicators[1].
Pilots should be user-driven, involving existing communities of people, and possibly addressing a combination of sustainability areas. Participants should include not only industry and academia but also local communities, grassroots activists, hackers, social entrepreneurs, students, citizens, creative industries and civil society organisations.
Consortia are expected to be multidisciplinary in nature: participation of at least two entities from domains different than ICT technologies (e.g. social sciences, psychology, economy, art, etc.) is required. 
Given their piloting nature, proposals are expected to be rather compact and small, even though projects including technology development and/or integration may require larger investments.
b.      Multidisciplinary research on collective awareness platforms (Internet Science)
Multidisciplinary research and development proposals will provide a better understanding of the obstacles and opportunities which are fundamental to the development of collective awareness platforms.
Areas of research include but are not limited to the motivations and incentives for online collaboration, the impact of extended awareness and peer pressure in driving more sustainable behaviours, defining online reputation mechanisms, and facilitating policy and technological developments addressing identity, anonymity, ethics, (user-centric) privacy preservation, monitoring of network neutrality, non-discriminatory access, collective governance (including Internet governance), new economic and value creation models beyond GDP, quality requirements for user-generated knowledge, visualisation of social interactions and trends.
Attention should also be paid on how to manage online communities in smart manners, in order to extract a ""wisdom of the crowds"" which appropriately takes into account the individual knowledgeability in specific fields.
Consortia are required to include at least two entities from domains different than ICT technologies. 
c.       Digital Social Platforms (DSP)
Digital Social Platforms will facilitate the transposition of existing or emerging participative and inclusive societal solutions to larger transnational scales through:
         engagement of additional stakeholders so far excluded from the innovation process (removing barriers for users at risk of exclusion and for those who consider themselves unsuited for participation),
         creation of concrete incentives for cooperation across countries and across domains, and
         raising awareness, at societal, political and technological levels, about the effectiveness and best practices of such solutions.
They can build on established and open multi-stakeholder networks and communities, such as European Innovation Partnerships, and apply a suitable ICT-enabled cooperative environment to support their expansion and governance, accelerating knowledge creation and innovation. Work should address bottom up innovation activities.
Proposals must address critical factors for successful demand-driven societal innovation, including new collaborative business models across established disciplines and borders. Findings should be transferable and scalable to other communities in different domains and societal challenges.
d.      Coordinating pilots and research activities in CAPs
The aim is to support and coordinate experimental and scientific activities in this field, to compare approaches and distil best practices, involving and networking stakeholders from a rich variety of application areas and disciplines, and bridging real world community-driven pilots of digital social platforms with multidisciplinary research (e.g. Internet Science). 
Expected impact:
At innovation level:
         Demonstration of the effectiveness, compared to existing solutions, of new bottom-up, open and distributed approaches exploiting network effects.
         Pioneering new promising models of participatory innovation based on open software, open data and open hardware.
         Capability to reach a critical mass and to transpose the proposed approach to other application areas related to sustainability.
         Effective involvement of citizens and relevant (and new) actors, as well as establishment of durable interdisciplinary collaborations in concrete application areas related to sustainability. Qualitative and quantitative indicators should be made available.
         (mostly for objective c:) Definition of new concepts and models for the development of digital social platforms, as well as their applicability to societal challenges and deeper understanding of social innovation processes.
At scientific level:
Evidence based understanding of the techno-social issues related to key aspects of the networked society; this impact can be amplified by the public availability of (privacy respecting) data collected in field trials organised by the pilots;

","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
The challenge consists of developing innovative solutions for the delivery of humanitarian aid based on frugal application of advanced technologies.
The European Union and its Member States are major humanitarian donors. Humanitarian crises and disasters have increased in number, complexity and severity over the last 25 years. Given the scale of today’s crises and disasters, funding to cover humanitarian needs cannot keep up. The humanitarian system is being challenged to do more, for more people, and at greater cost. Cooperation between international organisations and NGOs responding to crises, end-users and local actors, research and scientific communities and the private sector is crucial in this respect. Introducing innovative solutions for the delivery of humanitarian aid could help enhance the humanitarian response, which is particularly important for those in a most vulnerable situation.
Solutions should be developed through a frugal innovation approach, and should be novel and based on advanced technologies and services, demonstrating the added value and potential of one or more advanced technologies (not only limited to Information and Communication Technology). Tested and proven in humanitarian aid delivery, these solutions should be safe, scalable, resource-sustainable, replicable and usable in other contexts.
Innovative solutions should be inclusive, i.e. co-created and developed by different stakeholders with local actors, and accessible to a large number of people in a given context of humanitarian aid delivery settings.
The specific rules of the contest will be published in the fourth quarter of 2017 by the European Commission, which will directly launch and manage the contest and award the prize based on the judgement of independent experts. The indicative budget for this prize is €5 million from the 2020 budget. This is expected to be allocated in five awards of €1 million, each in a different area such as shelter, water and sanitation, energy, heating or cooling, food, hygiene and medical care.
Expected Impact:
More cost-effective, more sustainable and higher-quality innovative solutions, leading to an optimised use of humanitarian funding and an enhanced response to urgent needs in a humanitarian aid settings, notably for those in a most vulnerable situation, in areas such as shelter, water and sanitation, energy, heating or cooling, food, hygiene and medical care.

","single-stage
Deadline date","Scope:
Specific Challenge: The Internet architecture is fundamentally a ""host centric"" architecture, with limited ""in network"" service capability and static routing/addressing. Key functionalities like security, trust or mobility had not been planned in the original design. Additional service capabilities on the Internet have been made possible with overlay architectures or patches presenting inherent weaknesses. The ever larger portfolio of business models, processes, applications/devices that have to be supported, coupled with a rapidly growing number of application and societal requirements, calls for a new approach towards the Internet architecture, which will also bring computer architectures and network architectures closer for greater efficiency.
Multiple approaches have been researched: Information Centric Networks, Named Data Networking, Publish Subscribe information Networking, opportunistic and Disruption Tolerant Networking are a few of them, breaking the link between information and the physical network address where it is located. Recursive architectures have also been proposed, to better address security and trust issues and to reengineer the layered architecture.
The next wave of research in the field of Internet Architecture should solve remaining problems and bring the most promising options closer to deployment.
Scope: The focus of the research covers innovative Internet architectures and networking concepts that can meet the challenges and opportunities of the 21st century, taking into consideration the larger social, economic and legal issues that arise from the interplay between the Internet and society. The target research is thus expected to address novel approaches to information access and delivery, built-in security and privacy, generalised mobility, and seamless integration with computing environments as typical drivers. The proposed approach should go beyond fixing today's recognised limitations (e.g. ICN for content networking). It should also be adapted to future applications such as sensor based applications. A key target will be to prove that the proposed architecture does actually scale and makes possible a low cost migration strategy from existing IP networks. Comparative pilot experiments using virtualised platforms are encouraged.
Expected impact:
         Peer-reviewed scientific publications, patents, new PhDs, and new open source software releases. Key scientific publications like ACM Sigcomm will be targeted.
         Contributions to standards: IETF, IRTF may be targeted.
         Creation of a Future Internet architecture network of European researchers and users of sustainable nature, i.e. beyond the availability of public European research funds.
         Links with related International developments, e.g. with the US NSF Future Internet Architecture programme follow up and with similar programmes in Asia, notably Korea and Japan, supporting global views on open standards and interoperability.
         Migration/deployment strategies and roadmaps validated by key industrial players (operators/service providers) and the other stakeholders (regulators, policy makers) taking an active part in the development of the internet.
         Strengthen European industry for closer integration of datacom and telecom.
         Contribution towards at least one large scale validation trial.

","16 October 2018
","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Autonomy in robotic systems is built on a combination of four core technologies:
AI and Cognition: AI provides tools to make systems cognitive. Cognition equips robots with the ability to interact with people and environments, to learn and to categorise, to make decisions and to derive knowledge.
Cognitive Mechatronics: Mechatronic systems where sensing and actuation are closely coupled with cognitive systems are expected to deliver improved control, motion, interaction, adaptation and learning, and safer systems.
Socially cooperative human-robot interaction: Cooperative human-robot interaction is critical in many work environments from collaborative support, e.g. passing tools to a worker, to the design of exo-skeletons able to provide motion that is sympathetic to the user.
Model-based design and configuration tools: Deploying robotics at scale in application areas where tasks need to be defined by the user requires easy-to-use configuration tools. Embedding and sharing of knowledge between tools is essential, as is standardisation across the interfaces to connect systems and modules (taking into account cybersecurity issues, including security by design and data integrity).
Scope:
Proposals should address one of the four core technologies and target the development of core technology modules (modular, open and non-proprietary) and tool kits for use in deployable system platforms that meet the requirements of applications in the following four prioritised application areas: Healthcare, Infrastructure Inspection and Maintenance, Agri-Food and Agile Production. Proposals will be required to dedicate resource for connecting with the DIH actions arising from DT-ICT-02-2018.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between €5 million and €10 million would allow this area to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
Improved technical capability in each of the core technologies over the current state of the art.
A greater range of applications in the prioritised application areas that can be demonstrated at TRL 3 and above.
The lowering of technical barriers within the prioritised applications areas.

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
The activities under this topic will support technology-enabled multilingualism for an inclusive Digital Single Market. Every European should be able to access content and engage in written and spoken communication activities without language being a barrier. Content and services, such as those provided by public administrations, are not available in multiple languages. Linguistic fragmentation means that many citizens and businesses cannot fully engage in online activities and benefit from online content and services. The sheer volume of content, the diversity of content types and modalities as well as the diversity of languages in Europe makes the effective roll-out and provision of multilingual solutions challenging.
Scope:
The actions will address technological challenges (for language resources and interoperable language tools) and support coordination and networking by exploiting excellences and synergies with activities carried out in the Member States and Associated Countries. They will push research results to those who need them and support technology transfer and breakthroughs.
a) Innovation Action: A European Language Grid
The action shall:
i. develop the architecture and components for a public, open and interoperable grid connecting resources and tools, sharing and combining resources to support effective development and deployment of language technologies (software and services) across Europe. It shall provide easy access to basic natural language processing tools and services for European languages. The action shall cater for both consolidation of existing and a seamless inclusion of new resources and tools available for free or/and for a fee, enabling providers to control access rights reflecting their policies. The end-users of the grid shall be closely involved in the process.
ii. coordinate the work of the European Language grid and all actions supported under this topic and address the interoperability issues. It shall identify barriers for deploying multilingual services and establishing language infrastructure at European scale, including any skills gap. The action shall address legal and organisational obstacles, facilitate coordination between various European, national and regional activities through a structured dialogue and the establishment and exchange of best practices.
iii. pilot the European Language Grid in specific sectors of high commercial and/or societal impact, through small scale demonstrators geared towards an innovative integration of language technologies in specific operating processes/operations. The action shall provide facilities for collaboration, technical and linguistic guidance, access to open-source tools and open language resources (available through the grid), access to venture capital, and promotion and dissemination events. The results of all small scale demonstrators should be made available through the European Language grid under appropriate licensing conditions. The action shall select these small scale demonstrators through the use of financial support to third parties. Up to 30% of the EU funding of the action should be allocated to the financial support of these third parties, typically of the size of EUR 100 000 to 200 000 per third party[1] and a duration of about 9 to 12 months. Financial support to third parties should in line with the conditions set out in Part K of the General Annexes.
iv. establish competence centres / nodes in Member and Associated States. It shall build on the previous EC-funded actions within the FP7, H2020 and CEF[2].
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of about 7 million would allow this area to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
b) Research and Innovation Action: Domain-specific/challenge-oriented Human Language Technology.
The actions shall
Advance the state of art in Human Language Technologies through well-identified mission-oriented challenges involving researchers and industrial users of language technologies. Each proposal should address a specific sector of high commercial and/or societal impact or a technological challenge common/relevant to several sectors. Proposers should include a detailed analysis of the expected advances in terms of language technology-related research The actions should address concrete real-life issues defined by industrial users. The proposals must convincingly argue the demand for the proposed solution and provide clear indicators to benchmark the research results. The projects shall create a sustainable ecosystem of multilingual applications and services tailored for the specific needs of the addressed sector.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of about 3 million would allow this area to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
Provide European research and language technology industry with a better access to and usage of quality language resources and tools;
Increase in the quality and coverage of multilingual solutions used by industrial players in sectors relevant to the emergence of the Digital Single Market;
Increase in the uptake of language technologies in Europe in various sectors;

Specific Challenge: The evolution of the Internet of Things embedded in Smart Environments and Platforms forming a web of ""everythings"" has been identified as one of the next big concepts to support societal changes and economic growth at an annual rate estimated at 20%.
The overall challenge is to deliver an Internet of Things (IoT) extended into a web of platforms for connected devices and objects. They support smart environments, businesses, services and persons with dynamic and adaptive configuration capabilities.
The biggest challenge will be to overcome the fragmentation of vertically-oriented closed systems, architectures and application areas and move towards open systems and platforms that support multiple applications. The challenge for Europe is to capture the benefits from developing consumer-oriented platforms that require a strong cooperation between the telecom, hardware, software and service industries, to create and master innovative Internet Ecosystems.
This topic cuts across several LEIT-ICT challenges (smart systems integration, cyber-physical systems, smart networks, big data) and brings together different generic ICT technologies (nano-electronics, wireless networks, low-power computing, adaptive and cognitive systems) and their stakeholder constituencies. Their applicability across multiple application domains (e.g. ehealth, energy, food chain, intelligent transport and systems, environmental monitoring and logistics) bridges the gap to applications-specific developments under the H2020 Societal Challenges.
Scope: The scope is to create ecosystems of ""Platforms for Connected Smart Objects"", integrating the future generations of devices, embedded systems and network technologies and other evolving ICT advances. These environments support citizen and businesses for a multiplicity of novel applications. They embed effective and efficient security and privacy mechanisms into devices, architectures, service and network platforms, including characteristics such as openness, dynamic expandability, interoperability, dependability, cognitive capabilities and distributed decision making, cost and energy-efficiency, ergonomic and user-friendliness. Such Smart Environments may be enriched through the deployment of wearable /ambulatory hardware to promote seamless environments
The Smart Environment(s) will provide a basis and methodology for developer's communities to test and validate in large-scale experiments low cost applications of e.g. wireless networks such as WSNs, M2M, and networked objects and spaces, as well as heterogeneous deployments and should be driven by use cases.
a.      Research & Innovation Actions  are focussed on the following:
Architectural concepts and concepts for semantic interoperability for ""Platforms for Connected Smart Objects"", which can cover multiple use cases whilst responding to specific requirements in terms of security, dependability, cognition and prioritised event processing.
-       Dynamically configured infrastructure and integration platforms for ""Connected Smart Objects"" covering multiple technologies and multiple intelligent artefacts, potentially including robots, and heterogeneous integration levels; dynamically configured information representation and interpretation leading to an extended Internet of Things. Developments include aspects such as:
-       Efficient integration of the next generation of smart devices into self-adaptive, robust, safe, intuitive, affordable and interconnected smart network and service platforms. This includes Dynamic Spectrum Access and Network Management techniques to solve the connectivity challenges to enable tens of billions on new wireless connections for the IoT.
-       Provisioning of information processing/reasoning, potentially covering self-organising systems and autonomous behaviour.
-       Methods for flexible, reliable and interoperable APIs supporting the development of use cases and allowing application developers to produce new added value across multiple systems, including partial opt-out capabilities.
Reference implementations including proof-of-concept, large-scale demonstrations and validation driven by innovative use scenarios, also leveraging on platforms developed elsewhere in the programme[1]. Smart homes, workplaces, public spaces, context aware commercial environments and smart cities are targeted and potential use scenarios include health, energy, mobility and commercial services amongst others.
Proposals requesting a Large contribution are expected. The action may involve financial support to third parties in line with the conditions set out in Part K of the General Annexes. The consortium will define the selection process of additional users and suppliers for which financial support will be granted (typically in the order of EUR 50.000 – 150.000[2] per party).  Maximum 30% of the EU funding requested by the proposal should be allocated to this purpose.
b.      Support Measures
Measures for development of ecosystems driven by European players around the platforms e.g. communities of open API developers for low cost applications, networking of stakeholders, contribution to pre-normative activities and to standardisation, development of business models, innovation activities which aim at stimulating platform adoption (e.g. pre-commercial procurement), and activities to increase societal acceptance and foster specific education.
One Co-ordination and Support Action must stimulate the collaboration between selected projects and between the potential platforms. It will also derive exploitation strategies, on how to make successful ecosystems emerge, to involve the user in the development process and to respond to the societal challenges for Europe.
Expected impact:
Emergence of a European offer for integrated IoT systems and platforms with identified players capable of acting as technology and infrastructure integrators across multiple application sectors.
Availability of architectures and methodologies that can be used by integrators and SME's to provide IoT turnkey solutions in a variety of application fields.
Dissemination and availability of results for technology transfer and pre-normative activities e.g. in standardisation fora , open source initiatives and/or relevant bodies like the EIT.
         Facilitation of platforms for co-creation of products and services in open innovation ecosystems including all relevant stakeholders.

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
The rise of the digital era has brought novel immersive, accessible, and personalized user experiences to media, thereby disrupting traditional media. Today, media form a complex ecosystem of users and producers, audiences and performers with interchangeable roles where traditional boundaries of media are blurring. In this process, media has also become a key element in societal discourses. The challenge for the traditional media sectors is to compete in this extended ecosystem and to meet user expectations by rapidly embracing new technologies for creation, management, and distribution of content. The rise of digital also means that creative minds in culture including artists have an influential role in shaping the development or the use of technologies for media, as they are often being the first to embrace technological innovation in their work. Hence, another challenge for the media industry is to embrace these new viewpoints and actors.
Scope:
Innovative solutions 1) to facilitate the integration of emerging technologies such as 5G, Cloud, the Internet of Things, Virtual/Augmented Reality, smart objects, wearables, data analytics, artificial intelligence, etc. in next generation media that overcome traditional boundaries and sectors; 2) to help the new media ecosystem become more adaptive and inclusive, and better promote content, e.g. with new online strategies and business models or new forms of content creation/distribution/presentation; 3) to support synergies across media, operators, technologists and cultural/artistic actors, in order to develop a network of stakeholders which, building on the existing STARTS (Science+ Technology+ ARTS) network, will explore innovative paths for the next generation of media.
Proposals are invited against at least one of the following three subtopics:
a) Innovation Action (IA)
i. Business Innovation Ecosystems
Develop new business innovation ecosystems by using approaches, such as a sandbox, for technology-driven innovation in media, e.g. for new business models, through at least two incubators (project component), financed through the action and hosted in existing operational environments. These incubators have to be interlinked and should foster technology-driven innovation for open and interoperable media with a particular focus on SMEs and start-ups. The incubators shall also exploit synergies with non-media sectors. Each incubator will, through the project financing, host third party projects selected by open calls, provide access to relevant infrastructures and services as well as internal support. The action shall carry out two open calls, attracting submissions from at least from five different European regions (the first shall be entirely defined in the proposal; the second shall include the lessons learned from the first one). Typically, each third-party project will last from 5 to 12 months with a size from EUR 50.000 to 350.000[1]. Actions should provide specific, mentoring and coaching to third party projects, connect high-performers to the venture capital market through dedicated tasks, and cooperate with actions of the subtopic ii through a specific task).
At least 70% of the requested EU contribution shall be allocated to financial support for these third-party projects. Financial support to third parties should be in line with the conditions set out in Part K of the General Annexes. Criteria used to evaluate proposals should be clearly specified.
ii. New User Driven and Enriched Experiences in Future Media

Exploiting solutions for platforms enabling all-Internet Protocol content value chain and new business opportunities based on cross-media and cross-sectorial data analytics; for content distribution solutions that facilitate the availability of European content online, also tackling cross-border content restriction issues.
User driven, immersive and accessible media services;
Transmedia and cross media experiences and services;
Immersive and interactive experiences in publishing;
Agile media rights management and content identification solutions to improve online content distribution.
Subtopic ii. will cooperate and work closely with subtopic i. and vice-versa versa through a specific task.
b) Coordination and Support Action (CSA)
Starts – Technology and Arts Alliance as Driver for Next Generation Media
This subtopic will ensure a networked approach to next generation media that thrives from synergies of cultural, media and technology actors. The main activity is to create a network of actors from across Europe and if appropriate international partners (media industry, innovation hubs, technology and cultural/art institutions, civil society) to foster synergies between art, media and technology in order to create new uses and forms of media and employ media as a social catalyst; in the spirit of digital innovation hubs develop a strategy how to promote local art-technology centers and artist residencies that bring together these actors.
Additionally, this subtopic will support activities to organise the next annual European STARTS prizes that unites technology, arts and media. The support action will ensure publicizing the prize, handling of submission and evaluation in a scalable manner, and the award ceremony. There will be two annual prizes (EUR 20.000 each) covering different aspects of STARTS: one on artistic exploration where appropriation by the Arts has altered (the use, deployment, or perception of) technology and one on collaboration of ICT and the Arts (technological or artistic) that open new pathways for innovation and/or society in particular in context of regional development. Organize itinerant exhibitions and performances the will stimulate new alliances between art, technology and media and help promote novel role of media in societal context.
This action allows for the provision of financial support to third parties in the form of prize in line with the conditions set out in Part K of the General Annexes.
The Commission considers that proposals with an overall duration of 30 to 36 months and requesting a contribution from the EU of EUR 5.5 million for sub-topic a)i., EUR 5 million for sub-topic a)ii. and EUR 2 million for subtopic b) would allow this specific challenge to be appropriately addressed. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts. At least one proposal for subtopics a)i. and b), and two proposals for subtopic a)ii. will be selected.
Expected Impact:
Concrete development towards a user-driven and user-centric media value chain triggered by an alliance of media producers, media users, technology and cultural players.
Validated new media services tested in real operational environments.
Improved users’ experiences and new solutions for access to media content
Open and interoperable solutions enabling a genuine Digital Single Market for media.
Improvement of the technological transfer from European technological SMEs to the media value chain.
An enhanced and enriched media ecosystem.

","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
To ensure European strategic autonomy in such critical technology as AI, underpinning most of our future professional and private activities, with huge potential socio-economic impact, it is essential to reinforce and build on Europe’s assets in AI, including its world-class researcher community, in order to stay at the forefront of AI developments.
As stated in the communication from the European Commission on Artificial Intelligence for Europe and the coordinated action plan between the European Commission and the Member States, while Europe has undeniable strengths with its many leading research centres, efforts are scattered. Therefore joining forces will be crucial to be competitive at international level. Europe has to scale up existing research capacities and reach a critical mass through tighter networks of European AI excellence centres. The objective is to foster cooperation among the best research teams in Europe, joining forces to tackle more efficiently major scientific and technological challenges in AI hampering deployment of AI-based solutions.
Scope:
a) Research and Innovation Actions (RIA)
As announced in the Communication on Artificial Intelligence for Europe, the Commission will invest in strengthening AI research excellence centres across Europe and facilitate their collaboration and networking. The objective of this action is to develop networks of excellence centres aiming at boosting the research capacity in Europe and the status of Europe as a research powerhouse for AI, and making it attractive for scientists and new talents. This initiative is also expected to contribute to the development of ethical and trustworthy Artificial Intelligence, the trademark for AI “made in Europe”.
Such networks are expected to mobilise researchers to collaborate on key AI topics, to reach critical mass on these topics and to increase the impact of the funding in progressing faster in joined efforts rather than working in isolation, with fragmented and duplicated efforts.
Objectives of the Networks:
Up to four networks will be selected, focusing on scientific or technological major challenges, with the primary goal to reinforce Europe’s capacity and progress in critical technologies.
In addition, building on existing efforts by the AI-on-demand platform and in cooperation with the coordination and support action of this topic, these networks will develop mechanisms to spread the latest and most advanced knowledge to all the AI-labs in Europe and prepare the next generation of talent in AI. Such mechanisms will have to be defined in the proposal.
Another objective is also to develop synergies and cross-fertilization between industry and these networks of excellence centres, in particular through internships of academic staff (at all levels) in industry, or PhD programmes with industry.
The set of networks will form a common resource and will become shared facility, as a virtual laboratory offering access to knowledge and expertise and attracting the talents. It should become a reference, creating an easy entry point to AI excellence in Europe and should also be instrumental for its visibility.
Composition of the Networks:
Each network should be driven by leading figures in AI from major excellent research centers, bringing the best scientists distributed all over Europe. They will bring on board the necessary level of expertise and variety of disciplines and profiles to achieve their objectives.
Industrial participation will be ensured through industrial research teams and also in bringing expertise to identify important technological limitations hampering deployment in industrial context. Such industrial involvement will thus help defining the research priorities of the network and will raise new research questions.
Each network will have to demonstrate access to the required resources and infrastructure to support R&D, such as data, HPC (central, GPUs, edge computing), storage, robotics equipment, IoT infrastructure, support staff and engineers to develop experiments, etc. All available data sources, including Copernicus data where relevant, should be made use of.
Activities of the Networks: for each of the following activities, the most appropriate mechanisms should be selected and detailed in the proposal:
In order to structure the activities, the proposals will focus on important scientific or technological challenges with industrial relevance and where Europe will make a difference, either in building on strengths, or strengthening knowledge to fill gaps critical for Europe.
Based on these challenges, the networks will develop and implement common research agendas. The main vision and roadmap with targets within the projects, as well as methodology to implement and monitor progress will have to be specified in the proposal and can be further developed during the project.
Progress will be demonstrated in the context of use-cases, also helping to foster industry-academia collaboration.
Strong links will be developed among the members of the networks, notably through collaborative projects, exchange programmes, or other mechanisms to be defined by the consortia
The proposals should define mechanisms to foster excellence, to increase efficiency of collaboration, and to develop a vibrant AI network in Europe.
Each network will disseminate the latest and most advanced knowledge to all the academic and industrial AI laboratories in Europe, and involving them in collaborative projects/exchange programmes. (This could involve projects defined initially or via financial support to third parties[1][2], for maximum 20% of the requested EU contribution).
Each network will develop interactions with the industry (inside the consortium and beyond), in view of triggering new scientific questions and fostering take-up of scientific advances
Each network will develop collaboration with the relevant Digital innovation Hubs, to disseminate knowledge and tools, and understand their needs.
Proposals will include common academic/industrial PhD programmes and post-PhD programmes with a focus on industrial challenges. The ambition is to establish a unique and world-recognised brand for a European programme for industrially-oriented PhDs in AI and to keep researchers in Europe after they complete their PhDs.
These networks should also foster innovation and include mechanisms to exploit new ideas coming out of the network’s work (for instance via incubators).
Overall, each proposal will define mechanisms to become a virtual center of excellence, offering access to knowledge and serve as a reference in their chosen specific field, including activities to ensure visibility.
Technology focus:
Collaborative projects carried out in networks should focus on one or several of the following topics and would involve the necessary competencies available in the network to address these:
Advances in foundations of AI (e.g.: learning and reasoning approaches) and approaches for trusted AI solutions (including explainable AI, unbiased AI, safety, reliability, verifiability etc.),
Developing the next generation of intelligent robots,
Advanced perception or interaction with humans (for human-centered AI) and environments,
AI at the edge and hardware for AI.
Synergies with the AI-on-Demand platform:
The AI-on-demand platform should serve as the backbone of these networks in:
Providing tools and algorithms, data, support services, also to the research community;
Establishing the link to the community at large in order to spread the knowledge and develop collaborations.
The networks will aim at strengthening the AI-on-Demand-platform in enriching its capacity in terms of tools, competencies, services, to make it the reference and quality label for resource in AI. Being the one-stop-shop for AI resource in Europe, the tools, algorithms, resources developed in the networks of excellent centres will be made available to all via the AI-on-Demand platform.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of up to EUR 12 million would allow this area to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
b) Coordination and Support Action (CSA)
The coordination and support action will help develop synergies and exchange between the selected projects, and with other relevant projects, such as the AI-on-demand platform, and the community at large, both academic and industrial. It will support the running projects in allowing economies of scales regarding common activities run by the individual networks (e.g.: organization of events, logistics support for calls for FSTP, exchange mechanisms among labs, etc.), exchanges of best practices to reinforce and optimize cooperation, etc.
It is also expected to support the RIA projects in their dissemination activities towards industry, users, and citizens. Diversity and gender aspects should be addressed, when relevant.
In addition, due to the importance of equipping the professionals with the right skills in order to maximise the benefits offered by AI-based system, this action will support the academia, in cooperation with industry, via organisation of workshops, and other appropriate approaches, to identify AI courses and modules that could be integrated in non-ICT education master programmes, and corresponding mechanisms to foster such integration.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of up to EUR 2 million would allow this area to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
Make Europe a research powerhouse for AI;
Increase Europe's attractiveness for scientists, so that it notably becomes the nest for future generations of scientists and breakthrough in AI;
Ensure Europe's leadership in key strategic research topics,
Strengthen the AI-on-Demand platform with algorithms, tools solutions developed by the actions funded under this topic;
Foster mobilization and commitment from the community, including high level experts to contributing to the AI-on-Demand platform, making it the reference resource for European researchers, developers, integrators and users;
Reinforce Europe’s research capacity in AI;
Pave the way to enrich the education offer in order to equip a broad range of non-ICT professionals with the necessary AI skills, to make the best of this technology.

","19 November 2019
","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
The challenge is to fully exploit the potential of AI in the economy and society. Building notably on Europe's Scientific and Technology strengths in the field, the supported activities should reinforce industrial competitiveness across all sectors including for SMEs and non-tech industries and help address societal challenges (e.g. ageing, transport, gender equality). The ambition is to bring AI technologies and resources to integrators and innovators in all sectors and actively engage with a wide user community, to foster adoption of AI, via use-cases experiments.
AI-on-demand platform: consolidation and exploitation ­­
Scope:
This topic builds on the AI-on-demand-platform funded in ICT26-2018-20, a reference access point gathering and providing access to AI-related knowledge, algorithms and tools and access to related infrastructures, equipment, and data resources, offering also experts support to potential users of AI in order to facilitate the integration of AI into applications, making it a compelling solution for users, especially from non-tech sectors.
This activity aims at consolidating the eco-system by bringing in a larger user community, especially from the non-tech sector, and by reinforcing the service layer of the platform. At this stage, it will be particularly important to refine mechanisms to ensure the platform's long-term sustainability. The platform should provide a good European coverage, both in terms origin of the resources made available on the platform, but also in terms of users of the platform, making sure its resource is available everywhere in Europe.
The objectives:
Reinforce the service layer of the AI-on-demand-platform funded in ICT26-2018-20 to facilitate the use and uptake of the platform resources.
Reaching out to new user domains and boosting the use of the platform through use cases and small-scale experiments. The task will involve financial support to third parties, in line with the conditions set out in part K of the General Annexes. Minimum EUR 2 million funding should be dedicated to it, with EUR 50.000 to 200.000 per third party (amount higher than EUR 60.000[1]should be justified, based on need of expensive hardware or infrastructure for instance). The selection process should prioritise projects maximising the impact of the platform and demonstrating the benefit of AI in products, processes or services. Particular attention will be paid to SMEs and low-tech sector, which can best benefit from the support offered by the platform. The selected projects should also cover a wide spread of application sectors, to demonstrate the versatility and scalability of the platform offer.
Proposals will ensure continuity with the project selected under ICT26-2018-20, having access to all the knowledge and offer needed to fully exploit it and be able to build on it. The improvements resulting from the selected projects should be made available and open to the community via the platform, to allow full exploitation, and also further developments by entities outside the consortia, building on these results.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of up to EUR 5 million would allow this area to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
Enriching and optimising the AI on-demand platform service offer and reinforcing its sustainability
Boosting the deployment of AI-based solutions and services, enabling a larger user community to reap the economic benefits of AI, especially SMEs and non-technology sectors

","Research and Innovation action
","09 July 2019
","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
The Next Generation Internet initiative aims at developing a more human-centric Internet supporting values of openness, decentralisation, inclusiveness and protection of privacy and giving the control back to the end-users, in particular of their data. It should provide more transparent and accessible services, more intelligence, greater involvement and participation, leading towards an Internet that is a true engine of growth and social progress.
Blockchain and distributed ledger technologies (DLT)[1] have the potential to enable more decentralised, trusted, user-centric digital services, and stimulate new business models benefiting society and the economy as stressed by the European Parliament resolution on the topic[2]. These technologies will create opportunities to enhance services and processes in both the public and private sectors, notably providing better control of data by citizens and organisations, reducing fraud, improving recordkeeping, access, transparency and auditability, within and across borders. As a key component of the Next Generation Internet initiative, the specific challenge is to foster research and innovation at technology, infrastructure and application levels to position Europe at the forefront of the blockchain revolution.
This topic contributes to the European Commission strategy on blockchain. The first milestones of this strategy were the launch of the European Blockchain Observatory and Forum[3], which aims to accelerate blockchain innovation and the development of the blockchain ecosystem within the EU, and the European Blockchain Partnership, signed by 26 Member States and Norway, to cooperate in the establishment of a European Blockchain Services Infrastructure.
The Research and Innovation Actions mentioned below are complemented by a blockchain pre-commercial procurement action, which is presented under the “Other actions” part of the Work Programme.
Scope:
Research and Innovation Actions (RIA) will be called for in the following three sub-topics. Proposals should address only one of these sub-topics.
i. Advancing research on Blockchain and Distributed Ledger Technologies
Conducting research, proofs of concepts, piloting, testing and benchmarks to improve and further develop advanced blockchain technologies, for example regarding energy efficiency and sustainability, consensus protocols, a priori usage control, scalability and throughput, security, privacy, robustness, interoperability, cryptography, smart contracts, governance, compliance to regulatory frameworks. This action should contribute to standardisation activities.
ii. Fostering trust in internet information exchange and content with blockchain
Develop decentralised blockchain-based solutions that can be scaled in a sustainable manner, combined with the use of trustworthy electronic identification, authentication and verified pseudonyms, to preserve the integrity and reliability of information and content, including the underlying sources, on the internet. Two use cases: a) develop and implement new transparent and accountable reputation-based models to increase trustworthiness of the information exchange on the internet and social networks and b) provide solutions for transparency, trustworthy transactional content handling, on the internet and social networks.
iii. Bringing forward the emergence of collective intelligence on the internet:
Develop approaches for scientific understanding and technology-based stimulation of collective intelligence on social media and the internet to foster trustworthy knowledge and information sharing, and to enhance social inclusion. Two use cases: a) develop new community-based service models on social networks that exploit collective intelligence to provide enhanced community services, and increase the availability of trustworthy content and b) in the context of collective intelligence develop and implement new concepts for connecting people and smart objects/agents/AI on social media. Approaches for both use cases must be rooted in scientific analysis of collective behaviour (taking into account gender difference, where relevant) and network mechanisms, harness decentralised technologies such as P2P or blockchain for governance and support a dependable collective memory.
Each RIA in the three sub-topics above, through an agile and flexible process, will support third party projects from outstanding academic research groups, hi-tech startups, SMEs and other multidisciplinary actors, so that multiple third parties will be funded in parallel contributing to the research and innovation area. The RIA will provide the programme logic and vision for the third-party projects, ensure the coherence and coordination of these projects, provide the necessary technical support, as well as coaching and mentoring, in order that the collection of third party projects contributes towards a significant advancement and impact in the research domain. The focus will be on applied research that is linked to relevant use cases and that can be further developed into viable solutions. Apps and services that innovate without a research component are not covered by this model.
Beneficiaries shall make explicit the intervention logic for their specific sub-topic, their capacity to attract relevant top talents, to deliver a solid value-adding services package to the third-party projects, as well as their expertise and capacity in managing the full life-cycle of the open calls transparently. They should explore synergies with other research and innovation actions, supported at regional, national or European level, to increase the overall impact.
RIAs should encourage open source software and open hardware design, open access to data, standardisation activities, access to testing and operational infrastructure as well as an IPR regime ensuring lasting impact and reusability of results.
For grants awarded under this topic for Research and Innovation actions beneficiaries may provide support to third parties as described in part K of the General Annexes of the Work Programme. The support to third parties can only be provided in the form of grants. The respective options of Article 15.1 and Article 15.3 of the Model Grant Agreement will be applied.
The Commission considers that proposals with an overall duration of 24 to 36 months and requesting a contribution from the EU of EUR 8 million for sub-topic i); and EUR 6 million for each sub-topic ii) and iii) would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other durations or amounts. As the primary purpose of the action is to support and mobilise internet innovators, a minimum of 70% of the total requested EU contribution should be allocated to financial support to the third parties. For ensuring focused effort, third parties will be funded through projects typically in the EUR 50 000 to 200 000 range per project, with indicative duration of 12 months.
In line with Article 23 (7) of the Rules for Participation, the amounts referred to in Article 204-205 of the Financial Regulation may be exceeded in order to achieve the objective of the action up to a maximum funding per third party of EUR 500 000.
Expected Impact:
Proposals should provide appropriate metrics for the claimed impacts.
Shape a more human-centric evolution of the Internet.
For sub-topic i): Reinforcing the European Blockchain ecosystem and excellence in research.
For sub-topic ii): Scalable blockchain based solutions for ensuring trustworthy content and information exchange
For sub-topic iii): Service models for community services building on collective intelligence and novel approaches for connecting people and smart objects/agents to stimulate use of collective intelligence
Promoting interoperability and strengthening the role of Europe in international standardisation.

","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
European researchers need effective and convenient access to the best research infrastructures in order to conduct research for the advancement of knowledge and technology. The aim of this action is to bring together, integrate on European scale, and open up key national and regional research infrastructures to all European researchers, from both academia and industry, ensuring their optimal use and joint development.
Scope:
A 'Starting Community' has never been supported for the integration of its infrastructures under FP7 or Horizon 2020 calls, in particular within an integrating activity.
An Integrating Activity will mobilise a comprehensive consortium of several key research infrastructures in a given field as well as other stakeholders (e.g. public authorities, technological partners, research institutions) from different Member States, Associated Countries and other third countries[1] when appropriate, in particular when they offer complementary or more advanced services than those available in Europe.
Funding will be provided to support, in particular, the trans-national and virtual access provided to European researchers (and to researchers from Third Countries under certain conditions[2]), the cooperation between research infrastructures, scientific communities, industry and other stakeholders, the improvement of the services the infrastructures provide, the harmonisation, optimisation and improvement of access procedures and interfaces. Proposals should adopt the guidelines and principles of the European Charter for Access to Research Infrastructures.
To this extent, an Integrating Activity shall combine, in a closely co-ordinated manner:
(i) Networking activities, to foster a culture of co-operation between research infrastructures, scientific communities, industries and other stakeholders as appropriate, and to help develop a more efficient and attractive European Research Area;
(ii) Trans-national access or virtual access activities, to support scientific communities in their access to the identified key research infrastructures;
(iii) Joint research activities, to improve, in quality and/or quantity, the integrated services provided at European level by the infrastructures.
All three categories of activities are mandatory as synergistic effects are expected from these different components.
Access should be provided only to key research infrastructures of European interest, i.e., those infrastructures able to attract significant numbers of users from countries other than the country where they are located. Other national and regional infrastructures in Europe can be involved, in particular in the networking activities, for the exchange of best practices, without necessarily being beneficiaries in the proposal.
The research infrastructures of a 'Starting Community' usually show a limited degree of coordination and networking at present. The strongest impact of an integrating activity is expected typically to arise from a focus on networking, standardisation and establishing a common access procedure for trans-national and/or virtual access provision.
In line with the strategy for EU international cooperation in research and innovation (COM(2012)497), Integrating Activities should, whenever appropriate, pay due attention to any related international initiative (i.e. outside the EU) and foster the use and deployment of global standards.
Integrating Activities should also organise the efficient curation, preservation and provision of access to the data collected or produced under the project, defining a data management plan, even when they opt out of the extended Pilot on Open Research Data. Data management (including ethics and privacy issues), interoperability, as well as advanced data and computing services should be addressed where relevant. To this extent, proposals should build upon the state of the art in ICT and e-infrastructures for data, computing and networking, and ensure connection to the European Open Science Cloud.
Integrating Activities should, when relevant, contribute to fostering the potential for innovation, including social innovation, of research infrastructures by reinforcing the partnership with industry, public administrations and/or other stakeholders, through e.g. transfer of knowledge and other dissemination activities, activities to promote the use of research infrastructures by industrial researchers or policy-makers, involvement of industrial associations and other stakeholders in consortia or in advisory bodies.
Integrating Activities are expected to duly take into account all relevant ESFRI and other world-class research infrastructures to exploit synergies, to reflect on sustainability and to ensure complementarity and coherence with the existing European Infrastructures landscape.
Proposals should include clear indicators allowing the assessment of the progress towards the general and specific objectives, other than the access provision.
As the scope of an integrating activity is to ensure coordination and integration between all the key European infrastructures in a given field and to avoid duplication of effort, at most one proposal per field is expected to be submitted.
Further conditions and requirements that applicants should fulfil when drafting a proposal are given in part D of the section “Specific features for Research Infrastructures”. Compliance with these provisions will be taken into account during evaluation.
Integrating activities for starting communities range across all areas of science and technology. Proposals should not restrict their services to too narrow research fields and should address the wider scientific communities, even multidisciplinary ones, which can be served by the involved sets of research infrastructures.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of up to EUR 5 million would allow this topic to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
Researchers will have wider, simplified, and more efficient access to the best research infrastructures they require to conduct their research, irrespective of location. They benefit from an increased focus on user needs.
New or more advanced research infrastructure services, enabling leading-edge or multidisciplinary research, are made available to a wider user community.
Operators of related infrastructures develop synergies and complementary capabilities, leading to improved and harmonised services. , . Economies of scale and improved use of resources across Europe are also realised due to less duplication of services, common development and the optimisation of operations.
When applicable, innovation is fostered through a reinforced partnership of research infrastructures with industry.
A new generation of researchers is educated that is ready to optimally exploit all the essential tools for their research.
Closer interactions between larger number of researchers active in and around a number of infrastructures facilitate cross-disciplinary fertilisations and a wider sharing of information, knowledge and technologies across fields and between academia and non-academic stakeholders, including industry.
The integration of major scientific equipment or sets of instruments and of knowledge-based resources (collections, archives, structured scientific information, data infrastructures, etc.) leads to a better management of the continuous flow of data collected or produced by these facilities and resources.
When applicable, the integrated and harmonised access to resources at European level can facilitate the use beyond research and contribute to evidence-based policy making.
When applicable, the socio-economic impact of past investments in research infrastructures from the European Structural and Investment Funds is enhanced.

Deadline date","Scope:
Specific challenge: European researchers need effective and convenient access to the best research infrastructures in order to conduct research for the advancement of knowledge and technology. The aim of this action is to bring together, integrate on European scale, and open up key national and regional research infrastructures to all European researchers, from both academia and industry, ensuring their optimal use and joint development.
Scope: An Integrating Activity will mobilise a comprehensive consortium of several research infrastructures  in a given field as well as other stakeholders (e.g. public authorities, technological partners, research institutions) from different Member States, Associated Countries and other third countries when appropriate. Funding will be provided to support, in particular, the trans-national and virtual access activities provided to European researchers (and of researchers from Third Countries under certain conditions), the cooperation between research infrastructures, scientific communities, industries and other stakeholders, the improvement of the services the infrastructures provide, the harmonisation, optimisation and improvement of access procedures and interfaces. An Integrating Activity shall combine, in a closely co-ordinated manner:
(i) Networking activities, to foster a culture of co-operation between research infrastructures, scientific communities, industries and other stakeholders as appropriate, and to help developing a more efficient and attractive European Research Area; (ii) Trans-national access or virtual access activities, to support scientific communities in their access to the identified research infrastructures; (iii) Joint research activities, to improve, in quality and/or quantity, the integrated services provided at European level by the infrastructures.
 All three categories of activities are mandatory as synergistic effects are expected from these different components. However, the focus among these categories will differ for 'Starting' and 'Advanced' Communities (see definitions below).Integrating Activities should, whenever appropriate, give due attention to any related initiatives internationally (i.e. outside the EU), foster the use and deployment of standards, carry out research on impacts of the involved research infrastructures (direct and indirect, on social, environmental and economic levels) as well as of the project itself. Integrating Activities should also organise the efficient curation, preservation and provision of access to the data collected or produced under the project, defining a data management plan. Data management, interoperability (definition of metadata and ontologies) as well as advanced data and computing services should be addressed where relevant. To this extent, proposals should build upon the state of the art in ICT and e-infrastructures for data, computing and networking, and either work in cooperation with e-infrastructure service providers or include them in the consortium.Integrating Activities in particular should contribute to fostering the potential for innovation, including social innovation, of research infrastructures by reinforcing the partnership with industry, through e.g. transfer of knowledge and other dissemination activities, activities to promote the use of research infrastructures by industrial researchers, involvement of industrial associations in consortia or in advisory bodies. A specific work package on innovation is therefore recommended in all Integrating Activity proposals.
In this work programme, Integrating Activities address two classes of different communities:
(1) 'Starting Communities' whose research infrastructures show a limited degree of coordination and networking at present. The strongest impact for these communities will be expected typically to arise from a focus on networking, standardisation and establishing a common access procedure, which lay the foundation for well-used trans-national and virtual access provision. The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of up to EUR 5 million would allow this topic to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.(2) 'Advanced Communities' whose research infrastructures show an advanced degree of coordination and networking at present, in particular, through Integrating Activities awarded under previous Framework Programmes. The strongest impact for these communities will be expected typically to arise from focusing on innovation aspects and on widening trans-national and virtual access provision. Proposals from Communities that have benefitted from EU funding for Integrating Activities before will have to clearly demonstrate the added value and the progress beyond current achievements of a continuation project. The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of up to EUR 10 million would allow this topic to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
In both cases, Integrating Activities are expected to duly take into account all relevant ESFRI research infrastructures to exploit synergies and to ensure that rationally designed, comprehensive and coherent overall concepts for European Infrastructures are being pursued. As the scope of an integrating activity is to ensure coordination and integration between all the key European infrastructures in a given field and to avoid duplication of effort, at most one proposal per area is expected to be funded.Further conditions and requirements that applicants should fulfil when drafting a proposal are given in part D of the section “Specific features for Research Infrastructures”. Compliance to these provisions will be taken into account during evaluation.Following an open bottom-up consultation with stakeholders and the analysis of the collected input by a panel of independent experts, this work programme calls for proposals addressing one or, where appropriate, more of the following areas listed under the different domains:
Biological and Medical Sciences - Starting CommunitiesHealth information, clinical data, samples and medical images – support to population studies. This activity aims at integrating medical information, clinical data, human biological samples and imaging data generated by hospitals, health care and study centres, so as to support large cohort studies in given target population and disease areas as well as personalised and patient stratification approaches for prevention and treatment. Operational interfaces should allow efficient and sustained flow of data, samples and images from and to established European infrastructures, such as the ESFRI ones (e.g. BBMRI, ECRIN, EURO-BIOIMAGING and ELIXIR) and give user-friendly access to these research resources while following applicable ethical requirements. Standardisation of data acquisition and analysis, in particular for imaging data, interoperability and storage aspects are amongst the issues to be addressed.
New tools and resources for analysing and integrating genomic, epigenomic, proteomic, metabolomic and phenomic data.  This activity should link genomics, epigenomics, proteomics, metabolomics and phenomics resources related to animal, plant and micro-organisms, derived from sectors such as health, food, energy and the environment, and provide user-friendly tools to exploit this data for research and innovation. Access and training activities should ensure the optimum use of these tools and resources. The proposal should integrate existing European research infrastructures active in generating and handling such biological data, and exploit synergies with ELIXIR and other relevant ESFRI infrastructures such as INFRAFRONTIER, ISBE,  and MIRRI.
Plant and forestry material resources. This activity should integrate European research facilities working with plant including forestry materials, such as seed and tree banks, to provide researchers with wider and better informed access to high quality plant material, and ensure wide use of advanced technology platforms supporting crop biology, forestry, and agricultural and horticultural research in a wider sense. Synergies with relevant ESFRI infrastructures, such as ELIXIR and EMBRC, should be duly exploited.
European nanomedicine characterisation  infrastructure. This activity aims at integrating European key reference facilities that have the capability to both characterise and engineer nanoparticles for medical applications. It should offer access to a coherent set of tools, resources and expertise to support chemical, physical and biological research on medical applications, supporting both academic research teams and industry (including SMEs). Synergies with relevant ESFRI Infrastructures, such as EATRIS, EURO-BIOIMAGING,INSTRUCT, and INFRAFRONTIER should be duly exploited.
Research infrastructures supporting rare diseases research. This activity aims at integrating sufficient amounts of information and data concerning patients suffering from rare diseases, in order to enable the study of the aetiology of these diseases, the monitoring of their epidemiology and the development and test of diagnostic tools and preventive and therapeutic interventions. Synergies with relevant ESFRI Infrastructures, such as BBMRI, ECRIN, EATRIS, INFRAFRONTIER, EuroBioImaging, ELIXIR, and EU-OPENSCREEN, should be duly exploited.
Biological and Medical Sciences - Advanced CommunitiesHigh-containment biosafety facilities and virus collections including for high-risk animal/human pathogens. This activity aims at improving the access to high-quality authenticated collections of both human and animal viruses including those requiring high-biosafety level laboratories (BSL 3 and 4), to support upstream virology, microbiology and immunology research as well as translational research aiming at drug and vaccine development, and to support epidemiological studies targeting disease and epidemics control. Giving safe access to high risk virus collections, including providing the necessary training, should be complemented with high containment animal facilities to allow to safely study livestock and transboundary zoonotic diseases. Synergies with relevant ESFRI Infrastructures, such as BBMRI, ERINHA, MIRRI, and EBMRC, should be duly exploited.
Vaccine infrastructures. This activity aims at bridging the 'translational gap' in biomedical research by providing academia- and SME- driven vaccine R&D with easily accessible, high quality services and expertise to support vaccine formulation, access to GMP (Good Manufacturing Practices), preclinical studies including relevant animal models, vaccine trials, compilation of regulatory dossiers and advice on production issues like upscale and quality control. This activity should support the development of both human and veterinary vaccines, for prophylactic and therapeutic applications. Synergies with relevant ESFRI Infrastructures, such as EATRIS, ISBE, ECRIN, INFRAFRONTIER, and INSTRUCT, should be duly exploited.
Research Infrastructures for translating research on biological structures into innovation in biomedicine. This activity should expand the availability of structural biology services (such as X-ray and neutron scattering, advanced NMR and advanced imaging technologies) to new communities of users, and in particular to scientists with backgrounds other than structural biology, including from SMEs, to benefit translational research in drugs discovery, informed drugs and vaccine design and other fields like biotechnology and biomaterials. Synergies with relevant ESFRI Infrastructures, such as INSTRUCT, EUROBIOIMAGING, EU-OPENSCREEN, and EATRIS, should be duly exploited.
Research infrastructures in aquaculture. This activity aims at integrating highly diverse aquaculture research facilities and providing to research teams easy access to them. Specific attention should be given to dedicated facilities for new species, disease aspects, links to high-throughput sequencing and contribution to sustainable aquaculture. Synergies with relevant ESFRI Infrastructures, such as EMBRC, should be duly exploited.
Energy - Starting Communities European facilities for electrochemical energy storage testing. This activity aims at integrating and providing access to research infrastructures supporting research on electrochemical storage devices for renewable energy (such as dry room facilities for assembly of lab cells series, electron microscopy combined with chemical analysis and calorimetric analysis, neutron and x-ray techniques and test rigs). It should support an integrated research approach along the entire value chain, from materials research to applications.
Testing of wind turbines, ocean energy converters and electrical subsystems for grid integration under laboratory conditions. This activity aims at supporting the precompetitive research that is needed to address the challenges that wind and ocean energy creates for the electrical grid, by promoting coordination within the European community and by providing access to research infrastructures, regardless of their location.
Energy - Advanced CommunitiesEuropean smart grids research infrastructure. The transition towards high shares of renewable energy and the tendency to a more decentralised energy supply requires a grid with sufficient hosting capacity and the ability to manage the power fluctuation of the renewable sources. This activity should provide laboratory environments that enable the testing of different smart grid configurations considering different scenarios under safe boundary conditions without influencing end-customers of the electrical power supply.
Environmental and Earth Sciences - Starting Communities Research infrastructures for hydrological/ hydrobiological research. This activity should bring together existing observatories of European freshwaters (river basins, continental, island and overseas territories) covering both abiotic and biotic components, i.e. addressing hydrological, hydrometeorological, sedimental, morphological and hydrochemical aspects as well as biological/ecological indicators of water quality. Water Framework Directive objectives should be considered and access to the infrastructures should be clearly defined.
Research infrastructures for research on crustal fluids and geo-resources. This activity should link the key European analogue experimental, numerical, and observational (imaging)   facilities in providing an additional underpinning pillars to EPOS (European Plate Observing System). Appropriate links with the ICDP (International Continental Scientific Drilling Program) should be made.
Research infrastructures for long-term ecosystem and socio-ecological research. This activity should bring together LTER (Long Term Ecological Research) site-based and properly instrumented facilities and critical zone observatories, covering the widest variety of terrestrial and aquatic environments in Europe (wherever reasonable organised in clusters). It should incorporate long-term socio-ecological research platforms as well as integrate research field sites, associated data management and numerical simulation tools in order to address threats to soil and water and in particular challenges on urbanisation, land use, and food security. The provided access and services should enable researchers addressing the broad range of ecosystem research issues (biodiversity loss, ecosystem services, climate change adaptation and mitigation, land use and management, etc.). Appropriate links with the LIFEWATCH infrastructure for biodiversity research should be made.
Research infrastructures for ocean drilling. This activity should develop a unique EU component for scientific research drilling. It should integrate with IODP (Integrated Ocean Drilling Program) and share technology (drilling and logging, sample and data curation) with ICDP. It should link with EMSO (European Multidisciplinary Seafloor Observation) and other crustal boreholes in creating underground and subseafloor observatory network. It should foster involvement of and links with industry in underpinning joint research projects.
Environmental and Earth Sciences - Advanced CommunitiesAerosol, clouds, and trace gases research infrastructure. This activity should further integrate state-of-the-art European ground-based stations for long term observations of aerosols, clouds and short lived gases that are essential to climate and air-quality research. New integration tools and long-term sustainability should be addressed, in particular by linking with appropriate ESFRI projects.
Research infrastructures for environmental hydraulic research. This activity should integrate the major rare/unique environmental hydraulic infrastructures in Europe and network with the other European hydraulic infrastructures in order to optimise their use to help solve climate change adaptation problems. Particular attention to harmonising and organising the flux of data is expected.
Research infrastructures for terrestrial research in the Arctic. This activity should integrate, as an international network for terrestrial research and monitoring in the Arctic, key research stations and large research field sites throughout the circumpolar Arctic and adjacent northern countries, aiming at implementing capacity for research, monitoring and education. The network should link with marine and atmospheric networks, aiming at close cooperation.
Research infrastructures for forest ecosystem and resources research. This activity aims at integrating and facilitating broad access to forest research facilities and methodologies with a view to enabling, coordinating and harmonising research and monitoring including investigation of the biological effects of air pollution and mitigation and adaptation to climate change. Access should be provided to data on genetic and species diversity in forest ecosystems. Support for development of forest management approaches should be part of the project, taking into account environmental and land use changes and the bioeconomy.
Research Infrastructures for integrated and sustained coastal observation. This activity should further harmonise observation techniques in several European coastal and shelf seas, integrating key observing platforms as well as developing further the collection of biological data, in particular exploiting synergies with marine biological observatories. It should link with appropriate ESFRI projects such as EURO-ARGO, EMSO and EMBRC and aim at a single European channel for all physical, chemical and biological coastal data.
Mathematics and ICT - Starting CommunitiesDistributed, multidisciplinary European infrastructure on Big Data and social data mining. This activity should integrate large social data repositories, social data mining methods and tools, and supercomputing facilities for conducting large-scale analytical processing.

Large-scale testing facilities for engineering applications. This activity aims at improving and providing access to the European research infrastructures such as wind tunnels and other industrial test benches for transport and particularly for aeronautics, including support for developing future norms for public transportation and safety.
Physical Sciences - Starting Communities  European laboratory astrophysics. Laboratory Astrophysics is a rapidly growing field, not least because the knowledge of fundamental physical properties and processes at nuclear, atomic and molecular levels is crucial for the interpretation of data from ground- and space-based observatories as well as solar-system probes. This activity aims at coordinating and integrating joint efforts of separate laboratories, for all aspects of generation, collection, distribution, curation, and access to data or samples. Links with the respective ESFRI projects in astrophysics (like CTA and SKA) should be established.
Research infrastructures for high-energy astrophysics. This activity aims at opening up existing facilities for developing, calibrating and testing both generic technologies as well as individual instruments developed for space missions in an environment representative of space conditions. Access should be provided in particular to scientists without national access to testing and calibration facilities, at the same time stimulating scientific and technological exchanges among European teams.
Science at deep-underground laboratories. This activity aims at achieving a high level of integration of facilities for deep underground fundamental science (e.g. dark matter and neutrino studies) and other interdisciplinary applications by simultaneously establishing common access procedures, promoting the common planning of experiments, and by coordinating technological efforts in order to optimise use and access to resources and to avoid duplication.
Integrating gravitational wave research. This activity aims at integrating the communities of researchers studying gravitational waves and their astrophysical sources: both laser and atom interferometers with their extreme technological requirements; observations of graviational-wave sources through electromagnetic waves and high-energy particles; numerical/theoretical studies of such sources. It should address also the computing and data handling needs of these communities.

Social Sciences and Humanities - Starting Communities Generations and gender: a cross-national longitudinal data infrastructure for research on social cohesion and social inclusion and for the study of inter-generational relations in an ageing society. This activity aims at coordinating and integrating national research infrastructures built on longitudinal survey data by implementing common collection procedures and standards, harmonising micro- and macro-level information, and stimulating optimal use of these sources by researchers in demography, sociology, economics and other social sciences.
Research infrastructures for studying the role of intangible investment for economic growth and for the study of cultural,  historical and institutional  innovation processes. This activity aims at bringing together research infrastructures in order to sustain and further develop the empirical analytical framework that includes intangible capital in sources-of-economic-growth analysis. It also aims at bringing together research infrastructures for the study of cultural, historical, and institutional innovation processes.
Social Sciences and Humanities - Advanced CommunitiesContemporary European history: European Holocaust research infrastructure. This activity aims at building upon existing research infrastructures and expanding them to include new material and new techniques in order to open distributed access of researchers to scattered material.
European research infrastructures for restoration and conservation of cultural heritage. This activity aims at bringing together facilities, located  in research centres, universities and important culture institutions of different countries, for advanced diagnostics as well as the restoration and conservation of cultural heritage overcoming fragmentation, rationalising resources and advancing the international role of European cultural heritage research.
Expected impact: Integrating Activities are the main instrument to realise the Innovation Union flagship initiative's Commitment n. 4: ""Opening of Member State operated research infrastructures to the full European user community"", with a structuring impact on the ERA and on the way research infrastructures operate, evolve and interact with similar facilities and with their users. In particular:• Researchers will have wider, simplified, and more efficient access to the best research infrastructures they require to conduct their research, irrespective of location. They benefit from an increased focus on user needs.• A new generation of researchers is educated that is ready to exploit in the best way all the essential tools needed for their research.• Operators of related infrastructures develop synergies and complementary capabilities, leading to improved and harmonised services.

","29 March 2017","Specific Challenge:
European researchers need effective and convenient access to the best research infrastructures in order to conduct research for the advancement of knowledge and technology. The aim of this action is to bring together, integrate on European scale, and open up key national and regional research infrastructures to all European researchers, from both academia and industry, ensuring their optimal use and joint development.
Scope:
A 'Starting Community' has never been supported for the integration of its infrastructures under FP7 or Horizon 2020 calls, in particular within an integrating activity.
An Integrating Activity will mobilise a comprehensive consortium of several key research infrastructures[1] in a given field as well as other stakeholders (e.g. public authorities, technological partners, research institutions) from different Member States, Associated Countries and other third countries[2] when appropriate, in particular when they offer complementary or more advanced services than those available in Europe.
Funding will be provided to support, in particular, the trans-national and virtual access provided to European researchers (and to researchers from Third Countries under certain conditions), the cooperation between research infrastructures, scientific communities, industries and other stakeholders, the improvement of the services the infrastructures provide, the harmonisation, optimisation and improvement of access procedures and interfaces.
To this extent, an Integrating Activity shall combine, in a closely co-ordinated manner:
(i) Networking activities, to foster a culture of co-operation between research infrastructures, scientific communities, industries and other stakeholders as appropriate, and to help develop a more efficient and attractive European Research Area;
(ii) Trans-national access or virtual access activities, to support scientific communities in their access to the identified key research infrastructures;
(iii) Joint research activities, to improve, in quality and/or quantity, the integrated services provided at European level by the infrastructures.
All three categories of activities are mandatory as synergistic effects are expected from these different components.
Access should be provided only to key research infrastructures of European interest, i.e., those infrastructures able to attract significant numbers of users from countries other than the country where they are located. Other national and regional infrastructures in Europe can be involved in the project, in particular in the networking activities for the exchange of best practises, without necessarily be beneficiaries of the action.
The research infrastructures of a 'Starting Community' usually show a limited degree of coordination and networking at present. The strongest impact of an integrating activity is expected typically to arise from a focus on networking, standardisation and establishing a common access procedure for trans-national and/or virtual access provision.
In line with the strategy for EU international cooperation in research and innovation (COM(2012)497), Integrating Activities should, whenever appropriate, give due attention to any related initiatives internationally (i.e. outside the EU) and foster the use and deployment of global standards.
Integrating Activities should also organise the efficient curation, preservation and provision of access to the data collected or produced under the project, defining a data management plan, even when they opt out of the Pilot on Open Research Data. Data management, interoperability (definition of metadata and ontologies) as well as advanced data and computing services should be addressed where relevant. To this extent, proposals should build upon the state of the art in ICT and e-infrastructures for data, computing and networking, working in cooperation with e-infrastructure service providers.
Integrating Activities in particular should contribute to fostering the potential for innovation, including social innovation, of research infrastructures by reinforcing the partnership with industry, through e.g. transfer of knowledge and other dissemination activities, knowledge sharing through co-creation, activities to promote the use of research infrastructures by industrial researchers, involvement of industrial associations in consortia or in advisory bodies.
Integrating Activities are expected to duly take into account all relevant ESFRI and other world-class research infrastructures to exploit synergies, to reflect on sustainability and to ensure that rationally designed, comprehensive and coherent overall concepts for European Infrastructures are being pursued.
As the scope of an Integrating Activity is to ensure coordination and integration between all the key European infrastructures in a given field and to avoid duplication of effort, at most one proposal per area is expected to be submitted.
Further conditions and requirements that applicants should fulfil when drafting a proposal are given in part C of the section “Specific features for Research Infrastructures”. Compliance with these provisions will be taken into account during evaluation.
Integrating activities for starting communities range across all areas of science and technology. Proposals should not restrict their services to too narrow research fields and should address the wider scientific communities, even multidisciplinary ones, which can be served by the involved sets of research infrastructures.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of up to EUR 5 million would allow this topic to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
Researchers will have wider, simplified, and more efficient access to the best research infrastructures they require to conduct their research, irrespective of location. They benefit from an increased focus on user needs.
Operators of related infrastructures develop synergies and complementary capabilities, leading to improved and harmonised services. There is less duplication of services, leading to an improved use of resources across Europe. Economies of scale and saving of resources are also realised due to common development and the optimisation of operations.
Innovation is fostered through a reinforced partnership of research organisations with industry.
A new generation of researchers is educated that is ready to optimally exploit all the essential tools for their research.
Closer interactions between larger number of researchers active in and around a number of infrastructures facilitate cross-disciplinary fertilisations and a wider sharing of information, knowledge and technologies across fields and between academia and industry.
The integration of major scientific equipment or sets of instruments and of knowledge-based resources (collections, archives, structured scientific information, data infrastructures, etc.) leads to a better management of the continuous flow of data collected or produced by these facilities and resources.
When applicable, the integrated and harmonised access to resources at European level can facilitate the use beyond research and contribute to evidence-based policy making.
When applicable, the socio-economic impact of past investments in research infrastructures from the European Structural and Investment Funds is enhanced.

","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
European researchers need effective and convenient access to the best research infrastructures in order to conduct research for the advancement of knowledge and technology. The aim of this action is to bring together, integrate on European scale, and open up key national and regional research infrastructures to all European researchers, from both academia and industry, ensuring their optimal use and joint development.
Scope:
'Advanced Communities' are scientific communities whose research infrastructures show an advanced degree of coordination and networking at present, attained, in particular, through Integrating Activities awarded under FP7 or previous Horizon 2020 calls.
An Integrating Activity will mobilise a comprehensive consortium of several key research infrastructures in a given field as well as other stakeholders (e.g. public authorities, technological partners, research institutions) from different Member States, Associated Countries and other third countries[1] when appropriate, in particular when they offer complementary or more advanced services than those available in Europe.
Funding will be provided to support, in particular, the trans-national and virtual access provided to European researchers (and to researchers from Third Countries under certain conditions[2]), the cooperation between research infrastructures, scientific communities, industry and other stakeholders, the improvement of the services the infrastructures provide, the harmonisation, optimisation and improvement of access procedures and interfaces. Proposals should adopt the guidelines and principles of the European Charter for Access to Research Infrastructures.
To this extent, an Integrating Activity shall combine, in a closely co-ordinated manner:
(i) Networking activities, to foster a culture of co-operation between research infrastructures, scientific communities, industries and other stakeholders as appropriate, and to help develop a more efficient and attractive European Research Area;
(ii) Trans-national access or virtual access activities, to support scientific communities in their access to the identified key research infrastructures;
(iii) Joint research activities, to improve, in quality and/or quantity, the integrated services provided at European level by the infrastructures.
All three categories of activities are mandatory as synergistic effects are expected from these different components.
Access should be provided only to key research infrastructures of European interest, i.e., those infrastructures able to attract significant numbers of users from countries other than the country where they are located. Other national and regional infrastructures in Europe can be involved, in particular in the networking activities, for the exchange of best practices, without necessarily being beneficiaries in the proposal.
Proposals from advanced communities will have to clearly demonstrate the added value and the progress beyond current achievements in terms of integration and services, of a new grant. The strongest impact for advanced communities is expected typically to arise from focusing on innovation aspects and widening trans-national and virtual access provision, both in terms of wider and more advanced offer of scientific services, than in terms of number of users and domains served. Furthermore, in particular for communities supported in the past under three or more integrating activities, the creation of strategic roadmaps for future research infrastructure developments as well as the long-term sustainability of the integrated research infrastructure services provided at European level, need to be properly addressed. The latter requires the preparation of a sustainability plan beyond the grant lifecycle as well as, where appropriate, the involvement of funders.
In line with the strategy for EU international cooperation in research and innovation (COM(2012)497), Integrating Activities should, whenever appropriate, pay due attention to any related international initiative (i.e. outside the EU) and foster the use and deployment of global standards.
Integrating Activities should also organise the efficient curation, preservation and provision of access to the data collected or produced under the project, defining a data management plan, even when they opt out of the extended Pilot on Open Research Data. Data management (including ethics and privacy issues), interoperability, as well as advanced data and computing services should be addressed where relevant. To this extent, proposals should build upon the state of the art in ICT and e-infrastructures for data, computing and networking, and ensure connection to the European Open Science Cloud.
Integrating Activities should in particular contribute to fostering the potential for innovation, including social innovation, of research infrastructures by reinforcing the partnership with industry, through e.g. transfer of knowledge and other dissemination activities, activities to promote the use of research infrastructures by industrial researchers, involvement of industrial associations in consortia or in advisory bodies.
Integrating Activities are expected to duly take into account all relevant ESFRI and other world-class research infrastructures to exploit synergies, to reflect on sustainability and to ensure complementarity and coherence with the existing European Infrastructures landscape.
Proposals should include clear indicators allowing the assessment of the progress towards the general and specific objectives, other than the access provision.
As the scope of an integrating activity is to ensure coordination and integration between all the key European infrastructures in a given field and to avoid duplication of effort, advanced communities are expected to submit one proposal per area.
Further conditions and requirements that applicants should fulfil when drafting a proposal are given in part D of the section “Specific features for Research Infrastructures”. Compliance with these provisions will be taken into account during evaluation.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of up to EUR 10 million would allow this topic to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
On the basis of a multiannual plan drafted taking into account the assessment and the timing of previous grants as well as strategic priorities and needs, in term of research infrastructures services, emerging from other parts of Horizon 2020, this work programme invites proposals addressing the following areas listed under the different domains.

Deadline date","Scope:
Specific challenge: The notion of and access to global justice have been at the centre of many debates about the objectives and legitimacy of global governance and international law. For some, global justice implies solidarity with all humankind on the basis of inter-culturally shared values. Others think that such a broad conception of justice is untenable, and that high levels of justice may, if at all, only be attained at the level of the nation-state. While the debate is open on what a just global order can be and which values it could or should comprise, one can identify certain conditions that global political action would need to fulfil to move closer to the ideal type of such an order. Parting from a European view of global justice and human rights, European policy-makers regularly portray the European Union as an ethical global player promoting values like democracy and human rights in its external relations. Moreover, the EU's engagement in the fight for sustainability and against poverty and conflicts in the world may be an indicator of a determination to spreading its values so as to render the world more just. However, the Union's real impact on global justice, also at the institutional level, remains not only underspecified but is often also contested.
Scope: Research should first look into the criteria for global justice and contrast various understandings of it, exploring European as well as non-European and non-Western perspectives. It should then examine whether and how various criteria for a just and value-based global order are met by the EU and EU Member and Associated countries' policies, activities and regulations in issue areas that may be of particular importance for the promotion of inter-culturally shared values and justice at a global scale, such as trade and development policy, the defence of human rights, the promotion of gender equality, religious freedom conflict prevention and resolution and the protection of livelihoods. It should also investigate the impact of governmental, non-governmental and transnational actors who contest the EU's activities and present alternative visions of global justice and how to obtain it. Research should ultimately come to statements about if and how Europe does - or does not - contribute to a value-based global order. It should identify facilitating and inhibiting conditions for European action that effectively promotes its values.
The participation of international partners in proposals submitted to this call is strongly encouraged.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 1.5 and 2.5 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected impact: Research on the European contribution to a just global order, especially through institutions and law, will advance the understanding of the Union as a value-based actor in global affairs, while uncovering the conflicts that exercising this function creates with other major global players. It is thus expected that this research will shed empirical light on the potential for and limits to the EU's future place in a multi-polar global order. By identifying facilitating and restraining factors for effective EU external activities aimed at the export of values, research will provide the bases for future-oriented and evidence-based reflections on the contents and conduct of these external activities.

Specific challenge: Development policy represents one of the key areas of activity of EU external relations. In order to further enhance the impact of its actions in this policy domain, the European Union, in particular the European Consensus on Development, has, since the mid-2000s repeatedly emphasized the need for greater ""policy coherence for development"" (PCD). By referring to this concept, strengthened by Article 208 of the Lisbon Treaty, theUnion recognizes that non-development policies can have significant effects on third countries, contributing to or undermining its development policy objectives. To minimize contradictions and build synergies between development and non-development policies, the EU increasingly strives to take greater account of developing country needs and interests in the five global challenge areas of the PCD work programme: trade and finance, climate change, global food security, migration and security, as addressed in the 2011 and 2013 Policy Coherence Reports[1]. In cooperation with the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the EU has also been among the key promoters of PCD on a global scale. The idea that greater policy coherence is needed to advance global development policy objectives is also expected to play a key role in the debate on a future post-2015 development agenda. This was underlined by the Council Conclusions of May 2012 that encouraged the Commission to develop a more evidence-based approach to further improve monitoring, implementation and follow-up.[2]
Scope: Research should adopt a comprehensive perspective on EU policies and regulations and their impact on developing countries, analysing the intended and unintended consequences of both development and of non-development policies' impact on developing countries. It should, on the one hand, look into EU and EU member state development policy in various regions of the world, investigating where appropriate, to what extent and why these have proven to be effective or not. On the other hand, EU and EU member state non-development policies with a bearing for development in third countries should be closely scrutinized. Finally, the influence and policies of more recent development actors should be analysed in order to situate the European position into a global context. In this context the increasing South-South cooperation in development policies should be taken into account. Based on these analyses, a methodology should be developed for measuring progress on policy coherence for development including elaborating suitable baselines, target and indicators. Case studies on EU policies vis-à-vis developing countries from different world regions, with specific emphasis on Least Developed Countries, are needed and where appropriate meaningful comparisons are encouraged. Factors (e.g. actors/institutions, procedures, structures) that enable or hinder coherence for EU development policy should be identified at both the EU and developing country levels. Research should take into due account the cooperation on science and innovation for development pursued under the FP7 International Cooperation programme.
The participation of international partners in proposals submitted to this call is strongly encouraged.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 1.5 and 2.5 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected impact: Research on policy coherence for development in the European Union is expected to significantly advance the understanding of the bases for effective EU development policy and of the successful integration of developmental concerns into other EU policy areas. The development of a methodology for measuring costs and benefits of such coherence will, moreover, allow for identifying baselines, indicators and/or assessment criteria and targets for a continuous monitoring of PCD progress in EU policies in the medium and long term. Research will also lead to policy relevant insights, most importantly the identification of policy options on how the EU can enhance the effectiveness of its combined development and non-development policies so as to ensure greater impacts. Findings for the EU could be extrapolated to other development actors, such as the OECD, and could thus feed a global debate on the notion of policy coherence for development.

","single-stage
Deadline date","Scope:
Specific challenge: In recent years, the European Union or its members have, on several occasions, intervened in third countries to give support for conflict resolution or to counter destabilisation or other security threats. In general terms, such interventions can happen in different ways, such as military operations, intelligence cooperation, military training or humanitarian logistical support.
In the European Union, the Treaty of Lisbon foresees different response mechanisms, which can be targeted to the specific crisis it intends to tackle. They include joint disarmament operations, humanitarian and rescue tasks, military advice and assistance tasks, conflict prevention and peace-keeping tasks, tasks of combat forces in crisis management, including peace-making and post-conflict stabilisation. Such operations, however, have an impact both on the perception of the EU in third countries as well as on the international political and economic relations.
Scope: Research should analyse the crisis response mechanisms in the EU and the policies accompanying their use and investigate the Union's capacity to take decisions and to respond efficiently with a common voice, if needed. This should focus on the EU's joint military and civilian capabilities, evaluate progress made in this field as well as identify future needs in view of further strengthening EU capacities. In particular, the motivations and actor constellations behind such interventions need to be assessed as well as the consequences and limits of such actions.
The role and the influence of other international organisations such as NATO and the UN Security Council need to be analysed in the context of the interactions and synergies between these organisations and the EU. An analysis of the position of the BRICS on intervention could also help to contextualize the position of the EU as a global actor in crisis scenarios. Finally, research could investigate the situation in third countries after the EU or its members have withdrawn their military forces or other forms of support (e.g. in Iraq, Afghanistan).
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 1.5 and 2.5 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected impact: Research is expected to advance theoretical and practical knowledge on EU’s response mechanisms and their effectiveness and thus to contribute to strengthening its military and civilian capacities for anticipating crisis situations, as well as defining and promoting EU positions in terms of instruments of analysis, diplomacy and response mechanisms. By analysing and comparing the role of the EU and other international organisations in crisis situations, it will contribute to a better understanding of the EU’s role as global actor and its implications.

Specific Challenge: The specific challenge of this activity is to stimulate and support the establishment of a 'Social Innovation Community' of researchers, social innovators, end users (citizens) and policy-makers. Since the launch of the Innovation Union Flagship initiative in 2010, many actions have developed in the area of social innovation involving research and “hands on” innovation[1]. However many related actions in the field may appear disconnected and not fully exploit the possibilities offered by more effective communication and dissemination means. This could limit the policy uptake of research results. What is needed is to better link research to practice, develop joint methods and concepts in the area of social innovation research and provide a common space for gathering evidence and identifying new areas for social innovation take up in various fields.
Scope:  The scope is that of creating a Community, involving social innovators, researchers, citizens, policy makers, which will bring together on the one hand research actions and results and on the other implementation actions, new initiatives, and policy developments. It will systematically provide evidence and create greater synergies between EU-funded social innovation activities and related EU policies. It will help promote social innovation initiatives throughout Europe, increase relevance of policies and actions, and contribute to the development of a common understanding of the necessary framework conditions and related socio-economic implications of social innovation policies, activities and initiatives in Europe and beyond.
 Within the scope of the action are evidence and methodologies that contribute to social innovation up-scaling. This does not concern only European but also international developments. Such a social innovation community could be seen also as a “network of networks”. In particular the Community will take account of existing networks and platforms in the field, and build upon and expand existing coordination actions with active communities of practices and related stakeholders.
Activities should include:
− the organisation of brokerage events to enhance the networking of on-going research and experimentation projects and other activities in the area of social innovation to enhance, inter alia, a cross-project understanding of the concept of social innovation;
− information and awareness activities through the gathering of researchers and various stakeholders, including civil society organisations, citizens' groups, private actors, policy-makers, user groups and other networks;
− design strategies/activities for ensuring the best possible use of the research results and setting up of a mix of dissemination tools targeting different stakeholders at EU, national and local level;
− the organisation of events aimed at identifying priorities for collaboration and research gaps and needs, and enhancing the quality, quantity and visibility of future actions in the area of social innovation;
− supporting grassroots experiments, replication, incubation and policy uptake of research results ('up-scaling');
− setting up of a network of 'Local Facilitators' for a better dissemination and uptake at all levels.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of EUR 3 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected impact: The 'Social Innovation Community' will enable convergence towards a common understanding of social innovation as a tool and outcome. It will help to provide more effective measures and a better use of resources. The Community will facilitate the policy uptake of research results and experimentation activities. Evidence-based policy-making will be strengthened by supporting learning processes of 'what works'/'what does not work' and under what conditions. This will contribute to more social innovation initiatives from the ground, new possibilities for up-scaling of small social innovation experiments, and new tools of policy making in the field, thereby accelerating social innovation for growth.

Specific challenge:
The aim of this challenge is engage a large number of stakeholders on a dialogue and awareness process over the role, benefits, and issues of concerns on ICT for learning and inclusion.
ICT is crucial to boost the modernization of education and training. The challenge is to reinvent the education ecosystem and re-empower teachers in the digital age. Partnerships and collaboration between public and private stakeholders - including innovative entrepreneurs - more open and innovative practices for richer and more engaging and motivating learning and teaching experiences will be key to facilitate the transformation of the education and training to embrace and fit the challenges of 21st century and to ensure our young people are equipped with the skills for employment.
More than 100 million European citizens are at the risk of digital exclusion - the elderly, unemployed and low educated, migrants, people in need of care, people living in remote or poorer areas, persons with disabilities, homeless.
This challenge contributes to the debate over these issues and opportunities by facilitating an open dialogue on how technological changes and scientific progress impact and accelerate developments, including social change, determine policy changes, and support new investments, involving diverse actors with different stakes and agendas.
Scope: Develop and maintain a sustainable platform engaging a large number of key actors, stakeholders and communities of practices on how to improve co-creation and delivery of digital tools, solutions and services for the modernization of education and training and for the employability of young people, as well as for tackling the risk of digital exclusion, and thereby socio-economic exclusion.
The platform should engage - and be open to all - practitioners and stakeholders wishing to contribute to decision making processes, agree on objectives and priorities, share experiences, policies and practices on the role ICT for better education and training, e-Inclusion and e-Accessibility.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of EUR 1 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected impact: The action will generate awareness and impact on a wider participation in decision making processes related to the uptake of technologies involved in education, training and inclusion.

Deadline date","Scope:
Specific challenge: For several years, the political landscape of the South and East Mediterranean countries (SEMCs) has been evolving, affecting the geopolitical order of the whole SEMCs and Middle East area. Regimes that had been established for many decades in Tunisia, Egypt and Libya were overthrown while other political destabilisations and conflicts arose in Syria, Yemen and Lebanon. Strong tensions exist between the political establishment and forces that emerged in these processes of transformation. The SEMCs and Middle East region is often considered as one entity while each country and region has its own reality social and cultural history and values, political formations, powerful bodies – sometimes interconnected with neighbours or other regional powers in the area – influence the political situation on the internal and external scene. The political transformations that the region is facing, from war, conflict, revolution or transition, have also major impacts on the local population.
This topic aims at better understanding these different realities and how they have developed over time in order to assess the complex developments in the region. The future of the area will have significant implications both on the regional and international scenes, as well as on the relationship between Europe and the South and East Mediterranean countries. The current and future role of the EU in the Middle East will also have to be investigated.
Scope: Research should contribute to enhance knowledge on SEMCs and the Middle East area in assessing the key factors that affect the former and new leaderships and analysing the main political dynamics of the region in the broader sense of the term (including adjacent regions). It should identify the interconnections between the different countries at the geostrategic level.
Research should assess the role of internal and external actors: political bodies, religious factions, communities, elites and minorities but also the role of other players (Gulf countries, China or Russia) in the geopolitical game over time. In order to better understand interrelations of social, cultural, religious, gender and political factors and developments in the region, research should draw on a multitude of disciplinary perspectives including, for instance, sociological, historical, economic and anthropological research. Specific attention should be paid to the role of religions (Sunnis and Shias) and their influence on political factions (such as Wahhabis, Salafis, Islamic movements, Hamas, Hezbollah and Muslim Brotherhood) as well as their use of various media. Their political influence at the country, regional and international levels should be investigated. The current situation and the future of ethnical or religious minorities (Christian minorities, role of different tribes, Kurds, Druzes, Alaouites,…) in the SEMCs and Middle East should also be explored.
Research should look at the potential risk of destabilisation of the region and the effects on the population both at national and macro-regional levels (especially studying the question of refugees, migration and relocation as well as the state of women’s rights). The impact of diverse and rapidly changing migratory patterns from, to and through these countries should be analysed from a geo-political perspective, both in terms of regional cooperation as well as with regards to SEMCs relations with EU countries. Research will also identify the role of civil society and the existing cleavages or tensions that may emerge between different groups of the population (such as current and future elites but also the role of both rural and urban citizens and of gender relations) in the geopolitical and political process. Research should also build scenarios about potential developments and futures in the area over the 20 years.
Broad participation of international partners from the Mediterranean region and the Middle East in proposals submitted to this call is strongly encouraged.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 1.5 and 2.5 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected impact: Research is expected to advance knowledge on the geostrategic and geopolitical developments in the SEMCs and in the Middle East. It will focus on the existing and emerging social, cultural, political, gender and religious factors that affect the region. The topic should also contribute to better understanding of the current and future role of the EU in the region.

Specific challenge: The European Union's Eastern and North-Eastern neighbours include six post-Soviet countries of strategic importance with whom the EU has sought to reinforce relationships since the 1990s. Belarus, Moldova, Ukraine and the three countries of the South Caucasus (Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia) form together part of the EU's Eastern Partnership. The relations that the Union maintains with these countries are structured around bilateral and multilateral strategies aimed at establishing durable political, economic and cultural ties. This includes intensified research and innovation collaboration through the newly established Panel on Research and Innovation.
Major concerns for the EU's foreign policy towards this region include democracy, human rights, the rule of law and socio-economic stability. Other recurring issues pertain to good governance, migration and mobility, trade, sustainability and energy security. To date, political and socio-economic transition processes in this complex region have been rather slow. Potential reasons for this relate to internal problems and uneven developments in the six countries, but also to historical legacies, culture and the geostrategic context in which the Partnership evolves. All these factors need to be understood and accounted for if the European Union wants to design policies that durably support transition processes in this region.
Scope: Research should include stock-taking of existing bilateral relations between the EU and all countries in the region as well as between these countries inter se. It should explicitly adopt the perspective of the examined countries so as to promote the understanding within the EU of the region and its challenges. Emphasis should be put on the adaptation of economies and societies of the Eastern Partnership countries to European standards. This is closely linked to the need for determining conditions necessary for the successful implementation of association agreements. Research should also examine societal development such as the evolving activities of civil society in these countries. Given the recent focus on the Caucasus in Call SSH 2013.4.1-1 (""Security and democracy in the neighbourhood: the case of the Caucasus""), and based on the findings of the research financed under this Call, specific attention should be paid to Belarus, Moldova and Ukraine. Key issues forming part of the partnerships and recurring problems in bilateral relations should be addressed, comparing individual EU Member States' and Associated Countries' approaches and the EU's policies.
As part of this exercise, research should also examine if and how scientific cooperation and the mobility of researchers can contribute to an increased understanding between the EU actors and the countries and people of the region and to addressing societal challenges of shared concern. The geostrategic environment in which the Eastern Partnership evolves - including especially the role of Russia, but also of Turkey - should be taken into account. Contrasting European approaches toward the region with those of third countries (especially USA and China) could equally be of interest. Based on the research findings, EU policy options vis-à-vis Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Georgia, Moldova and Ukraine per se as well as to the region and its broader geostrategic environment in general should be assessed.
Broad participation of international partners from the EU's Eastern Partnership countries in proposals submitted to this call is strongly encouraged.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 1.5 and 2.5 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected impact: Research on the EU's relations with key countries in the studied region will provide sound insights into the major problems facing this region as well as into the key advances and remaining challenges in the political, economic and cultural relationships between the EU and these countries. It will thus not only contribute to a better understanding of the EU's partners, but also reveal major challenges to the European Union's neighbourhood strategy and policies. This will allow for identifying significant policy implications for the EU's approach to each of the countries individually and to the region on the whole.

Deadline date","Scope:
Specific challenge: Since the outset of the European integration process in the aftermath of World War II, Turkey has been an important economic and political partner for the EU and a strategic military ally within NATO, forming a bridge into the Middle East and the Caucasus. Turkey is also a member of the G-20 group and ranks among the top 20 countries in the world regarding the size of the country, its population and the nominal GDP. The process of Turkey's integration with the EU has started in 1963 when it became an associate member following the Ankara Agreement. Turkey applied for EU membership already in 1987, but was officially recognised as a candidate country in 1999 and the official accession negotiations started in 2005. In 1995 a customs union agreement with the EU was signed.
Following the decades of close cooperation, Turkey is already well integrated with the European Union in particular in the socio-economic themes, including cooperation on research and innovation, and in cultural matters. In recent years however, due to the economic and financial crisis as well as continuing tensions in the Middle East and the South and East Mediterranean region, the challenges facing both Turkey and the EU have grown. In this context, the different options for further EU-Turkey cooperation in the next decade should be fully explored, taking into account the rising global importance of Turkey as an independent regional power.
Scope: Research should analyse the economic, social, political and geostrategic challenges and opportunities - for Turkey itself and for the EU - of further integration of Turkey with the EU, taking into account the different forms this collaboration could take as well as its historical, socio-economic and cultural dimensions. Different scenarios and their consequences should be analysed, from the point of view of the strategic interests of both the EU and Turkey. This should include both internal and external dimensions, public debates on EU-Turkey integration as well as the analysis of impacts on relations with other global powers and with other world regions, in particular the Middle East, the South and East Mediterranean, and the Caucasus. Research should also explore the potential consequences of a lack of progress in building stronger ties between Turkey and the EU. It should engage civil society and citizens.
Broad participation of partners from Turkey and its wider neighbourhood countries in proposals submitted to this call is strongly encouraged.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 1.5 and 2.5 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected impact: Research is expected to advance theoretical and practical debates on the different scenarios, and their implications, of the potential further integration of Turkey with the EU and to provide the analysis of the challenges and opportunities associated with this process. It will make a critical assessment of the evolution of EU relations with Turkey in the last decades as well as how they were affected by the shifting global order and the rise of Turkey as a regional power. These activities will contribute to a better understanding of the challenges facing the EU neighbourhood and enlargement policies as well as will provide evidence base to support them.

Specific challenge: During the last decade, the Mediterranean basin has inspired several concepts, instruments and policies like the Barcelona process, the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership, the Union for the Mediterranean, the European Neighbourhood Policy, action plans and association agreements. The boundaries of the Mediterranean area are not clearly delimited. This region could only include the Mediterranean basin countries (with direct access to the Mediterranean), whereas other specialists take into account the influence of other partners, for example the Gulf States. It is also a dynamic region with the outward and inward movement of people and associated religious, linguistic and ethnic diversity.
For several decades, bilateral approaches to cooperation between the Northern and Southern shores of the Mediterranean have been favoured and this is still prevailing. In this context, an important question arises on the effectiveness of bilateralism versus regionalism taking into account the role of the European Neighbourhood Policy in this region as well as how such policies are perceived by the South. Furthermore, following recent developments in the region, it is important to identify and characterise new leaderships in the Mediterranean area taking into account pluralism of and the power shifts among strategic players as well as the role and significance of other countries that are not part the Mediterranean area.
Scope: Research should assess the potential and effectiveness of the policies and measures implemented between the two shores of the Mediterranean and identify the obstacles and prospects for further collaboration. In this context, the concept of bilateralism and regionalism should be defined and assessed in the Mediterranean area, including the pros and cons of both concepts as well as the evaluation of the potential of in-depth cooperation in specific fields like science and technology, water, agriculture, energy, cultural heritage or transport.
Research should discuss also from a historical perspective, the different understandings of this region and explore which countries significantly influence the situation and developments in the region. In this context, the citizens' perceptions of the image, role and influence of Mediterranean collaboration need to be investigated from both Northern and Southern shores. To this end, data on citizens’ perceptions of the Mediterranean will be collected and updated.
Research should also identify the best practices, priorities and potential future developments that could improve the relations in this region, taking into account potential new strategies and political priorities that could emerge in the near future.
Broad participation of international partners from the Mediterranean region in proposals submitted to this call is strongly encouraged.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 1.5 and 2.5 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected impact: The assessment of the prospects for and obstacles to further collaboration between the two shores of the Mediterranean will improve the understanding of the European Union's external action in the area and should contribute to a reflection on its future role in the region. Research will particularly lead to a refined conceptualization of the new geopolitical configuration of the Mediterranean area which will contribute to debates on the most appropriate mix of policies and measures either through a regional or a bilateral approach, including at sectorial level. Finally, activities under this topic will lead to identifying possible actions needed to improve the EU-Mediterranean collaboration dealing with the particular features of each country in this area.

","26 June 2014","Scope:
Specific challenge: At present, oils crops are already an important source of innovative bio-based products such as bioplastics, lubricants, paints or added value fine chemicals. With the opening of new markets for these products the demand for oil crops is increasing. The challenge for Europe here is to sustainably match this demand without increasing our dependency on external biomass or competing with food production or increasing environmental pressure (particularly on soil and land). The development of dedicated and optimised multipurpose oil crops, the full use of the biomass in a cascade approach as well as the environmentally sound and sustainable use of natural resources should be key to meet this challenge.
Scope:Proposals should focus on development of dedicated and optimised oil crops adapted to industrial needs. Research should encompass gene discovery and optimisation through to full use of biomass oil including vegetative tissues and ensure efficient exploitation of the residual biomass through modern breeding technologies. It should consider the environmental aspects (e.g. organic matter levels, biodiversity impact and water needs) of such full use of biomass. It should also ensure development of oil production with sufficient quantity, quality and homogeneity. The concepts should take into account the cascading approach and focus on added value products. A strong participation of SMEs should contribute to the realisation of the expected outcomes. Proposals should include demonstration activities to assess the techno-economic viability of the proposed concepts. The Technology Readiness Levels covered by the projects should range from 4 to 6; please see part G of the general Annexes. The overall economic, social and environmental sustainability issues as well as its Life Cycle Assessment should also be critical elements.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU in the range of EUR 10 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected impact:
         Broadening the range of suitable oil feedstock candidates with optimally-lowered resource inputs and developing economically viable and sustainable, eco-friendly end bio-based products
         Measurable improvement of critical aspects along the value chain from the cultivation issues, to optimisation of desired biochemical parameters and extraction of oils and other biomolecules, to improved valorisation of the raw materials, to allow development of industrial end products.
         Contribution to European policy initiatives, including the EU Bioeconomy strategy and the EU Innovation Policy as well as to other related policies such as Lead Market Initiative on bio-based products.

With the expected increase in global population, demand for animal food products and competition for natural resources, agriculture and forestrywill need to become more efficient, and sustainable.
Scope: Proposals should address the following issues (E):
E. [2015] Sustainable livestock production
Sustainable livestock production, including animal health and welfare, but also in areas like breeding, nutrition and production systems.
The main objective of these ERA-NETs is to pool the necessary financial resources from the participating national (or regional) research programmes and the EU and to implement joint trans-national calls with EU co-funding in the above areas (one co-funded call per grant agreement, resulting in grants to third parties). Thematic focusing of these calls should be commensurate with the funds available, so as to ensure a reasonable rate of success in the call. The ERA-NETs should seek synergies with other relevant European and international research and innovation initiatives affecting sustainability and resilience of agriculture and food systems, in particular the FACCE and HDHL Joint Programming Initiatives. In line with the objectives of the EU strategy for international cooperation in research and innovation, proposals are encouraged to consider international cooperation, and the ERA-NETs should be open to participation by third countries national programmes[1].
The proposals should also aim at implementing other joint activities including additional joint calls without EU co-funding.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU in the range of EUR 5 million for (E) would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected impact:

Specific challenge: The bioeconomy encompasses the production of renewable biological resources and the conversion of these resources and waste streams into value added products, such as food, feed, bio-based products and bioenergy[1]. It cuts across many different sectors and research and innovation fields, and has a wide range of socio-economic implications. Addressing comprehensively inter-connected societal challenges related to the bioeconomy requires: 1. Ensuring a responsible and participative governance, by overcoming the current lack of information and public debate on the bioeconomy, while responding to citizens' needs and concerns,  by providing adequate support to new promising markets, and by reconciling conflicting policies and ethical concerns; and  2. Integrating efforts undertaken throughout all steps of the research and innovation chain, to facilitate the flow from discovery to market applications and to speed up the innovation process.
Scope:Proposals should address the following issue (A):
A.    Engaging society, reaching end users and linking with policy makers for a participative governance of the bioeconomy[2]
Proposals should foresee high impact information, awareness raising, educational and debate activities on the bioeconomy. They should address the creation of national or regional multi-stakeholder bioeconomy platforms, for informed debates involving policy makers, the various stakeholders (scientists, business, non-governmental organisations, etc.) and citizens, building on existing tools (such as the Bioeconomy Observatory) and scientific studies (such as foresight). These platforms should also facilitate the development of balanced and informed national and regional bioeconomy strategies.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU in the range of EUR 1–2 million for (A) would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected impact: Proposals should show how some, or all, of the following impacts will be achieved:
         Engage the public to develop an understanding of the bioeconomy and its consequences and benefits.
         Improve the availability and quality of information on bioeconomy products and processes, including their social, economic and environmental impacts and the related ethical concerns, and foster future-oriented multi-stakeholders dialogues
         Facilitate the development and acceptability of regional and national bioeconomy strategies
         Speed up the pace of innovation, by bridging the gap between discovery and market, through closer ties between activities throughout the research and innovation chain
         Contribute to increasing the number of innovative products and processes reaching the market, and increasing the number of new companies and new jobs created from EU-funded research and innovation projects. Impacts could also be important on standards and policy development.

","07 November 2017
","04 September 2018","Specific Challenge:
Climate change is likely to make it harder to address inter alia poverty, disease, food and water insecurity in Europe. Rising temperatures and changing precipitation will affect the availability of food, energy and water, leading to likely increased volatility in food prices, and heightened regional tensions, affecting international stability and security. An increased frequency and/or intensity of extreme weather events may adversely affect human, animal and plant health, disrupt the flow of natural resources and commodities, and threaten infrastructure globally. Moreover, the inherent uncertainty of climate impacts is likely to increase risks for the business and financial sectors.
Scope:
Actions should address only one of the following sub-topics:
a) Climate change impacts on health in Europe: Actions should review, report and progress on the current state-of-the art knowledge on the links between climate change and impacts on human health in Europe that have thus far been poorly addressed or understood. Actions should also identify associated costs and suggest effective adaptation strategies, quantify health co-benefits from mitigation and early adaptation, target research actions to address key issues and identified research gaps[1] and prioritise those that are of significance for Europe. Actions may, where appropriate, cluster with activities of global collaborative research actions (e.g. Belmont Forum) on climate change and health. Applicants are encouraged to seek synergies with relevant actions under Societal Challenge 1.
b) Global climate change impacts from a European perspective: Actions should consider how direct and indirect impacts beyond European borders will affect supply and value chains of relevance for the European economy and society, and related sectors such as finance, business, infrastructure, resources and commodities. Actions should also consider how these impacts will affect relevant European policies, such as those on climate change, foreign affairs, security, agriculture and/or others, and analyse how perceived associated risks may further impact on Europe. Actions should consider different climate (including high-end) scenarios and undertake a risk analysis for Europe at the most appropriate geographic and time scales.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 5 million and EUR 7 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
The project results are expected to contribute to:
improved capability in assessing impacts of climate change;
enabling evidence-based decision making through better understanding of mitigation and adaptation costs and co-benefits, and of potential new climate-related pressures on the EU;
enhanced information base relevant for the 2023 global stocktake exercise under the UNFCCC;
informing major international scientific assessments such as the IPCC reports and the IPBES, as well as to EU and national adaptation strategies and plans;
cohesive European resilience to climate change.

Under the Paris Agreement (PA), Parties of the UNFCCC have to submit and periodically update Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), which represent their undertaking to pursue the objectives the Agreement. Parties have also committed to formulate and communicate their mid-century low greenhouse gas emission development strategies by 2020. The collective progress towards achieving the objectives of the PA will be periodically assessed, with the first ‘global stocktake’ envisaged to take place in 2023. These critical processes for global climate action must be underpinned by authoritative scientific results at national, regional and global level and supported by knowledge co-created through adequate frameworks that enhance legitimacy, inclusion, effectiveness and sustainability. Science should provide the necessary tools and knowledge-base in order to support the above mentioned processes, and contribute to the high impact and quality of the major emitters’ submissions.
Scope:
Actions should address only one of the following sub-topics:
a) Supporting the design and assessment of climate policies: Actions should provide new and more comprehensive scientific knowledge on the design, requirements, governance and impacts of climate action at national, European and global level, for the effective implementation of NDCs, the preparation of future action pledges, the development of 2050 decarbonisation strategies in major emitting countries and for supporting the 2023 global stocktake under the UNFCCC. The potential and feasibility for dynamically increasing decarbonisation ambition over time should be considered, together with related socio-economic impacts and co-benefits (for example those related to water, air pollution or avoided impacts of climate change), also taking into consideration market-driven actions. This action should be based on the use of ensembles of Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs), covering the entire economy, all greenhouse gases, and the wide range of climate, air quality/environment, energy and other sectoral policies contributing to decarbonisation, and should provide useful information at global and national level. Beyond the EU, proposals should extend their analysis to some major emitters outside Europe and to selected less developed countries.
b) Improving Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs): Actions should further improve the state-of-the-art of IAMs, in order to provide robust and transparent assessments to support the design and evaluation of all mitigation policies – including those on energy efficiency and renewables – in the short to mid-term, as well as to address the challenges and opportunities related to long term decarbonisation with a time horizon beyond 2050. Improvements in one or more of the following areas should be addressed: sectoral coverage across the entire economy (including more accurate representation of bunker fuels and land-based emissions/sinks), inclusion of all greenhouse gases, representation of issues such as structural and behavioural change and uncertainty, inequality, interaction with other relevant development goals, negative emission technologies, co-benefits of actions due to avoided impacts and reduced adaptation needs. Furthermore, actions should also improve the geographical coverage of global models including through in-country development of national modelling capacity.
Under both a) and b) subtopics and in line with the strategy for EU international cooperation in research and innovation (COM(2012)497), international cooperation is encouraged with major emitters and with less developed countries requiring support for the design and implementation of current and future NDCs.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 5 million and EUR 7 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
The project results are expected to contribute to:
supporting EU climate policy and the preparation of EU submissions to the UNFCCC and the 2023 global stocktake exercise under the UNFCCC;
major international scientific assessments such as the IPCC reports;
enhanced international cooperation
fostering innovative policy-making through robust methodologies and tools and reduction of uncertainties;

The Black Sea is going through rapid changes in response to closely interlinked natural and anthropogenic pressures. Climate change is influencing the physical dynamics and hydrological structure of the Black Sea, while nutrient and pollutant loads are flowing from growing urban areas, inland and coastal activities. Increasing maritime traffic is also leading to safety concerns, water and air pollution and the introduction of invasive alien species. Fishing activities in the Black Sea are unsustainable. The area's marine heritage and its ecosystem services are also at risk. The geo-political complexity of the area further complicates the establishment of favourable framework conditions to support the growth of the blue economy (e.g. in trans-border cooperation on sea-related activities, including maritime spatial planning). Coordinated and integrated actions need to be carried out by countries bordering the Black Sea individually and together in order to create synergies and complementarities between sectors and countries. A common marine and maritime R&I strategy needs to be developed in order to achieve knowledge-based, sustainable and long- lasting Blue Growth in the region.
Scope:
Proposals shall develop a Strategic Research and Innovation Agenda and Implementation Plan and contribute to the further alignment and convergence of national research and innovation activities and other relevant initiatives and investments by and with the different actors and across different sectors in primis between the countries bordering the Black Sea coasts and the whole EU. Activities shall establish and consolidate an operational network of marine and maritime research funders and other key players. Activities shall support the design and implementation of new transnational joint activities This action shall build on past and on-going regional, international as well national and EU projects/initiatives (e.g. SEAS-Era ERA-NET, PERSEUS, COCONET, European research infrastructures such as EMBRC, Euro-Argo ERIC, ICOS ERIC and EMSO ERIC, Black Sea Economic Cooperation, DANUBIS-RI etc.). It must integrate research, policy, industry (including aquaculture) and society (including the preservation of local coastal cultures). It shall also contribute to pooling different funding streams at national and EU level, and combine them in an effective way. In agreement with the Commission services, projects should ensure appropriate flexibility so as to respond in real time to potentially fast-changing policy scenarios.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU in the range of EUR 2 million would allow this specific challenge to be adequately addressed. Nonetheless, this does not preclude the submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:

","04 September 2018","Specific Challenge:
European historic areas[1] and their surroundings, both in urban and rural environments, are increasingly affected by climate-change and various natural hazard events. Increasing their resilience through ‘preparedness’ interventions and securing their sustainable reconstruction in case of damage or destruction is essential to preserve their identity and economic, social and environmental functionality and to seamlessly transmit their historic value to new generations. However, interventions in historic areas are quite difficult and hence costly due to specific characteristics associated with heritage sites (such as artistic values, denser urban fabric, material compatibility requirements, higher vulnerability of materials and structures, difficulty in accessing the damaged areas, high symbolic values for communities involved, traditional lifestyles, etc.). Knowledge- and evidence-based approaches to resilience enhancement and reconstruction approaches are needed to increase the cost-effectiveness of these activities from the whole life cycle perspective.
Scope:
Actions should establish how to implement the principle of building back better[2] and safer in carrying out sustainable reconstruction and recovery interventions of historic areas where damage has occurred, thus rendering them more socially, economically and environmentally resilient, and/or should establish how to proactively enhance the resilience of these areas so that they will better cope with future disasters. Furthermore, actions should:
develop, deploy and validate tools, information models, strategies and plans for enhancing the resilience of historic areas to cope with disaster events, vulnerability assessment and integrated reconstruction;
test and pilot novel cost-effective solutions to enhance the resilience of buildings and whole historic areas to natural hazards, including climate change related events, while at the same time fully respecting the historic value of the places;
provide science- and evidence-based guidelines and models to local authorities for carrying out sustainable reconstruction within a participatory and community–based context, while adopting new governance and finance models;
improve and further develop models to predict direct and indirect impacts of climate, global and environmental change and related risks on historic areas;
review, map and systematically characterize existing experiences and good practices in Europe and globally, through evidence and common metrics to evaluate and establish their replicability conditions, and recommend how historic areas can be rendered more resilient and better prepared to face future disaster events.
The participation of social sciences and humanities disciplines such as gender studies, architecture, archaeology, cultural anthropology, law, economics, governance, planning, cultural and historical studies, is considered essential to properly address the complex challenges of this topic. Consortia should also include societal stakeholders and community-based partners to find practical and durable solutions.
Actions should take into account activities addressed by other initiatives such as the EU Copernicus Climate Change Service and Copernicus Emergency Management Service, and provide added value.
Actions should envisage resources for clustering with other projects relevant to cultural heritage funded under previous, current and future Horizon 2020 calls within Societal Challenge 5. Proposals should also pay attention to the special call conditions for this topic.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 5 million and EUR 6 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
The project results are expected to contribute to:
enhanced resilience and reduced vulnerability of historic areas to climate change and other natural hazards, also accounting for their synergistic impact;
improved reconstruction and economic and social recovery of historic areas by local authorities and communities through the use of new knowledge and tools.

","12 September 2019","Specific Challenge:
Urban, metropolitan and peri-urban areas are experiencing a huge increase in demand for new logistics solutions that deal with the requirements of the 'on demand economy' and incorporate opportunities for shared, connected and low-emission logistics operations. Research is needed on how to prioritize and combine a number of competing interests from the private side and public (policy) side.
Scope:
Proposals should address all of the following aspects:
Developing value cases for integrated systems of logistics/ freight operations in urban, metropolitan and peri-urban areas, such as TEN-T urban nodes and consolidation centres in urban areas.
Addressing (and planning for) the integration of low-emission, and possibly connected (automated) delivery vehicles (e.g. cargobikes, drones) in urban logistics.
In line with the Union's strategy for international cooperation in research and innovation international cooperation is encouraged.[1]
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 2 to 4 million each would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
Actions will result in a clear understanding of cost effective (non-vehicle technology based) strategies, measures and tools to achieve essentially zero emission city logistics in major European urban centres by 2030.
Actions will deliver new tested, demonstrated practices and solutions for better cooperation between suppliers, shippers and urban/regions policy makers (planners). These actions should clearly provide inputs for the preparation and implementation of sustainable urban logistics plans (SULPs) and/or SUMPs and other planning (private and public side) tools, such as big data and real-time traffic management.

","Research and Innovation action
","31 October 2017
","19 September 2018","Specific Challenge:
The air quality situation in Europe has not sufficiently improved for some pollutants and significant exceedances are still found, for example, for particles, ozone and nitrogen oxides, particularly in areas affected by specific environmental or industrial conditions.. Similar situations occur in many cities around the world, and this is the reason for designing this international cooperation flagship.
High hopes are pinned on zero tailpipe emission technologies that might solve the problem in the longer term, particularly in the road sector. However, fleet renewal is too slow to just wait for all vehicles on the road to be replaced by electrified ones in order to solve the air quality issue. Also, emissions from other sectors, such as ships and aircraft in ports, internal waterways and airports, can contribute significantly to the problem, and zero emission technologies are not often available.
It is therefore urgent to address in as many ways as possible the reduction of the impact of the existing internal combustion transport fleets and support local authorities and other regulatory bodies with the provision of appropriate/advanced tools. Monitoring of the car fleet, for instance, can detect high emitters, allowing to provide information to authorities for possible cases of defeat devices, tampering, poor durability of depollution systems.
In the case of tampering, the legal situation varies among member states and needs to be clarified in view of facilitating enforcement.
The choices of customers buying new vehicles can be oriented towards cleaner vehicles by making visible which are those that have an overall better performance (i.e. as a consumer information measure, separate from EU certified type-approval testing, while users of existing polluting vehicles could be encouraged to use them in a more environmentally friendly way.
It is also important to verify the performance of On Board Detection (OBD) systems and of periodic inspections and improve them where appropriate.
On board measurement of pollutants could enable new implementation approaches to regulation showing on the one hand how much each driver pollutes (helping in the eco-driving effort) whilst on the other hand allowing a real ""polluter pays"" approach to certification, taxation and traffic regulation (the needed technology will be explored in LC-MG-1-4-2018, together with research on hardening de-pollution systems against tampering).
Apart from road vehicles, airports and ports can strongly contribute to poor air quality, it is therefore important to quantify their impact and monitor their evolution.
Finally, the health impact of extremely fine particles and of Volatile and Semi-Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs and SVOCs free or absorbed in the particles), is still not well understood. Such ultra-fine particles have been proven to pass the alveoli, placental and brain barriers and they can reach other organs through the blood stream and generate serious health impacts which need further research.
Scope:
Given the policy relevance of the topic, the selected consortia will regularly share their findings with relevant European Commission services. Proposals will have to address one of the following subtopics and clearly indicate which subtopic they are addressing:
A) Low-emission oriented driving, management and assistance. This area aims at exploring the impact of the user (including his driving behaviour and choices in maintaining the vehicle) on emission production:
Driving behaviour exploration: PEMS[1] driving measurement campaigns to assess driver behaviour variability and correlate it with real powertrain emission, and (if needed by lab measurement and modelling) brakes and road/tires emissions;
Derivation of low polluting-emissions driving practices and dissemination through awareness campaigns. The collected data should be of adequate quality to be also usable as input for future implementation in driving assistance tools and automated driving, as well as traffic management;
Assessment of the impact of other user behaviours such as poor maintenance or tampering. All aspects and causes should be studied, including an assessment of the real effectiveness of OBD and periodic inspections, of the legal situation of tampering in each member state (for both sales of devices and installation) and of the most effective ways to induce car owners not to tamper and to properly maintain their vehicles (considering both technical and economic reasons for their behaviour);
Assessment of the potential impact of retrofits[2], both for light and heavy duty road vehicles and NRMM[3] (including the development of methodologies to verify a level of durability appropriate for the application) and promotion of their application in cities with pollution problems.
In line with the strategy for EU international cooperation in research and innovation (COM(2012)497) international cooperation is encouraged, in particular with China and other Asian and/or CELAC countries.
B) Starting from recently defined emissions indicators (RDE test results including NOx max and PN max values, WLTP CO2 emissions), development of a 12 to 18 month project to timely develop support to informed consumer choice by defining a holistic testing and scoring mechanism. This should be capable of assessing all vehicles (conventional and electrified) and lead to a single ""GREEN VEHICLE index"". Such index should encompass all of the relevant criteria, e.g. tailpipe CO2, and polluting emissions such as NOx/NO2, hydrocarbons and particles, noise, performance and operating cost. The developed methodology should be fine-tuned in a pilot phase on a sufficiently large number of vehicles to ensure that the results are comparable and provide a fair and reliable assessment. Such an index could result in a public awareness scheme (running after project end) capable of orienting eco-conscious consumer choice, and to create a virtuous circle (as achieved by EURONCAP for safety) creating competition on who brings to market the cleanest vehicles. The mechanism should complement (not overlap with) the results of regulatory real-driving emissions (RDE) tests with an aim to maximise the coverage of real-world driving situations and provide relevant information. Particular attention should be paid to the ways in which the variability of real-world emissions performance is communicated, and what usage patterns deliver the best performance (being therefore complementary to the study and awareness raising activities in Subtopic A).
C) Sensing and monitoring emission in urban road transportation system. This area intends to urgently provide a means to monitor fleet-wide on-road emissions, to detect and repress any emission-affecting modifications of individual vehicles (tampering) or bad maintenance/poor after-treatment system durability/OBD ineffectiveness, to support local air quality plans, and to help national and local enforcement authorities in identifying and prosecuting infringing vehicles.
Remote sensing of road vehicle emissions (contactless measurements from the roadside, portals or from chasing vehicles); further technological development of available techniques is needed to improve performance, reduce costs, facilitate use by unskilled personnel and achieve a broader deployment potential;
Establishment of a proper data infrastructure built around vehicle registration databases, traffic management measures and air quality monitoring systems;
Demonstration of the system in several cities;
In line with the strategy for EU international cooperation in research and innovation (COM(2012)497), international cooperation is encouraged, in particular with China.
D) Cost effective enforcement of shipping related emissions legislation, both at the EU and global level, is essential for the expected environmental improvements to be achieved. To support the enforcement, assess their effectiveness and to identify potential future gaps it is necessary to develop, evaluate and demonstrate cost effective systems to measure the airborne emissions of pollutants from a vessel under real operational conditions ( e.g using on board systems) and to target ships for inspection and the enforcement of emission limits.
For coastal, urban and port areas, develop measuring technologies and 'beyond state of the art' modelling tools to assess the contribution of air emissions from ships and their comparative impact on air quality and health building also on projects such as 'Interreg Clean North Sea Shipping (CNSS) and the LIFE project 'Clean Inland Shipping' (CLINSH).
In addition to characterising and quantifying particulate matter (in particular, the most harmful, including ultrafine), such systems should also be able to simultaneously measure other relevant pollutants including SOx and NOx.
In line with the strategy for EU international cooperation in research and innovation (COM(2012)497), international cooperation is encouraged, in particular with the involvement of the largest ports and regulating authorities and other relevant bodies within the Asian region as well as in the frame of the activities of the International Maritime Organisation to which EU Member States and global maritime nations are parties.
E) Measurement of airborne pollutants emissions from aircraft under parking (with functioning APU), taxiing, take-off and climb-out conditions and under different climate conditions (In addition to characterising and quantifying particulate matter down to at least 10nm, systems should also be able to simultaneously measure other relevant pollutants including SOx and NOx). An assessment of pollutants' transport and impact on air quality in and around airports, in a form potentially suitable for regulation should be performed.
In line with the Union’s strategy for international cooperation in research and innovation (COM(2012)497), international cooperation is encouraged, in particular with Asia, CELAC and the US.
F) In-vitro and in-vivo assessment of health effects of ultrafine nanoparticles (VOCs and SVOCs) emitted from engines of the different transport modes particularly when using fuels with high aromatic content. Focus should be on understanding the biological processes leading to acute genotoxic and systemic effects in the lungs and, in particular, beyond.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU between EUR 2 and 5 million would allow the different specific challenges to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
All the above actions contribute to the UN's Sustainable Development Goals (SDG), in particular SDG 3 (""Ensure healthy lives and promote wellbeing for all at all ages"") and 11 (“Make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable”) through:
Reduction of emissions from the existing combustion-engined car fleet (A, C);
Reduction of unnecessary driver-induced emissions though a better awareness by the public of their role in controlling polluting emissions (A) ;
Increase of low emitting vehicle sales by providing more information to guide buyers towards the cleanest available vehicles (B);
Reduction of transport-related emissions though the improvements of detection and enforcement against vehicles with tampering, defeat devices or durability issue, as well as of ships not complying with emissions regulations, i.e. not using clean low-sulphur fuels, suitable engine parameters for NOx reduction or properly activating de-pollution devices where appropriate (C, D) ;
Better understanding of the impact of the different transport modes through monitoring detection and modelling of emissions in the existing road vehicle fleet as well as ships and aircraft (C, D, E) ;
Improved and more comprehensive data for risk assessment from air pollutants from different transport modes and identification of cost effective reduction measures (F);
Provide technical evidence to assess gaps in current regulation of vehicles and air quality (All).

","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Europe's urban areas are struggling to develop themselves into well-connected multimodal and multi-usage nodes for smart and clean mobility. Multiple trends affect urban and inter-urban areas: urban growth, densification, digitalisation, increasing pressure from freight movements and a shift to a service-oriented economy. Moreover, many European cities and regions areas are committed to develop into zero-emission areas.
New technologies and innovative measures are emerging, but they are not taken up at a scale that is necessary to meet our climate targets and European transport policy objectives. In many instances, the responsible authorities (often operating at different governance levels) cooperate with public and private stakeholders. But the full integration and implementation of new solutions lags behind because little information, data and tested, innovative solutions are available on their effectiveness and on how to overcome the barriers to successful implementation into older legacy systems and ageing infrastructures.
Scope:
This topic is divided in 3 sub-topics.
Innovation Action:
The first part of this topic invites for proposals that combine new technologies and non-technological innovations, more effective forms of governance, and accompanying (policy-based) measures for all modes of transport.
The proposed projects should be carried out by local/regional authority-led consortia, covering three different urban or inter-urban areas that have a connection with the TEN-T network[1] or an equivalent size, major transport corridor, each of them facing different spatial, social and/or economic challenges and/or experiences with the organisation of large/sport events.
Each urban area should establish a living laboratory where under real life-conditions a set of innovative, complementary and reinforcing scalable mobility solutions, centered around a principal solution can be developed, tested and implemented in an integrated, multimodal approach. The participating urban areas, which may have a geographical coverage that goes as far as the full functional urban area, should demonstrate their common interests and outline how they will ensure a meaningful and close cooperation. Proposals should outline how the proposed approach meets the needs of an efficient, flexible and accessible TEN-T[2] urban node or a city located at an equivalent sized transport corridor, which in turn delivers an optimal use of the transport network and the integration of cost-effective solutions for energy supply/storage (with use of renewable energy as much as possible) and recharging networks for transport, and ICT networks for all modes of transport. The work of relevant Horizon 2020-funded projects, such as VITALNODES[3], could provide a useful starting point.
Proposals should explain how the proposed work will support the public authorities' efforts to implement their Sustainable Urban Mobility Plan, in combination with urban (land) planning and development, and infrastructure planning and operations. Attention should be paid to issues related to vulnerable groups of citizens, gender issues and health impact of mobility. Actions may include research activities, and some preparatory, take up and replication actions, as well as the development of tools to support planning and policy making. Work may also include demonstration of a resilient urban mobility system, capable to address particular challenges in the organisation of large/sport events. Proposals are encouraged to incorporate new approaches to increase the availability and integration of data to support policymaking and business activities in smart, zero and low-emission mobility and to explore innovative ways of increasing the share of active modes of transport.
To capture impacts, the activities should include monitoring, for example, aspects such as modal share, energy intensity, level of emissions, impact on health, transport network performance (demand and supply) and connectivity through interoperability and multimodality. Projects are expected to collaborate with the established impact evaluation framework (using both clear baselines and measurable impact indicators), as well the dissemination and information exchange framework put in place in the field of urban mobility by the Commission.
Additionally, proposals should seek to establish financial and institutional/organisational cooperation models to enable seamless transport across the TEN-T urban node area or equivalent.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 7 to 9 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts. Typically, projects should have duration of 48 months and foresee sufficient time for evaluation, dissemination and exploitation activities.
Coordination and Support Action: fast-track and mainstream the replication of innovative, urban, peri-urban and rural mobility solutions
The second part of this topic is a Coordination and Support Action that aims to fast-track and mainstream the replication of innovative, tested urban, peri-urban and rural mobility solutions (e.g. technological, non-technological, services, goods and infrastructure). Proposals are expected to set up and run a 'Fast-track to innovative sustainable motorised and non-motorised mobility' action (working title – proposers are invited to choose an appealing title), which offers support and services to at least 20 cities and municipalities or their organisational/functional groupings. A 'staged approach' is possible – taking into account mobility, investment or geographical needs as well as delivering the project efficiently. At least one-third of these 20 locations should be located in areas experiencing rapid economic and social change.
The proposal should include all of the following actions:
Support for the development and towards implementation of innovative mobility solutions in 4 broad areas:
Investments in and management of the transport network
Supporting modal shift towards more energy-efficient, safer and active (whenever possible) modes for transport of freight and/or passengers
New operating and business models in collective public and private transport (in any transport mode).
Supporting mobility actions within the scope of the European Innovation Partnership in Smart cities and communities (or its successor working on smart cities).
Development and implementation of a programme of tailored actions to deliver capacity building and institutional networking by:
a. Supporting staff exchanges, expert visits, and short term training.
b. Supporting the identification and access to financial and legal expertise, to define the feasibility to replicate an innovative mobility solution and to develop an innovation deployment programme of scale, notably: meetings with (potential) investors, opportunities for follow-up investments and identification of synergies with European funding and financing.
c. Providing matchmaking services for innovative mobility solutions establishing the link between ""suppliers"" that may be both public and private organisations, or groupings thereof (such as Horizon2020 funded projects) and ""customers"" that are mainly public organisations (such as city councils, regional authorities, transport operators or their groupings).
d. The project should deliver a set of recommendations to bridge the gap in the research and innovation performance and the deployment of the innovative mobility solutions across EU Member States.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of EUR 1 to 1.5 million each would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Coordination and Support Action: prepare for the deployment of Urban Air Mobility in urban and peri-urban areas
The integration of vertical urban mobility solutions (drones, and other forms of low-aerial mobility, as well as services) into existing surface multimodal transport (both freight and passenger) systems will add further complexity to the organisation of the urban and peri-urban transport and mobility services. It will require changes in public/shared transport management, logistics operations and infrastructure operations. With rapid technological progress in urban air mobility, especially local and regional public sector authorities are faced with challenges such as in financing, procuring, planning (infrastructure, systems), transport operations, safety, noise, security and public acceptance of these solutions.
The proposal should include all of the following actions:
a) To provide a knowledge base (dynamic updated, with a ""brand"") and to deliver a set of policy recommendations (in at least 8 languages – for use by local, regional, national and European public authorities, businesses and other organisations) for measures to (seamlessly) integrate the vertical and horizontal dimensions in urban and peri-urban mobility systems. These are notably:
Minimum required standards for products and processes in for ITS-type applications, urban planning (SUMPs), data-exchange, energy infrastructure, payments, environmental objectives, travel information and possibly other sectors such as building, construction, health care, retail etc.
Foresight deployment scenarios of up to 10 possible use cases in 5 to 15 years; public acceptance, governance, mobility systems, energy supply systems, infrastructure, investment opportunities, funding and financing needs, and land-use. An approach to set up these scenarios with wide consultation should be included in the proposal to ensure that social acceptance aspects are fully understood.
Tools for exchange and learning of urban air mobility with and to public authorities (notably local and regional), businesses civil society and research organisations.
b) To provide specific project development support and technical assistance for up to 10 deployment 'use cases' in locations (or groups thereof) with a demonstrated commitment from public and private organisations that are planning to start testing urban air mobility applications in the next 3 years. The type of support should as minimum include feasibility and market studies, programme and urban planning actions (for example procurement strategies).
This proposal should work closely together with the ongoing actions of the European Innovation Partnership in Smart cities (or its successor) and CIVITAS (or its successor) and possibly other networks with a strong participation of local and regional authorities.
The proposal should propose actions for cooperation with EASA, the SESAR Joint Undertaking, EUROCONTROL and the European U-Space Demonstrator network to ensure that project results are fed into developments in the institutional, regulatory and architectural frameworks for a competitive U-space services market.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of EUR 1 to 1.5 million each would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
For the Innovation Action:
Projects should act as European demonstration-type (""lighthouse"")[4] examples for integrating new scalable technologies and measures into city transport operations and existing transport infrastructures at real-life scale in order to achieve long-term decarbonisation impacts; reliable solutions for a more sustainable, inclusive, safe and secure mobility system, including for the secure mobility of people and freight during major/sport events; clear improvements of the efficiency and accessibility of the transport networks/systems covering the TEN-T urban nodes or equivalent, and their access to the relevant TEN-T corridor(s) or equivalent transport corridors for transport of freight and/or passengers. Positive long term impacts on social cohesion, economic development and public perception – resulting in behavioural change and policy change - are anticipated.
Projects will contribute to the development of the existing European knowledge base on the effectiveness and impacts resulting from the implementation of innovative mobility solutions.
Clear commitments and contributions to Europe-wide take up during and beyond the project are expected, which could for example be in the form of follow-up actions funded by CEF or similar programmes.
This topic complements CEF-funded activities.
For the Coordination and Support Action: fast-track and mainstream the replication of innovative, urban, peri-urban and rural mobility solutions.
The following three main impacts are foreseen:
Firstly, proposals are expected to demonstrate how their activities will lead to fast-tracking and mainstreaming the replication of innovative, urban, peri-urban and rural mobility solutions. Proposals should as a minimum requirement provide; the expected number of people involved in the activities that will be undertaken in at least 20 cities/municipalities addressed by the project, information as to how their capacity will be improved to develop urban mobility and investment plans for deployment of innovative transport solutions. Secondly, the CSA is expected to lead to new research and innovation collaborations in sustainable urban mobility between organisations (public/ private), especially those located in countries that are more advanced and those located in countries lagging behind in the deployment of urban mobility innovations.
For the Coordination and Support Action: prepare for the deployment of Urban Air Mobility in urban and peri-urban areas
This action is expected to address the Amsterdam Drone Declaration[5] which ""called upon urban transport actors, policy makers and associations to pioneer cases demonstrating which systems, solutions and services seamlessly integrate smart multimodal solutions"" and which ""invited cities and regions to co-create with the citizens the public conditions and the infrastructure for integrated air and ground smart mobility solutions to flourish, where new and clean technologies, big data, real-time information and corresponding business models converge towards the enablement and realisation of “mobility as a service”.
The expected impact of this CSA project is to provide especially cities and regions with better planning tools and knowledge to integrate new applications of urban air mobility in their passenger and freight systems. This topic complements topic 'MG-3-6-2020: Towards sustainable urban air mobility'.

This topic is divided in 3 sub-topics.
Innovation Action:
The first part of this topic invites for proposals that combine new technologies and non-technological innovations, more effective forms of governance, and accompanying (policy-based) measures for all modes of transport.
The proposed projects should be carried out by local/regional authority-led consortia, covering three different urban or inter-urban areas that have a connection with the TEN-T network[1] or an equivalent size, major transport corridor, each of them facing different spatial, social and/or economic challenges and/or experiences with the organisation of large/sport events.
Each urban area should establish a living laboratory where under real life-conditions a set of innovative, complementary and reinforcing scalable mobility solutions, centered around a principal solution can be developed, tested and implemented in an integrated, multimodal approach. The participating urban areas, which may have a geographical coverage that goes as far as the full functional urban area, should demonstrate their common interests and outline how they will ensure a meaningful and close cooperation. Proposals should outline how the proposed approach meets the needs of an efficient, flexible and accessible TEN-T[2] urban node or a city located at an equivalent sized transport corridor, which in turn delivers an optimal use of the transport network and the integration of cost-effective solutions for energy supply/storage (with use of renewable energy as much as possible) and recharging networks for transport, and ICT networks for all modes of transport. The work of relevant Horizon 2020-funded projects, such as VITALNODES[3], could provide a useful starting point.
Proposals should explain how the proposed work will support the public authorities' efforts to implement their Sustainable Urban Mobility Plan, in combination with urban (land) planning and development, and infrastructure planning and operations. Attention should be paid to issues related to vulnerable groups of citizens, gender issues and health impact of mobility. Actions may include research activities, and some preparatory, take up and replication actions, as well as the development of tools to support planning and policy making. Work may also include demonstration of a resilient urban mobility system, capable to address particular challenges in the organisation of large/sport events. Proposals are encouraged to incorporate new approaches to increase the availability and integration of data to support policymaking and business activities in smart, zero and low-emission mobility and to explore innovative ways of increasing the share of active modes of transport.
To capture impacts, the activities should include monitoring, for example, aspects such as modal share, energy intensity, level of emissions, impact on health, transport network performance (demand and supply) and connectivity through interoperability and multimodality. Projects are expected to collaborate with the established impact evaluation framework (using both clear baselines and measurable impact indicators), as well the dissemination and information exchange framework put in place in the field of urban mobility by the Commission.
Additionally, proposals should seek to establish financial and institutional/organisational cooperation models to enable seamless transport across the TEN-T urban node area or equivalent.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 7 to 9 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts. Typically, projects should have duration of 48 months and foresee sufficient time for evaluation, dissemination and exploitation activities.
Coordination and Support Action: fast-track and mainstream the replication of innovative, urban, peri-urban and rural mobility solutions
The second part of this topic is a Coordination and Support Action that aims to fast-track and mainstream the replication of innovative, tested urban, peri-urban and rural mobility solutions (e.g. technological, non-technological, services, goods and infrastructure). Proposals are expected to set up and run a 'Fast-track to innovative sustainable motorised and non-motorised mobility' action (working title – proposers are invited to choose an appealing title), which offers support and services to at least 20 cities and municipalities or their organisational/functional groupings. A 'staged approach' is possible – taking into account mobility, investment or geographical needs as well as delivering the project efficiently. At least one-third of these 20 locations should be located in areas experiencing rapid economic and social change.
The proposal should include all of the following actions:
Support for the development and towards implementation of innovative mobility solutions in 4 broad areas:
Investments in and management of the transport network
Supporting modal shift towards more energy-efficient, safer and active (whenever possible) modes for transport of freight and/or passengers
New operating and business models in collective public and private transport (in any transport mode).
Supporting mobility actions within the scope of the European Innovation Partnership in Smart cities and communities (or its successor working on smart cities).
Development and implementation of a programme of tailored actions to deliver capacity building and institutional networking by:
a. Supporting staff exchanges, expert visits, and short term training.
b. Supporting the identification and access to financial and legal expertise, to define the feasibility to replicate an innovative mobility solution and to develop an innovation deployment programme of scale, notably: meetings with (potential) investors, opportunities for follow-up investments and identification of synergies with European funding and financing.
c. Providing matchmaking services for innovative mobility solutions establishing the link between ""suppliers"" that may be both public and private organisations, or groupings thereof (such as Horizon2020 funded projects) and ""customers"" that are mainly public organisations (such as city councils, regional authorities, transport operators or their groupings).
d. The project should deliver a set of recommendations to bridge the gap in the research and innovation performance and the deployment of the innovative mobility solutions across EU Member States.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of EUR 1 to 1.5 million each would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Coordination and Support Action: prepare for the deployment of Urban Air Mobility in urban and peri-urban areas
The integration of vertical urban mobility solutions (drones, and other forms of low-aerial mobility, as well as services) into existing surface multimodal transport (both freight and passenger) systems will add further complexity to the organisation of the urban and peri-urban transport and mobility services. It will require changes in public/shared transport management, logistics operations and infrastructure operations. With rapid technological progress in urban air mobility, especially local and regional public sector authorities are faced with challenges such as in financing, procuring, planning (infrastructure, systems), transport operations, safety, noise, security and public acceptance of these solutions.
The proposal should include all of the following actions:
a) To provide a knowledge base (dynamic updated, with a ""brand"") and to deliver a set of policy recommendations (in at least 8 languages – for use by local, regional, national and European public authorities, businesses and other organisations) for measures to (seamlessly) integrate the vertical and horizontal dimensions in urban and peri-urban mobility systems. These are notably:
Minimum required standards for products and processes in for ITS-type applications, urban planning (SUMPs), data-exchange, energy infrastructure, payments, environmental objectives, travel information and possibly other sectors such as building, construction, health care, retail etc.
Foresight deployment scenarios of up to 10 possible use cases in 5 to 15 years; public acceptance, governance, mobility systems, energy supply systems, infrastructure, investment opportunities, funding and financing needs, and land-use. An approach to set up these scenarios with wide consultation should be included in the proposal to ensure that social acceptance aspects are fully understood.
Tools for exchange and learning of urban air mobility with and to public authorities (notably local and regional), businesses civil society and research organisations.
b) To provide specific project development support and technical assistance for up to 10 deployment 'use cases' in locations (or groups thereof) with a demonstrated commitment from public and private organisations that are planning to start testing urban air mobility applications in the next 3 years. The type of support should as minimum include feasibility and market studies, programme and urban planning actions (for example procurement strategies).
This proposal should work closely together with the ongoing actions of the European Innovation Partnership in Smart cities (or its successor) and CIVITAS (or its successor) and possibly other networks with a strong participation of local and regional authorities.
The proposal should propose actions for cooperation with EASA, the SESAR Joint Undertaking, EUROCONTROL and the European U-Space Demonstrator network to ensure that project results are fed into developments in the institutional, regulatory and architectural frameworks for a competitive U-space services market.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of EUR 1 to 1.5 million each would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
For the Innovation Action:
Projects should act as European demonstration-type (""lighthouse"")[4] examples for integrating new scalable technologies and measures into city transport operations and existing transport infrastructures at real-life scale in order to achieve long-term decarbonisation impacts; reliable solutions for a more sustainable, inclusive, safe and secure mobility system, including for the secure mobility of people and freight during major/sport events; clear improvements of the efficiency and accessibility of the transport networks/systems covering the TEN-T urban nodes or equivalent, and their access to the relevant TEN-T corridor(s) or equivalent transport corridors for transport of freight and/or passengers. Positive long term impacts on social cohesion, economic development and public perception – resulting in behavioural change and policy change - are anticipated.
Projects will contribute to the development of the existing European knowledge base on the effectiveness and impacts resulting from the implementation of innovative mobility solutions.
Clear commitments and contributions to Europe-wide take up during and beyond the project are expected, which could for example be in the form of follow-up actions funded by CEF or similar programmes.
This topic complements CEF-funded activities.
For the Coordination and Support Action: fast-track and mainstream the replication of innovative, urban, peri-urban and rural mobility solutions.
The following three main impacts are foreseen:
Firstly, proposals are expected to demonstrate how their activities will lead to fast-tracking and mainstreaming the replication of innovative, urban, peri-urban and rural mobility solutions. Proposals should as a minimum requirement provide; the expected number of people involved in the activities that will be undertaken in at least 20 cities/municipalities addressed by the project, information as to how their capacity will be improved to develop urban mobility and investment plans for deployment of innovative transport solutions. Secondly, the CSA is expected to lead to new research and innovation collaborations in sustainable urban mobility between organisations (public/ private), especially those located in countries that are more advanced and those located in countries lagging behind in the deployment of urban mobility innovations.
For the Coordination and Support Action: prepare for the deployment of Urban Air Mobility in urban and peri-urban areas
This action is expected to address the Amsterdam Drone Declaration[5] which ""called upon urban transport actors, policy makers and associations to pioneer cases demonstrating which systems, solutions and services seamlessly integrate smart multimodal solutions"" and which ""invited cities and regions to co-create with the citizens the public conditions and the infrastructure for integrated air and ground smart mobility solutions to flourish, where new and clean technologies, big data, real-time information and corresponding business models converge towards the enablement and realisation of “mobility as a service”.
The expected impact of this CSA project is to provide especially cities and regions with better planning tools and knowledge to integrate new applications of urban air mobility in their passenger and freight systems. This topic complements topic 'MG-3-6-2020: Towards sustainable urban air mobility'.

","19 September 2018","Specific Challenge:
A metropolitan area, ""agglomeration"" or ""commuter belt"" (with important cross-docking activities), is a region consisting of a densely populated urban core and its less-populated surrounding territories, that is sharing industry, infrastructure and housing. An efficient multimodal transport network at different spatial levels is fundamental to allow a smooth functioning both in such areas and with their connected surrounding regions thus encouraging mobility and enhancing/preserving social inclusion. However, the transport infrastructure needed could cause important negative externalities and even induce unbridled suburbanization.
The introduction of new forms of people mobility and freight distribution, such as innovative soft mobility schemes, drive-sharing, ride-sharing, crowd shipping, crowd delivery, connected and automated vehicles, innovative flying vehicles, Mobility as a Service, could revolutionise transport demand with major consequences for the spatial organisation of cities and their local neighbourhoods. Mitigating the negative impacts of transport and substantially contribute to the achievement of the COP 22 goals must be pursued.
To address these challenges and in line with the guidelines to implement SUMP, a multi-dimensional approach is needed assessing new forms of mobility in all transport modes, their infrastructures, travel flux evolvement, spatial-economic development, environmental and quality-of-life issues, governance issues across spatial and institutional levels and user behavioural aspects. Development of vertical spatial planning can be included. Models should be proposed to support decision-makers in assessing evolution and potential rebound effects of their plans.
GNSS can contribute to boosting new forms of mobility and allow for a more efficient use of transport infrastructure. A large potential stemming from the combination and integration of GNSS with communication technology and telematics platforms remains so far untapped.
Scope:
Proposals should address one or several of the following:
Address environmental, socio-cultural and spatial impacts of planning in large metropolitan regions, whilst also enhancing connectivity; governance and institutional issues should be included.
Identification of new forms of mobility (including trips not covered by metropolitan radial transport infrastructure) with the potential to have the greatest impact on spatial redesign of urban and low-density areas - improving the balance between city and rural development -, on urban space sharing (including pedestrians), on new public and private service allocation patterns, on investments in infrastructure, and new solutions for collective transport and transport planning. Identify ways to promote their implementation of the new forms of mobility both in passenger and freight transport.
Use of geolocalization data, including Galileo and EGNOS for cooperative mobility in combination with other communication and telematic data to foster a more efficient use of infrastructure and reduction of air pollution.
Suggest appropriate measures to ensure the lowest carbon and air pollutant level of transport with particular consideration for the interdependencies between different spatial patterns of production/consumption (i.e. localization of production sites and relevant schemes of distribution to final consumers) and the energy and carbon intensity of the related transport systems. Collection and analysis of comprehensive data to provide a sound basis for future planning.
Comprehensive planning for the entire functional area (defined as an area of intensive commuter movements and/or freight distribution), adapting, further developing and extending the Sustainable Urban Mobility Plan (SUMP)[1] concept, considering specific needs of metropolitan regions, new operating models in collective public and private transport, overcoming social segregation and inequalities, including gender inequalities, in access to education, jobs, health and leisure. Innovative planning concepts (e.g multi-state planning, performance-based planning, scenario techniques and community planning) should also be considered with the aim to ensuring accessibility, social justice and equity in the mobility of all citizens groups. Coordinated infrastructure development: balancing long-term environmental goals with other development aims (e.g. effective land use and preservation of natural zones), developing environmental high-performance infrastructure (e.g. light rail), upgrading/ repurposing existing infrastructure, improving connectivity to the TEN-T and overall resilience of the region.
Coordinated development of sustainable policies with proven environmental impact, e.g. air-quality and noise-sensitive traffic management, including ""nowcasting"" as well as long-term strategy, region-wide freight and logistics concepts, shared mobility and innovative collective mobility promotion and incentives/disincentives for access to urban centres.
Involvement of local authorities, transport operators in research is essential to ensure the appropriate implementation, in line with SUMP guidelines, as well as modelling and recording reactions of users to changes in infrastructure and mobility options (rebound effects) to support future decision-making and ensuring citizens' engagement. Users' involvement is encouraged, as it is important to reach effective changes in behaviour.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU between EUR 5 and 8 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
In line with the Union's strategy for international cooperation in research and innovation, international cooperation is encouraged. In particular, proposals should foresee twinning with entities participating in projects funded by US DOT to exchange knowledge and experience and exploit synergies.[2]
Expected Impact:
Research will provide cities, regional and national authorities and spatial planners with evidence of long term impacts of innovative transport technologies and business models. It will aid decision makers to better anticipate and plan necessary investments, adaptation and spatial re-design strategies in view of taking full advantage of the new forms of mobility for improving competitiveness, sustainability, social cohesion, equity, and citizen well-being. Research will also contribute to devising transport planning strategies that contribute to a balanced development between urban and rural areas.
The innovation processes and final impacts should be systematically evaluated in terms of their contribution to environmental health, to enhanced accessibility to the centre of the metropolitan region as well as to the TEN-T corridors, to regional economic performance, social cohesion and overall regional development potential.
To meet the challenge of reducing the environmental impact of commuting and inter-urban transport proposals must demonstrate their contribution towards the following objectives:
• Reduced congestion, energy, emissions of air pollutants, carbon footprint, noise and land-use within the identified metropolitan regions.
• Increased coordination between multimodal infrastructure mobility and spatial-economic development, including reduction of inequalities.
• Increased inter-modality and higher resilience of the transport system between the metropolitan region and the neighbouring cities and rural areas.

[1]The Sustainable Urban Mobility Plan concept [see Annex I to COM(2013)913] considers the functional urban area and proposes that action on urban mobility is embedded into a wider urban and territorial strategy. Therefore, these Plans should be developed in cooperation across different policy areas and sectors (transport, land-use and spatial planning, environment, economic development, social policy, health, road safety, etc.); across different levels of government and administration; as well as with authorities in neighbouring areas – both urban and rural. Sustainable Urban Mobility Plans are about fostering a balanced development and a better integration of the different urban mobility modes

The market for deep renovation of buildings needs to be transformed in terms of technologies, processes and business models. More action is needed for Europe to achieve the higher rates of buildings renovations and spread clean energy technologies in the existing European building stock in order to meet long-term climate and energy targets. In particular, deep renovations need to become more attractive to all relevant stakeholders, more reliable in terms of performance, less disruptive for occupants (especially in residential buildings), less time-consuming, less energy-intensive from a life cycle perspective, more environmentally friendly regarding applied materials and more cost-effective, but also enabling new functions the buildings will play in the energy system of the future (flexibility, storage and RES generation). There is a need to demonstrate and roll out holistic consumer-centred solutions that involve the whole value chain, ensuring high levels of comfort and a high quality of the indoor environment.
Scope:
Projects are expected to increase the depth and breadth of renovations, while integrating clean energy technologies into the building envelop and/or systems.
Proposals are expected, as a minimum, to include the following activities:
Demonstrate deep and/or NZEB renovation approaches more reliable, faster, cheaper and easier to implement than standard practices while avoiding other harmful unintended consequences (e.g. on environment or health);
Demonstrate seamless and cost-effective integration of clean energy solutions in the building envelop and/or systems enabling buildings to play an active role in the energy system (RES generation, flexibility, storage)
Demonstrate a high replication, as much as possible across regions and climatic zones, different economic and social conditions, sustainability and market change potential of the proposed solutions including viable concepts for financing the renovation;
Tackle all relevant barriers (e.g. uptake by the professionals, financing, legal/regulatory framework, decision-making etc.) and suggest solutions to the relevant stakeholders;
Demonstrate effective involvement of, and communication and dissemination to the buildings supply chain, and to the building owners/tenants and other relevant stakeholders.
In addition, proposals should, as much as possible:
Include convincing business models (e.g. combination of smart energy services);
Offer guarantees of energy performance and consumer service;
Employ innovative working practices, processes and offers;
Propose attractive package solutions which offer multiple benefits;
Include monitoring of the real energy performance in-use before and after the renovation.
Furthermore, proposals may also, where relevant:
Establish new or amend existing standards, certificates, protocols or other quality assurance mechanisms including for skilled workers;
Address split incentives and/or counter-productive structures, regulations and incentives;
Pursue step-by-step renovation approaches;
Include one-stop-shop approaches;
Include building logbooks/passports and/or individual building renovation roadmaps and related concepts, as well as lean production approaches;
Offer guarantees of absence of health or environmental risks for workers and users;
Highlight the increased marked value of energy efficient property (green investments);
Tackle peak load savings and demand response;
Improve the Smartness Readiness Indicator (SRI) of the dwelling.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 1 and 2 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
Proposals are expected to demonstrate the impacts listed below, using quantified indicators and targets wherever possible:
Primary Energy savings triggered by the project (in GWh/year)
Investments in sustainable energy triggered by the project (in million Euro);
Replication of the chosen renovation approach in specific districts/ cities/ regions/ countries to reach an increased rate of deep/nZEB renovation at large scale;
Number of public or private renovation schemes set up;
Building renovations triggered (in number of dwellings or square meters).
Additional positive effects can be quantified and reported when relevant and wherever possible:
Reduction of the greenhouse gases emissions (in tCO2-eq/year) and/or air pollutants (in kg/year) triggered by the project.
Renewable energy generation triggered by the project (in GWh/year).

Urban mobility is in transition. This is a result of, for example, changing user needs; emerging transport technologies; new transport services using new business models; and new institutional and financing structures. Greater data availability provides new opportunities for evidence-based policy and policymakers aim at an ever-increasing integration of urban mobility policy with other sectorial policies. The impacts of this change will go far beyond the transport sector and influence other sectors that are transport-reliant.
The policy impacts, individually and in combination, of new solutions, which are at different levels of maturity, are not clear yet. There are many open questions about how policymakers should react and how Sustainable Urban Mobility Plans (SUMPs), and other sectorial policies that affect urban mobility, should respond and adapt to these potential disruptive changes. Therefore, research is necessary to improve the understanding of the impacts of new urban mobility solutions on policy making.
This topic covers passenger transport and freight transport. It covers urban and peri-urban areas. Special attention should be paid to the needs of vulnerable groups and users with different cultural backgrounds taking into account gender issues; and to the specific context of areas that are undergoing rapid economic change.
Scope:
This topic will be implemented through two sub-topics with different types of actions: Proposals should address one of the two.
A) Research and innovation actions: This sub-topic asks to examine the impacts of new mobility solutions, addressing the changing mobility patterns and set up of mobility services, including possible negative effects, and covers all relevant transport modes (including active modes) and vehicle types. City-led proposals should address one or more of the following aspects:
investments in and management of the transport network, with attention for facilities for recharging; transport system resilience; and transport demand management tools (such as pricing; low emission zones; parking management; one way traffic);
the specific challenges in areas undergoing rapid economic change, for example in institutional setup; policy coherence; policymakers mind-set; outdated or incomplete legislation/methodologies; and data/statistics;
new operating and business models in collective public and private transport;
pathways to tackling congestion and reducing levels of car use through decoupling economic growth and high mobility from traffic growth;
implications for and interaction with urban planning and design including inputs for developing SUMPs.
Proposals should incorporate new data-driven planning approaches.
The actions will also deliver at least three validated test cases (small pilot projects with quantified objectives in which public stakeholders and economic actors participate) that take into account different political and socio-economic contexts. The active participation of a small number of representatives from authorities of small and medium-sized cities in proposals should be ensured.
B) Coordination and support actions: This sub-topic addresses the facilitation of knowledge exploitation and support to the cooperation between projects and stakeholders involved in the projects under the first sub-topic, and from across CIVITAS 2020. This Coordination and Support Action should also consolidate the common ‘CIVITAS Process and Impact Evaluation Framework’ and ensure the continuity of a ‘CIVITAS Secretariat’ as well as financing of CIVINets.
Proposals should present innovative approaches for all of the following needs:
- local capacity building and training in deploying innovative mobility solutions;
- networking cities and engaging with stakeholders working at the local level, overcoming language and contextual barriers;
- reinforcing the involvement of the CIVITAS cities from different CIVITAS-Phases in the CIVITAS network;
- partnering with industry and civil society in navigating through transition and change;
- implementing a communication and dissemination strategy with high impact actions.
In order to maximise impacts, and in the context of CIVITAS 2020, all projects funded under this topic and other relevant topics (for example dealing with SUMPs) shall work together and exchange information and practical experiences
In line with the Union’s strategy for international cooperation in research and innovation[1] international cooperation is encouraged, especially with the USA, China and India
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 2 to 4 million each for Research and Innovation actions, and of up to EUR 3 million for the Coordination and Support Action, could address this specific challenge appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
Proposals addressing sub-topic A) above, will produce new, practice-based knowledge on how to navigate urban mobility policy through transition taking into account legacy systems and the need to integrate new solutions that are at different levels of maturity. They will provide added-value inputs and contribute to evidence-based policy making at local, regional, national and EU levels. Proposals should demonstrate how their work will support effectively mobility policies in the cities' efforts to follow a viable transformation path towards sustainable mobility.
The results of the actions will feed into future EU initiatives, for example on Sustainable Urban Mobility Planning (SUMPs); cooperative-ITS; travel and traffic information; low-emission logistics; and future infrastructure networks, including links to the TEN-T and can help improve Air Quality Plans.
Proposals addressing sub-topic B) will help to promote the take up of innovation that leads to more effective and efficient transition of urban mobility systems by strengthening the mechanisms for urban mobility policy making and planning. A ‘CIVITAS Secretariat’ will be continued. Capacity building; engaging; partnering; and communication and dissemination actions will aim at a maximum impacts and reach of target audiences.
This results in a developing knowledge-base, technical capacity, harmonised evaluation activities, and support for up-scaling and knowledge transfer which is available to cities and other interested parties. Clear commitments and contribution from the action's participants to Europe-wide take up are expected. The Coordination and Support Action must ensure both continuation of CIVITAS support activities and also support for future CIVITAS-type actions.

B) Coordination and support actions: This sub-topic addresses the facilitation of knowledge exploitation and support to the cooperation between projects and stakeholders involved in the projects under the first sub-topic, and from across CIVITAS 2020. This Coordination and Support Action should also consolidate the common ‘CIVITAS Process and Impact Evaluation Framework’ and ensure the continuity of a ‘CIVITAS Secretariat’ as well as financing of CIVINets.
Proposals should present innovative approaches for all of the following needs:
- local capacity building and training in deploying innovative mobility solutions;
- networking cities and engaging with stakeholders working at the local level, overcoming language and contextual barriers;
- reinforcing the involvement of the CIVITAS cities from different CIVITAS-Phases in the CIVITAS network;
- partnering with industry and civil society in navigating through transition and change;
- implementing a communication and dissemination strategy with high impact actions.
In order to maximise impacts, and in the context of CIVITAS 2020, all projects funded under this topic and other relevant topics (for example dealing with SUMPs) shall work together and exchange information and practical experiences
In line with the Union’s strategy for international cooperation in research and innovation[1] international cooperation is encouraged, especially with the USA, China and India
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 2 to 4 million each for Research and Innovation actions, and of up to EUR 3 million for the Coordination and Support Action, could address this specific challenge appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
Proposals addressing sub-topic A) above, will produce new, practice-based knowledge on how to navigate urban mobility policy through transition taking into account legacy systems and the need to integrate new solutions that are at different levels of maturity. They will provide added-value inputs and contribute to evidence-based policy making at local, regional, national and EU levels. Proposals should demonstrate how their work will support effectively mobility policies in the cities' efforts to follow a viable transformation path towards sustainable mobility.
The results of the actions will feed into future EU initiatives, for example on Sustainable Urban Mobility Planning (SUMPs); cooperative-ITS; travel and traffic information; low-emission logistics; and future infrastructure networks, including links to the TEN-T and can help improve Air Quality Plans.
Proposals addressing sub-topic B) will help to promote the take up of innovation that leads to more effective and efficient transition of urban mobility systems by strengthening the mechanisms for urban mobility policy making and planning. A ‘CIVITAS Secretariat’ will be continued. Capacity building; engaging; partnering; and communication and dissemination actions will aim at a maximum impacts and reach of target audiences.
This results in a developing knowledge-base, technical capacity, harmonised evaluation activities, and support for up-scaling and knowledge transfer which is available to cities and other interested parties. Clear commitments and contribution from the action's participants to Europe-wide take up are expected. The Coordination and Support Action must ensure both continuation of CIVITAS support activities and also support for future CIVITAS-type actions.

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Forests play a vital role in Europe's economy, society and environment[1]. Scenarios likely to keep the global warming below 2oC (Paris Agreement goal) would entail a substantial reduction of anthropogenic GHG emissions, through far-reaching changes to energy systems, land use and associated value chains. The second consumer-driven factor of GHG emissions is the construction sector (ca. 15%), implying a significant role for forest-based products. The forest-based sector can contribute to climate change mitigation through increasing sinks in and reducing emissions from living biomass, soils and wood products, and the substitution of non-renewable resources through the sustainable use of material and energy use of wood-based materials. The combined sink and substitution effects of wood value chains can provide a key mitigation option, provided that changes in fossil and biogenic carbon are taken into account in a comprehensive and balanced manner. Climate change is at the same time increasing forests' vulnerability. Several research projects[2] and COST Actions[3] launched in FP7 looked into the development of innovative, resource efficient wood-based products. While ensuring the sustainability of forest production systems under changing climate conditions remains a long-term objective for the sector, a key challenge now is to further develop and deploy the technological advancements of environmental and micro/macroclimate-friendly wood-based value chains on the ground.
Scope:
A. [2019] Building with wood (IA)
Proposals shall develop and test new technologies and environmental friendly solutions for the use of wood-based materials in the (re)construction and/or retrofitting of buildings. Proposals should also explore options for building with wood in combination with composite/hybrid materials, linkages with other nature-based solutions, make use of ICT, and consider LCA and carbon accounting, ‘environmental documentation’ (i.e. product definitions, standards and construction codes), performance standards, public policies and regulations, consumer perception and engagement/co-creation. Activities could include limited research and shall produce plans and arrangements or designs for new, altered or improved products, processes or services. For this purpose they may include prototyping, testing, demonstrating, piloting, large-scale product validation and market replication. Proposals shall ensure that relevant actors (researchers, citizens, policy makers from urban/rural areas, businesses, architects, site-managers, etc.) work together during the whole research and innovation process in order to better align the process and its outcomes with the societal values, needs and expectations.
B. [2020] Resilient forest systems (RIA)
Proposals shall aim at enhancing the adaptation of forest ecosystems (both primary and secondary) and forest production systems to the growing societal demands for forest products (i.e. wood and non-wood) and ecosystem services, considering trade-offs, climate change and vulnerability to natural disturbances (e.g. storms, droughts, pathogens, wild fires). Restoration of degraded ecosystems and natural expansion of forests, considering the long-term rural development, climate change mitigation objectives and biodiversity enhancement are also in the scope. Proposals shall encompass a varied range of forest and site types and tailored forest management systems representative of Europe's biogeographic regions. Proposals shall cover multiple parts of the production cycle and related operations, from regeneration/planting to harvesting, shall consider jointly supply (i.e. primary production) and demand (i.e. socio-economic) factors, and are expected to be interdisciplinary[4] in nature.
Both sub-topics (A and B) are suitable for INCO and SMEs participation, and are expected to integrate technology with SSH and RRI aspects.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of the order of EUR 10 million for sub-topic A and 5 million for sub-topic B would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
In the framework of SDG 9, 11, 13 and 15, , the EU's Forest Strategy 2013, the Circular Economy Package 2015, the Paris Agreement 2015, the EU's Bioeconomy Strategy 2018, and the EU Action Plan for Nature, People and the Economy, proposals are expected to assess how they will contribute to:
Increased resource and/or energy efficiency and added value and minimising pollution and the environmental footprint (emissions of GHG and air pollutants included) in the construction sector in the cities, by specific amounts/proportions to be specified in the proposals, by 2030 [sub-topic A];
Enhanced connectivity of rural-urban areas and their overall contribution to a resilient, circular and competitive, forest-based bioeconomy, by 2025 [sub-topic A];
Increased long-term resilience of forest production systems and associated value chains to climate/environmental change and societal demand [sub-topic B];
Protection and restoration of biodiversity of primary and secondary forest[sub-topic B];
Enhanced contribution of the forest-based sector to long-term climate change mitigation, adaptation and rural development objectives [sub-topics A & B];
Also in the long-term, prompt a sizeable positive change to European landscapes and economies, by keeping the countryside green and serving to make cities greener, and increasing the share of both decent and green jobs [sub-topics A & B].
Advance available solutions from TRL 4-5 to TRL 6-7 for sub-topic A and from TRL 3-4 to TRL 5 sub-topic B.

[1]Forests cover more 40 % of the EU's landmass, represent 70 % of Europe’s freshwater repository, remove the equivalent of 9 % of GHG emitted by other parts of the economy, and provide for a wide range of other social, economic and ecological services. The forest-based sector provides income for 16 million forest owners and 3-4 million workers in rural areas, and represents some 8% of the EU's total manufacturing value.

","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
A precondition for active demand is for consumers to be aware of their own potential to permanently or temporarily reduce energy consumption; and moreover, for them to know how to offer this potential to the market and what it would represent in terms of monetary value by bringing benefits to the energy system.
Different forms of collective action have the potential to assist consumers in forming critical mass and to facilitate increased uptake of energy efficiency & active demand solutions and services. Although collective actions on energy efficiency have emerged in recent years, a lack of awareness on the potential benefits of such actions, together with regulatory barriers, continues to hamper their full development and uptake.
Finally, important challenges involve installed appliances (such as boilers for space and/or water heating) of which a big share is inefficient and fossil-fuel based, resulting in increased fuel consumption and fuel costs for households. Informing consumers of the potential energy savings and their monetization, as well as other benefits such as increased comfort and improved air quality, can result in increased motivation for replacing inefficient appliances, thereby permanently reducing consumption.
Scope:
2018:
The proposed action should develop activities informing and motivating consumers to change old and inefficient installed appliances with the highest energy saving potential (e.g. boilers, local space heaters, air heaters) to more efficient and clean energy heating and/or cooling solutions. While financial aspects (cost savings, payback period) would be the main motivating factor and therefore should be presented in a precise and credible manner, other aspects such as increased comfort and aesthetics, safety, improved air quality, or possible participation in demand-response should be the integral part of the actions in order to unlock the full potential of multiple benefits of energy efficiency improvements.
2019 and 2020:
The proposed action should set up and/or support energy communities (consumer cooperatives, consumer collective purchase groups, and/or other consumer driven collective actions) to increase energy efficiency and/or optimise energy management to integrate a higher share of renewable energy (generated locally or provided from the grid) within the community by, for example, combining collective solutions to distributed generation, distributed storage, and/or demand-response aggregation. The focus of the proposed action should be on households, however, this does not preclude the complementary involvement of non-residential buildings.
The proposed action should cover the following points:
Identify and address regulatory barriers and contractual conditions with utilities, suppliers, grid operators, technology providers etc. for cooperative actions, possibly linking activities with structural solutions involving public authorities;
Demonstrate that collectively organised energy-related actions are financially viable and attractive to the consumer-members of the energy community.
In addition, the proposed action could cover the following points, as relevant:
Identify and implement solutions to address split incentives (e.g. allowing tenants to set up/join the consumer driven collective action);
Demonstrate collective actions of energy consumers based on the solutions and business approaches using digital tools and technologies (such as digital platforms or blockchain transactions). If the proposed action includes smart home/IoT solutions, it should link to the developments under the call DT-ICT-10-2018: Interoperable and smart homes and grids.
Relevant for the three years:
The proposed actions should address the risk of ""rebound effects"" and propose measures to counteract them, where relevant. All relevant stakeholders necessary for the successful implementation of the action should be involved and relevant consumer organisations, in particular, should be either directly involved or their support demonstrated in the proposal. Proposed actions should also take issues of consumer data ownership and data privacy into account, where relevant. The proposed actions are invited to build on experiences and lessons learned in other relevant projects and programmes[1].
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 1 and 2 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
Proposals are expected to demonstrate, depending on the scope addressed, the impacts listed below using quantified indicators and targets, wherever possible:
Primary energy savings triggered by the project (in GWh/year);
Investments in sustainable energy triggered by the project (in million Euro);
Contribution to reducing regulatory barriers and improving contractual conditions;
Increase domestic uptake of energy efficient products and services;
Involvement of at least 5.000 consumers per million Euro of EU funding.

European households continue to spend an increasing share of income on energy, leading to higher rates of energy poverty and negatively affecting living conditions and health. Recent estimates suggest that more than 50 million Europeans are affected by energy poverty[1]. Although roots of this phenomenon lie mainly in low incomes and poor thermal efficiency of buildings, energy efficiency measures at the household level and increased use of renewable energy are key tools in addressing energy poverty and can bring energy savings, leading to lower fuel costs and improved living conditions. The issue is in part exacerbated by a lack of sufficient knowledge on how to identify energy poor households.
In this context, the role of local and national authorities, related networks and initiatives[2], and availability of support schemes are important to ensure the sustainability and larger scale uptake of the measures.
Energy Efficiency Obligation Schemes[3] can also be used to promote social aims, such as tackling energy poverty. The obligated parties (utilities) have potentially at their disposal the necessary data and means to identify energy poverty among their customers and effectively address it by fulfilling in this way the energy efficiency obligation. Building the capacity of the obligated parties is needed in order to spread such schemes across the EU.
Scope:
Actions should contribute to actively alleviating energy poverty and developing a better understanding of the types and needs of energy poor households and how to identify them, taking into account gender differences where relevant, building on any existing initiatives such as the European Energy Poverty Observatory.
The proposed action should cover one or more of the following:
Facilitate behaviour change and implementation of low-cost energy efficiency measures tailored for energy poor households (e.g. provision of information and advice, energy efficiency services such as draught proofing or optimisation of existing building technology systems, as well as energy efficiency devices & kits such as low-energy lighting);
Support the set-up of financial and non-financial support schemes for energy efficiency and/or small scale renewable energy investments for energy poor households. These actions should be embedded in, and add value to, structural frameworks and activities involving local, regional, and national authorities, and/or networks such as the Covenant of Mayors;
Develop, test and disseminate innovative schemes for energy efficiency/RES investments established by utilities or other obligated parties under Article 7.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 1 and 2 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.

Actions should contribute to actively alleviating energy poverty and developing a better understanding of the types and needs of energy poor households and how to identify them, taking into account gender differences where relevant, building on any existing initiatives such as the European Energy Poverty Observatory.
The proposed action should cover one or more of the following:
Facilitate behaviour change and implementation of low-cost energy efficiency measures tailored for energy poor households (e.g. provision of information and advice, energy efficiency services such as draught proofing or optimisation of existing building technology systems, as well as energy efficiency devices & kits such as low-energy lighting);
Support the set-up of financial and non-financial support schemes for energy efficiency and/or small scale renewable energy investments for energy poor households. These actions should be embedded in, and add value to, structural frameworks and activities involving local, regional, and national authorities, and/or networks such as the Covenant of Mayors;
Develop, test and disseminate innovative schemes for energy efficiency/RES investments established by utilities or other obligated parties under Article 7.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 1 and 2 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
The proposed actions are invited to build on experiences and lessons learned in other relevant projects and programmes[4].
Expected Impact:
Proposals are expected to demonstrate, depending on the scope addressed, the impacts listed below using quantified indicators and targets, wherever possible:
Primary energy savings triggered by the project (in GWh/year);
Investments in sustainable energy triggered by the project in(million Euro);
Contributions to policy development and to best practice development on energy poverty;
Support schemes established for energy efficiency and/or small-scale renewable energy investments and to be sustained beyond the period of EU-support.
Involvement of at least 5.000 consumers per million Euro of EU funding.
Additional positive effects can be quantified and reported when relevant and wherever possible:
Reduction of greenhouse gases emissions (in tCO2-eq/year) and/or air pollutants (in kg/year) triggered by the project.

","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
In the Energy Union Strategy, Energy Efficiency was recognised as a resource in its own right which should be enabled to compete on equal terms with generation capacity and to have primary consideration across all policies[1]. However, the structure of energy demand as well as the real value beyond the fuel's cost and the (energy and non-energy) impacts of energy efficiency are still not well understood with the effect that benefits of energy efficiency are not sufficiently taken into account in financial and political decision making, and planning, while prices of fossil fuels remain relatively low.
The topic addresses three different dimensions of this challenge with the aim to trigger actions which
make the energy efficiency first principle more operational (2018);
substantiate the demand side aspects in energy modelling (2019).
Scope:
2018:
The research projects should help to make the Energy Efficiency First principle more concrete and operational and to better understand its relevance for energy demand and supply and its broader impacts across sectors and markets. In particular, it needs to be analysed how energy efficiency programmes along the efficiency chain, i.e. end-use, operation, transmission and generation/utilisation of resources, can compete in reality with supply side investments (e.g. additional generation capacities or import capacities) including at the level of countries and having in mind limited public budgets. It would also be necessary to describe and assess how it interacts with and correlates to other policy objectives, at a policy level as well as at the level of implementation.
Actions which conceptualise and assess the impacts and model the energy efficiency first principle, in particular as regards:
its role and value in the energy system (e.g. for planning of generation assets and networks adequacy etc.) and the energy market (participation in capacity market, participation and impact on prices and costs on wholesale and balancing/reserve markets);
its role and value in financing decisions (considering as well that in some Member States retail prices do not reflect real costs);
its economic and social impacts;
its correlation and interaction with other policy objectives (e.g. renewable energy, demand response);
existing best practices worldwide where energy efficiency projects are given priority over additional supply side measures.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 1 million and 1.5 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
2019:
The aim of the action is to deepen the demand side-related parameters in existing models and to include new aspects and data sources (e.g. by tapping DSOs modelling for forecasting of distributed loads). In general, it is to be expected that the introduction of smart meters and smart equipment will lead to more accurate consumption data providing for a more holistic mapping of the demand side and thus for better projections inside energy policy development and a more effective regulatory framework.
The action should complement the existing demand side energy models by developing multiple-agent energy models and/or modelling segments and/or developing methodologies on how to improve and enhance the demand side aspects in modelling.
These models and/or methodologies should:
be compatible with the energy models most commonly used at European level;
model more accurately those aspects not yet sufficiently considered in the existing models;
make use of new data sources, including big data as for example generated by smart meters, smart buildings and smart equipment;
identify and refine the structure and patterns of demand and how it will develop;
contribute to an enhanced demand-side model to be consistently used at European level.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 1 million and 2 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
2018:
Actions are expected to support policies aiming to promote and implement the ""energy efficiency first-principle"" based on a sound assessment of the concept and its impacts. To this end, actions should lead to a better understanding of:
all relevant aspects linked to the ""energy efficiency first-principle"";
its impacts (e.g. technical, economic, socio-economic, and ecological etc.) on the relevant sectors and markets;
its potential across the different policy areas and sectors;
its consideration and valorisation in modelling and assessments; and
its interaction with other policy objectives both at policy level (e.g. climate and renewable policies, circular economy) and at the level of concrete application (e.g. design of buildings).
2019:

","Coordination and support action
","12 March 2019
","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
The delivery of the Energy Union targets requires the full engagement of the public sector at all governance levels.
Local and regional public authorities have a crucial role in setting ambitious energy efficiency strategies, for instance in the framework of the Covenant of Mayors for Climate & Energy and Smart Cities & Communities or the Clean Energy for All islands initiative. The political commitment at local level should be enhanced and the focus should turn to implementation and effective monitoring of concrete energy efficiency solutions and actions, which can contribute to modernise and decarbonise the European economy. Synergies should be sought, whenever possible, with local and regional air quality plans[1] and air pollution control programmes[2] to reduce costs since these plans rely to a large extent on similar measures and actions[3].
Support should continue and be reinforced in building capacity of public authorities and empowering them to take up their role of energy transition leaders at regional and local level, by permanently improving their skills as public entrepreneurs and supporters of market transformation towards more efficient energy systems.
At national level, the Energy Efficiency Directive has triggered numerous positive developments in the Member States by setting targets to incentivise and enable investment in energy efficiency programmes across all sectors. However, Member States have yet to fully implement the Directive and additional support in building capacity and know-how is needed.
Scope:
a) Support to local and regional public authorities
Proposers should aim to focus their proposed action on one of the following points:
Deliver higher quality and consistency of energy efficiency measures implemented through enhanced coordination of different administrative levels. Actions should lead to politically approved and jointly applied monitoring and verification schemes of energy efficiency measures across local and regional authorities, enhanced and better coordination of the energy efficiency measures implemented and more efficient use of public spending in energy efficiency;
Support public authorities in the development of transition roadmaps that clearly outline the path to the European long-term 2050 targets and inform the ongoing implementation of SEAPs/SECAPs or similar plans and the development of future plans/targets for 2030 and beyond. Actions should link closely to the Covenant of Mayors and/or Smart Cities and Communities initiatives;
Innovative ways to enable public engagement in the energy transition, developing interface capacities within public authorities to engage with civil society;
Deliver large-scale and action-oriented peer-to-peer learning programmes targeting cities and/or regions, with a strong replication potential European-wide. Proposals should develop transparent, effective and compelling programmes, building on existing initiatives and real needs and ensure embedded conditionalities such as institutionalisation of the skill base and impact monitoring. Programmes should deliver public entrepreneurs able to drive the sustainable energy transition in their respective territories within the Covenant Mayors and beyond.
b) Supporting the delivery of the Energy Efficiency Directive
Support will be provided to actions that are assisting Member States to fulfil their obligations under the Energy Efficiency Directive and help with its efficient implementation taking into account existing effective practices and experiences from across Europe. Actions may address, for example, the harmonisation of energy savings calculations under Article 3, implementing Energy Efficiency Obligation Schemes or alternative measures and setting up effective and consistent monitoring and verification systems under Article 7 or the removal of barriers to higher efficiency of the generation, transmission, distribution systems including demand response under Article 15.
Proposals should link into existing, relevant initiatives such as ManagEnergy and target a specific sector with high energy saving potential such as buildings, transport mobility, heating and cooling, or water infrastructure operation etc., as seen relevant by applicants.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 1 and 1.5 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
Proposals are expected to demonstrate, depending on the scope addressed, the impacts listed below, using quantified indicators and targets wherever possible:
Primary energy savings, renewable energy production and investments in sustainable energy triggered in the territory of participating parties by the project (respectively in GWh/year and in million Euro);
Number of public officers with improved capacity/skills;
Number of policies influenced through the action;
Number of Member States with improved implementation of Art 7. (Energy Efficiency Obligation schemes or alternative measures) / Energy savings achieved through successfully implemented Energy Efficiency Obligation schemes or alternative policy measures;
Number of Members States with improved and consistent monitoring and verification systems for energy savings across governance levels.

","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
In the Energy Union Strategy, Energy Efficiency was recognised as a resource in its own right, which should be enabled to compete on equal terms with generation capacity and to have primary consideration across all policies[1]. However, two additional aspects need to be taken into consideration in order to create effective future policy scenarios and allow for financial and political decision making, while prices of fossil fuels remain relatively low:
the real value beyond the fuel's cost and the (energy and non-energy) impacts of energy efficiency;
psychological and contextual features (such as consumers’ behavioural biases, superfluous complexity of alternative options or external barriers to energy efficiency) which can negatively impact the quality of consumers’ decision-making.
Scope:
a) Modelling multiple non-energy impacts
Actions are required to explain the transition of energy efficiency from a ""hidden fuel"" to the ""first fuel"" and make the value of the externalities triggered by energy efficiency investments more visible across a variety of areas. The analysis should go beyond the traditional measures of reducing energy demand and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions; it should include positive and negative externalities relating to other policies such as public health, air quality, impact on ecosystems, etc.
Actions should build upon the existing methodological frameworks and the work already developed in this field in order to:
create econometric models and other instruments able to quantify and when possible monetise direct and indirect non-energy impacts (both positive and negative) of energy efficiency investments, taking into account all possible challenges (e.g. rebound effect, double counting, etc.);
provide a simplified and evidence-based tool which can help policy makers at local, regional, national and European level in defining optimised short-term cost-effective policies and measures as well as long-term strategies in the energy domain;
disseminate the concept to households, businesses and financing institutions in order to increase awareness, information level, and investments in energy efficiency improvements.
b) Behavioural insights for energy efficiency interventions
Actions should test energy efficiency behavioural change interventions through field trials informed by behavioural science. These trials should be aimed at selecting effective approaches to deliver the largest impact and should be targeted to specific energy behaviours.
Research may involve a mix of methodologies including different qualitative and quantitative research methods (e.g. RCTs[2], A/B testing, before-and-after trials, observation, focus groups, surveys, exploitation of existing datasets, quasi-experiments, etc.).
Consortia should include, on the one hand, behavioural experts and, on the other, public authorities, DSOs and/or relevant civil society organizations (NGOs, associations, local energy communities, etc.) implementing energy efficiency related interventions.
Proposals should describe how the role and tasks of the various Consortia’s members will be coordinated. They should place emphasis on the European added-value of their outputs and the comparability of the results of different pilots in order to be relevant for European policy makers. The theoretical and empirical research chosen by the consortium should allow to draw conclusions regarding the best policy instruments (e.g. push and pull measures, price mechanisms, incentives, the leveraging on social norms, the provision of simplified real-time and possibly comparative information about one’s own consumption pattern, etc.), the relevant contextual aspects determining the efficiency of the intervention and, where possible, the long-term impacts of behaviourally informed policy interventions.
Proposals should build on relevant national and international projects and initiatives.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 1 and 2 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately[3]. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
Depending on the scope addressed, proposals are expected to identify the impacts listed below using quantified indicators and targets, wherever possible:
Support policies, at all governance levels, aiming to foster investments in Energy Efficiency improvements and best practice development (scope a and b);
Increased awareness among households, businesses and financing institutions (scope a and b);
Number of public officers, private actors and other stakeholders involved and reached out to, number of peer-reviewed articles produced, or references to impact assessments, strategy papers or other policy documents (scope a and b);
Increase awareness on multiple benefits among policy makers in other-than-energy policy departments e.g. using a simplified language in order to allow their inclusion in future policy developments and monitoring, impact assessments and policy evaluations (scope a);
Number of analysed scenarios, energy efficiency measures and of non-energy benefits (scope a);
Number of interventions designed using behavioural levers[4] and relevant behavioural biases and elements identified (scope b);
Number of consumers adopting a more sustainable energy consumption behaviour (scope b);
Primary energy savings triggered by the project (in GWh/year – scope b);
Investments in sustainable energy triggered by the project (million Euro – scope b).

a) Support to local and regional public authorities
The Commission considers it to be equally relevant to address one or more of the following bullet points, as appropriate:
Enhance decision-making processes of regional and local authorities, to deliver a higher quality, coherence and consistency of energy efficiency measures - and accelerate reaching targets. Actions should foster horizontal and vertical integration of different governance levels, joint application of the energy efficiency measures across local and regional authorities, improved monitoring and verification schemes, and more efficient use of public spending. Proposals should demonstrate political commitment and lead to subsequent institutionalisation of the improved processes in support of the Energy Union Governance Regulation.

Actions should link closely to the Covenant of Mayors initiative and the Energy Union Governance Regulation, where relevant.
Innovative ways to enable public engagement in the energy transition, developing interface capacities within public authorities to engage with civil society.
Deliver innovative capacity-building programmes for cities and/or regions to step up their capacity to drive the sustainable energy transition in their respective territories. Proposals should foster a sustained increase in the skill base of public authorities, adapted to their needs and challenges, and support the diffusion of the learning within participating organisations and beyond. The proposed actions should include a strategy to replicate results across Europe and a solid impact monitoring.
Proposals should build on existing initiatives such as the Covenant of Mayors[5], ManagEnergy[6] or any other relevant initiative as appropriate.
b) Supporting the delivery of the Energy Efficiency Directive
Proposers should focus their proposed action on:
Actions assisting Member States to fulfil their obligations under the Energy Efficiency Directive (EED) and – where relevant to the implementation of the EED – under the Energy Union Governance Regulation. Proposals should support efficient implementation by taking into account existing effective practices and experiences from across Europe. Proposals may address, for example, the harmonisation of energy savings calculations under Article 3, the effective implementation of Article 7 including consistent monitoring and verification systems, higher efficiency of the generation under Article 14 and of transmission or distribution systems under Article 15 or an efficient development and continuous reporting of Integrated National Energy and Climate Plans.

","25 January 2018
","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
The delivery of the Energy Union targets requires the full engagement of the public sector at all governance levels.
Local and regional public authorities have a crucial role in setting ambitious energy efficiency strategies, for instance in the framework of the Covenant of Mayors for Climate & Energy and Smart Cities & Communities or the Clean Energy for All islands initiative. The political commitment at local level should be enhanced and the focus should turn to implementation and effective monitoring of concrete energy efficiency solutions and actions, which can contribute to modernise and decarbonise the European economy. Synergies should be sought, whenever possible, with local and regional air quality plans[1] and air pollution control programmes[2] to reduce costs since these plans rely to a large extent on similar measures and actions[3].
Support should continue and be reinforced in building capacity of public authorities and empowering them to take up their role of energy transition leaders at regional and local level, by permanently improving their skills as public entrepreneurs and supporters of market transformation towards more efficient energy systems.
At national level, the Energy Efficiency Directive has triggered numerous positive developments in the Member States by setting targets to incentivise and enable investment in energy efficiency programmes across all sectors. However, Member States have yet to fully implement the Directive and additional support in building capacity and know-how is needed.
Scope:
a) Support to local and regional public authorities
Proposers should aim to focus their proposed action on one of the following points:
Deliver higher quality and consistency of energy efficiency measures implemented through enhanced coordination of different administrative levels. Actions should lead to politically approved and jointly applied monitoring and verification schemes of energy efficiency measures across local and regional authorities, enhanced and better coordination of the energy efficiency measures implemented and more efficient use of public spending in energy efficiency;
Support public authorities in the development of transition roadmaps that clearly outline the path to the European long-term 2050 targets and inform the ongoing implementation of SEAPs/SECAPs or similar plans and the development of future plans/targets for 2030 and beyond. Actions should link closely to the Covenant of Mayors and/or Smart Cities and Communities initiatives;
Innovative ways to enable public engagement in the energy transition, developing interface capacities within public authorities to engage with civil society;
Deliver large-scale and action-oriented peer-to-peer learning programmes targeting cities and/or regions, with a strong replication potential European-wide. Proposals should develop transparent, effective and compelling programmes, building on existing initiatives and real needs and ensure embedded conditionalities such as institutionalisation of the skill base and impact monitoring. Programmes should deliver public entrepreneurs able to drive the sustainable energy transition in their respective territories within the Covenant Mayors and beyond.
b) Supporting the delivery of the Energy Efficiency Directive
Support will be provided to actions that are assisting Member States to fulfil their obligations under the Energy Efficiency Directive and help with its efficient implementation taking into account existing effective practices and experiences from across Europe. Actions may address, for example, the harmonisation of energy savings calculations under Article 3, implementing Energy Efficiency Obligation Schemes or alternative measures and setting up effective and consistent monitoring and verification systems under Article 7 or the removal of barriers to higher efficiency of the generation, transmission, distribution systems including demand response under Article 15.
Proposals should link into existing, relevant initiatives such as ManagEnergy and target a specific sector with high energy saving potential such as buildings, transport mobility, heating and cooling, or water infrastructure operation etc., as seen relevant by applicants.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 1 and 1.5 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
Proposals are expected to demonstrate, depending on the scope addressed, the impacts listed below, using quantified indicators and targets wherever possible:
Primary energy savings, renewable energy production and investments in sustainable energy triggered in the territory of participating parties by the project (respectively in GWh/year and in million Euro);
Number of public officers with improved capacity/skills;
Number of policies influenced through the action;
Number of Member States with improved implementation of Art 7. (Energy Efficiency Obligation schemes or alternative measures) / Energy savings achieved through successfully implemented Energy Efficiency Obligation schemes or alternative policy measures;
Number of Members States with improved and consistent monitoring and verification systems for energy savings across governance levels.

","03 September 2019
","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
To put consumers / prosumers at the heart of the energy market and to develop and test new cost-effective solutions for consumers based on the next generation of energy services for consumers that are beneficial to the integration of RES into an efficient operation of the grid and of the power system, that will allow to better predict and incentivise consumer behaviour. Engaging consumers and prosumers in demand-response mechanisms and other energy services - based on dynamic prices as well as on incentives from grid operators to adjust energy consumption or production to help maintain frequency stability, manage congestion or address other grids constraints - has the potential to bring benefits to consumers and to the energy system.
Decentralised (renewable) energy production and digitalisation allow for new ways for consumers to engage in the energy transition, for example through energy cooperatives, peer-to-peer trading and citizen energy communities. Building and home automation allows for the integration of services to consumers and the creation of value by combining data and services across different sectors for example combining energy services (electricity, heat) with mobility (electric cars), health (assisted living).
Scope:
The proposals will develop and test novel solutions and tools for demand response and energy services, using real consumption data and feedback from the testing of services with the objective to improve predictability of consumption and consumer behaviour (aiming to create a digital twin of the consumer). The main focus will be on households, but other types of consumers (residential, industrial, commercial and tertiary, including prosumers who are self-consuming part of the energy they produce) may be included. Proposals will demonstrate services that bring a fair share of benefits to consumers and to the energy system, in particular the electricity grid. The proposals should take into account the existing EU framework and the proposed measures under the Clean Energy for all Europeans Package, including the relevant measures on demand response, active customers, energy communities and dynamic price contracts.
Proposals can target one or multiple types of loads (e.g. appliances, electric vehicles, power to heat / cool, etc.) as well as (small-scale) production (e.g. PV), include energy storage and one or several methods of aggregation (e.g. citizen energy communities). Preferably they should rely on advanced automation, advanced ICT tools and approaches (e.g. IoT, Big Data, AI, blockchain, etc.), communication protocols and interoperability.
Proposals are encouraged to include energy vectors other than just electricity (e.g. heating, cooling, water, wastes, etc.) , and are encouraged to include other services than energy (e.g. mobility, health, etc.).
Proposals should not only bring a perspective from the grid and the power system on consumers but also a perspective from consumers on the grid and the power system. For this purpose, social science and humanities-related work will be closely associated with the development of technological solutions from the beginning of the project (e.g. co-creation process involving both technology/ service providers and consumers) and not as an isolated task/work-package.
Privacy, consumer and personal data protection and cybersecurity should be addressed by the proposed solutions.
Proposals will demonstrate how they will use interoperable digital communication solutions, make use of existing standards, study what is the information that shall be exchanged and contribute to open platforms and market places that can be integrated with other services based on platforms.
Services, customer information, engagement strategies and contracts should be designed, tested and conclusions should be drawn to improve predictability of consumption and consumer behaviour, based on the different types of consumers (e.g. segmentation along different categories, e.g. social category, age, technology literacy, gender, etc.) on the considered location and climatic conditions and on the type and magnitude of incentives, putting the citizen at the centre of the proposed approach.
The participation of local energy communities, energy cooperatives, aggregators and local actors is encouraged. The participation of consumer associations in the project is an added value.
Proposals are expected to include clear business model development and a clear path to finance and deployment as a dedicated task, which confirms delivery of affordable energy in no more than 5 years, as well as a clear strategy for managing cybersecurity. Key partners should have the capability and interest in making the developed solution a core part of their business/service model to their clients. Proposals are expected to demonstrate knowledge of the relevant EU’s policies on smart homes and buildings, interoperability, Internet of Things and platforms for data exchange.
Proposals should include tasks or a specific work-package on the analysis of obstacles to innovation under the current context but also under the future market design context and foresee the coordination on policy relevant issues and obstacle to innovation (e.g. regulatory framework, business models, data management, consumer engagement) with similar EU-funded projects through the BRIDGE initiative[1]. An indicative budget share of at least 2% of the EU contribution is recommended for the research work associated with these issues.
Proposals should build upon the insights and results of projects that have already been selected in this field under Horizon 2020 (information can be found on the BRIGDE web site[2]) and demonstrate their innovative character.
Projects will cooperate with at least one of the projects supported under the topic LC-SC3-ES-5-2018-2020 that approach the challenge more from a grid perspective. Therefore, proposals will foresee a work package for cooperation with other selected projects and earmark appropriate resources (indicatively 5-10% of the requested EU contribution) for coordination and communication efforts and research work associated with cross-cutting issues[1]. Regarding data handling, data management and standardisation issues, proposers should comply with the requirements stated in the section 'Common requirements' of the introduction to the part on the Smart citizen-centred energy system.
TRL will range between 5 and 8 (see part G of the General Annexes). Proposers will indicate the estimates levels of TRL at the beginning and at the end of the project.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 4 to 6 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
The supported projects are expected to contribute to the following impacts:
Increased use of demand response across the European energy system;
Increased number and types of consumers engaged in demand-response across Europe;
Demonstrated and improved viability of innovative energy services, best practices and effective incentives that can be replicated at large scale;
Increased uptake of services that combine energy efficiency with other energy services, technologies and non-energy benefits;
Increased reliability of innovative energy services and accessibility to them Developed and demonstrated viable solutions for customers: best practices and effective incentives that can be replicated at large scale;
Increased predictability of consumption patterns and consumer behaviour;
Increased data protection and privacy for customers;
Improved modelling of the flexibility levers from the new energy services;
Increased share of energy or power that can be mobilised to provide flexibility to the grid and increase the hosting capacity for RES.
Proposals are invited to address at least 7 of the above impacts, substantiate them and include ad-hoc indicators to measure the progress against specific objectives of their choice that could be used to assess the progress during the project life. Indicators are expected to have clear and measurable targets.

","Research and Innovation action
","15 May 2018
","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Commercial deployment of CCS requires a significant reduction of the energy intensity of the CO2 capture process for power plants or other energy-intensive industries, and a substantial decrease of the cost of capture. A continuous effort is needed to develop and demonstrate new and advanced capture technologies, including new materials.
Scope:
The objective is the validation and pilot demonstration of advanced CO2 capture technologies that have shown a high potential for reduction of the energy penalty and a significant overall improvement of cost-efficiency of the whole capture process, but that are not yet commercial. Projects will test operating conditions and operational flexibility, and provide proof of the reliability and cost-effectiveness of these concepts, whilst at the same time evaluating the cost, technical requirements and operational and safety impacts on the associated transportation infrastructure, storage or utilisation of CO2, as part of their integration in a CCS cluster based on a whole system approach. The proposal should state credible and clearly defined targets and key performance indicators (KPIs) for the energy penalty reduction, the capture rate and the relative incremental operating costs of the capture process. Environmentally benign technologies have to be pursued and their environmental impact addressed in the project also in view of future scaling up.
Proposals are expected to bring technologies to TRL 5-7 (please see part G of the General Annexes). Technology development should be balanced by an assessment of the societal readiness towards the proposed innovations, including by identifying and involving relevant end users and societal stakeholders and analysing their concerns and needs using appropriate techniques and methods from the social sciences and humanities.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU in the range of EUR 5 to 10 million (depending on the degree of demonstration) would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
Significant, step-change advances in reductions in energy penalty and thus in the fuel-dependent cost of CO2 capture, facilitating safe and economic integration into industrial clusters - which will lower the barriers to the wider uptake of CCS, in particular for those sectors vulnerable to carbon leakage.

","Innovation action
","05 December 2017
","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Energy production costs on geographical island are up to ten times higher than on the mainland; therefore the large-scale deployment of local renewable energy sources and storage systems brings economic benefits and, at the same time, contributes to decarbonising the energy system of the island, reducing greenhouse gases emissions and improving, or at least not deteriorate, air quality.
Scope:
The proposed solutions will contribute to high levels of local renewable energy and a very significant reduction of the use of fossil fuel based energies (ideally achieving full decarbonisation for the whole island), covering also:
Improve integration and use of digitalised smart grids and/or thermal networks based on high flexibility services from distributed generation, local power balancing, demand response and storage of electricity, heating and cooling, water, etc.; including innovative approaches to energy storage at different scales.
Improved forecasting through comprehensive modelling of demand and supply (e.g. based on weather, wind, sun, etc.).
Projects should also deliver:
Effective business models for sustainable solutions for Renewable Energy Communities, in line with the recently adopted Renewable Energy Directive (Directive (EU) 2018/2001 );
Practical recommendations arising from project experience on:
regulatory and legal aspects;
gender and socio-economics (Social Sciences and Humanities);
storage and flexibility solutions (from short to seasonal timescales);
data management, data processing and related cyber security;
Contributions to environmental sustainability, in particular in view of the specificities of islands ecosystems;
Large scale implementation of self-consumption solutions in households, buildings and/or districts, supported by microgrids and decentralised small-scale storage systems.
Proposals will involve at least two Follower islands (geographical islands). The follower islands are to be members of the consortium although their participation in the project can be limited to actions allowing them to develop plans to adapt similar solutions to their islands in a cost-efficient way. The size of the budget allocated to Follower islands should be clearly correlated to their level of involvement in the project’s activities. Follower islands participation will focus on exploring, planning and initiating the replication of the deployed solutions adapted to the different local conditions. This has to take the form of a detailed replication plan delivered by the end of the project.
The TRL will range between 5 and 8 (see part G of the General Annexes). Proposers will indicate the estimates levels of TRL at the beginning and at the end of the project.
Proposals will include a task on the analysis of obstacles to innovation under the current context and foresee the coordination on policy relevant issues (e.g. regulatory framework, business models, data management, consumer engagement) with similar EU-funded projects through the BRIDGE initiative[1]. An indicative budget share of at least 2% is recommended for the research work associated with these issues and an additional 2% for the coordination effort.
If relevant, projects should cooperate with the European Islands Facility (LC-SC3-ES-8-2019), and aim to establish synergies with ongoing and planned work on islands in the 'Clean Energy for EU islands' initiative[2].To support this, an indicative budget share of at least 2% of the EU contribution is recommended, which for example could include the development of practical training material and courses for island inhabitants, based on the chosen objectives and deliverables.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 5 to 7 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
The projects are expected to contribute to all the following impacts:
reduce significantly fossil fuel consumption, by developing renewable energy-based systems (including heating and cooling and storage) that allow the island to go towards full decarbonisation goals in a shorter time frame;
large-scale uptake of validated solutions on the same geographical island and/or on other geographical islands with similar problems;
Facilitate the creation and/or increase the number of renewable energy communities[3];
enhance stability of the power network for islands that are grid connected with the mainland.
Proposals are invited to include ad-hoc indicators to measure the progress against specific objectives of their choice that could be used to assess the progress during the project life. Indicators are expected to have clear and measurable targets. Proposals are also invited to identify if they impact on future investment perspectives (see also topic LC-SC3-ES-8-2019).

","Coordination and support action
","15 May 2018
","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Establishing the necessary infrastructure for safe and cost-effective CO2 transport and storage is of high importance in Europe. Early CCS projects will most likely explore CO2 storage sinks in the vicinity of capture points, and the required infrastructure will therefore most likely be initiated at national level in CO2 hubs and industrial clusters in order to achieve economies of scale by sharing CO2 transport and storage infrastructure. A cross border transport infrastructure is ultimately necessary to efficiently connect the CO2 hubs and industrial clusters to sinks.
Scope:
Elaboration of detailed plans for comprehensive European CO2 gathering networks and industrial clusters linked to CO2 storage sites via hubs, pipeline networks and shipping routes, with due attention to national and border-crossing permitting and regulatory issues. Mapping and understanding the nature and longevity of emission sources, identification of transport corridors and performing initial impact assessments, and developing local business models for delivery of CO2 capture, transport, utilisation and/or storage (including the separation of capture, transport, utilisation and storage responsibilities) within promising start-up regions. Industrial clusters may include for example power producers, cement and steel factories, chemical plants, refineries and hydrogen production facilities. A hubs-and-clusters approach could also include the coupling of hydrogen production and CCS, possibly using common infrastructure. The assessment of cost-effective ('bankable') storage capacity in selected regions is a key component of strategic planning, as it will provide additional certainty that the required CO2 storage capacity will be available when needed. Due attention has to be given to regions with potential for early onshore storage development (including enhanced oil recovery). Close cooperation with industrial players, as well as engagement with local stakeholders, is paramount. This includes identifying and involving relevant end users and societal stakeholders and analysing their concerns and needs using appropriate techniques and methods from the social sciences and humanities.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU in the range of EUR 2 to 3 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
Timely strategic planning will enable and accelerate the roll-out of a CCS infrastructure consisting of capture points and clusters, intermediate hubs, CO2 conversion facilities, safe and cost-effective CO2 transport and storage. Projects should pave the way for the development of operational storage sites as from the early 2020's, in particular linked to carbon-intensive industry. Proposals should clearly demonstrate how their outputs will contribute to achieving these expected impacts in the short term (up to 3 years), medium term (3-10 years) and long term (more than 10 years).

According to the JRC Smart Grid Projects Outlook 2014[1], the majority of cooperation takes place between organisations from a limited number of Member States while 15 analysed countries (NO, CH, IE, PL, HU, SK, LT, RO, LV, HR, BG, LU, CY, EE, MT) account for less than 5 % of the R&I funds altogether.
Scope:
The action should set-up a European Forum composed of R&I policy makers, R&I actors and experts ('community') in the field of smart grids / storage and local energy systems that is representative of the EU-28 energy system. The goal is to evolve towards a truly integrated pan-European R&I community with a high level of synergies, spread and representativity over a recommended duration of 4 years.
Actions should be proposed to establish and spread the state of the R&I in the field in Europe. A number of regional workshops where exchanges of experience and capacities between members of R&I community that are not used to collaborate will be organised where the key R&I challenges will be identified, discussed and structured. Advantage should be taken of other events and conferences, preferably well-known and occurring on a regular basis, to organise such workshops.
Beyond workshops, a methodology should be put in place that will allow developing the elements stated in the paragraph above on a long term perspective relying on diversified but combined means (virtual meeting, use of social media, setting up discussion groups, establishing collaborative working spaces). These new links, new knowledge and potential future collaboration should materialise through the delivery of reports (e.g. at regional and EU level).
The European Technology and Innovation Platform Smart Networks for Energy Transition (ETIP SNET), ongoing Horizon 2020 projects (e.g. the BRIDGE project[2]) in the field, and existing associations with a true pan-European dimension will have an important role to play. This action should also contribute to widen the representativity of European associations in the field which have weaknesses in their EU coverage.
The consortium should be composed of a limited number of relevant beneficiaries offering the possibility to invite ad-hoc R&I policy makers, actors and experts when needed. The consortium should achieve a well-balanced representation at EU level.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 3 to 4 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
The supported project is expected to contribute to:
Building a true pan-European R&I community in the field of smart grids & associated flexibility measures / energy systems;
Establish new collaboration on a long-term perspective which has a potential to develop into industrial collaborations;
Building, in the long-term, solidarity and trust for a well-functioning and resilient pan-European energy system (e.g. contributing to risk preparedness).

Commercialization of advanced biofuels depends on up-scaling of the technologies. The specific challenge is to overcome the high cost and high risk of the installation of industrial plants for advanced biofuels. This challenge is in line with priorities identified in the context of the SET-Plan[1]for commercialization of advanced biofuels.
Scope:
Proposals will demonstrate cost-efficient advanced biofuel pathways which improve the economic viability and reduce capital expenditure (CAPEX) and operating expenses (OPEX). This is to be done through retrofitting of existing industrial installations with necessary innovation specific to the proposed advanced biofuel pathway. Proposals will address integration in first generation biofuels sites, in pulp and paper industry or in existing fossil refineries with production of advanced biofuels at a scale of a few thousand tons through upgrading the existing sites with innovative installations. The economic feasibility and other socio-economic benefits including the impact on current first generation sites will be included and clearly demonstrated. Proposals will provide information about the expected CAPEX and OPEX improvements.
Proposals are expected to bring the technology from TRL 5 to 7 (please see part G of the General Annexes).
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 8 to 10 million would allow this challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
The supported projects are expected to increase the industrial installed capacity for advanced biofuels. and show the socio-economic benefits.

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Since the adoption of RES Directive in 2009, most Member States have experienced significant growth in renewable energy production and consumption, and both the EU and a large majority of Member States are on track towards the 2020 RES targets. At the same time the cost of energy from renewable energy sources has decreased significantly and the performance and market penetration of these sources has increased. Nevertheless, there is still a lot of market potential to be exploited. This potential is recognised in the ""Clean Energy for all Europeans"" package adopted at the end of 2016, which sets renewable energy targets for 2030 and introduces modifications in the energy market design, while empowering individuals or communities to participate actively to the energy system transformation. Furthermore, in June 2018 member states agreed to set an overall EU renewable energy target of 32% by 2030. Challenges exist for renewable energy to realise its full potential in all sectors and accelerate the clean energy transition, playing a crucial role in leading to an increased share of renewable energy consumed in the EU and to a more active role for the consumers.
The introduction and deployment of renewable energy at large scale requires overcoming a number of barriers. These cover issues such as consumer acceptance, legal and financial challenges related to the introduction of novel solutions into a technical and business environment with incumbent established solutions in place, necessity of making renewable energy solutions compliant with the new legislations, facilitation of legislative and regulatory aspects limiting innovative energy solutions implementation at the grid levels and also at the community or citizen level. Improving existing tools for better assessing the environmental, economic and social impact of renewable energy solutions is challenging due the breadth and scope of the different renewable technologies. The challenges are also related to creating a renewable energy sector fit for massive deployment in the market, which means ensuring that complete value chains for a broad range of renewable energy technologies are in place, not only covering raw materials (such as e.g. bioenergy feedstock) logistics but also components availability and operational reliability; and ensuring that renewables are fit to the market and capable to provide additional services to the grid. The energy markets outside the EU must not be forgotten, as they represent the most significant long term opportunity growth of the sector, but the penetration of these markets is a challenge in itself too.
Scope:
The proposal will develop solution(s) addressing one or more of the identified challenge(s), for the entire renewable energy sector or focusing on a specific energy market, such as electricity, heating, cooling or renewable fuels. The proposed solution can be developed to address a local challenge but should have wide potential for reapplication. The solution must have a long term viability and not be limited to an ad-hoc fix. The methodologies applied may be inspired by successful approaches already tested in other fields or contexts.
For all actions, the consortia have to involve and/or engage relevant stakeholders and market actors who are committed to adopting/implementing the results. The complexity of these challenges and of the related market uptake barriers may call for multi-disciplinary approaches, which should include contributions from the social sciences and humanities. Where relevant, regional specificities, socio-economic, gender-related, spatial and environmental aspects will be considered from a life-cycle perspective.
Where relevant, proposals are expected to also assess the legal, institutional and political frameworks at local, national and European level and examine how, why and under what conditions these (could) act as a barrier or an enabler.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 1 to 3 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
It is expected that the solution proposed will facilitate the wider uptake of renewable energy generation in the energy and industrial sectors leading to an increase share of renewable energy in the final energy consumption by 2030. The solution will contribute to substantial and measurable reductions in the project development timings and efforts, whilst fully addressing the needs for environmental impact assessments and public engagement. It will also contribute to provide a basis for the development of more informed policy, market support and financial frameworks, notably at national, regional and local level, leading to more cost effective support schemes and lower financing costs for RES facilities.

Achieving or maintaining global leadership in renewable energy technology requires that the innovative solutions are also affordable. Therefore cost reductions remain a crucial necessity for existing or new technologies. This specific challenge is in line with the sectorial cost reduction targets stated in the respective Declarations of Intent of the SET Plan[1], where applicable.
Scope:
Proposals will address one or more of the following issues:
Floating Wind – Technology development including reliable, sustainable and cost efficient anchoring and mooring system, dynamic cabling, installation techniques, and O&M concepts;
Onshore Wind - Disruptive technologies for the rotor, generator, drive train and support structures for the development of the advanced or next generation wind energy conversion systems;
Ocean: New integrated design and testing of tidal energy devices with behavioural modelling to achieve extended lifetime and high resistance in marine environment;
Geothermal: Novel drilling technologies need to be developed to reach cost-effectively depths in the order of 5 km and/or temperatures higher than 250°C;
CSP: Novel components and configurations for linear focusing and point focusing technologies need to be developed and tested;
Hydropower: Novel components for hydropower hydraulic and electrical machinery which allow efficient utilization also in off-design operation conditions, especially during ramp up and ramp down phases and reduce related machinery wear and tear;
Bioenergy: Improve small and medium-scale combined heat and power (CHP) from biomass to reduce overall costs of investments and operation through achieving at the same time high resource efficiency and high overall and electrical conversion performance.
Proposals are expected to bring technologies from TRL 3-4 to TRL 4-5 (please see part G of the General Annexes). Beside the development of the technology, the proposal will have to clearly address the following related aspects where relevant: potentially lower environmental impacts, issues related to social acceptance or resistance to new energy technologies, related socioeconomic issues.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 2 to 5 million would allow this challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.

","03 December 2019
","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
To achieve or maintain global leadership in geothermal energy technology cost reductions are crucial for existing and new technologies. In particular, well construction represents a considerable component of geothermal power plants’ overall investment. Consequently, lowering well cost (in terms of €/MWh) and reducing drill time or non-productive time would greatly facilitate their development. Advanced drilling technologies, currently not used in geothermal well construction, should therefore be developed and optimized.
This specific challenge is in line with the deep geothermal cost reduction targets stated in the SET-Plan Deep Geothermal Energy Implementation Plan[1].
Scope:
Proposals will address novel non-mechanical drilling technologies required for applications on all types of geological formations and with the ability to reach cost-effectively greater depths and higher temperatures (i.e. beyond 5 km and 250°C) or develop new mechanical-drilling operation technologies making use of digitisation, automation, machine learning, and innovative instrumentation.
Risk assessment and lifetime analysis of new technologies are expected to be part of the work. Innovative systems to avoid and/or reduce discharge of geothermal fluids into the environment should be considered, as well as horizontal - multilateral wells clusters in various geological formations. For this reason, appropriate technology transfer from the oil and gas sector on horizontal well drilling is encouraged, although it is not compulsory.
Proposals are expected to bring technologies from TRL 3-4 to TRL 4-5 (please see part G of the General Annexes).
Finally, proposals will have to clearly address relevant social acceptance and related socioeconomic issues.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 2 to 4 million would allow this challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Please note that this topic is part of the lump sum funding pilot scheme. Funding for grants awarded under this topic will take the form of lump sums as defined in the Commission Decision C(2017)7151 of 27 October 2017[2]. Details of the lump sum funding pilot scheme are published on the Funding & tender opportunities website[3] together with the specific Model Grant Agreement for Lump Sums[4] applicable"".
Expected Impact:
The proposed solution will contribute to meet key targets for drilling of the Deep Geothermal Implementation Plan of the SET-Plan[5]: reducing the unit cost of drilling (€/MWh) by 30% by 2030 and reducing drill time or non-productive time by 20% by 2025 and a total cost reduction on well completion of 20%.

The cost and efficiency of existing geothermal systems, mostly based on vertical wells, to provide heating and cooling in buildings being retrofitted or renovated are not very competitive in particular when digging is difficult. The challenge is to demonstrate the cost-effectiveness and efficiency of geothermal systems for heating and cooling in individual installations being retrofitted.
Scope:
Proposals shall target easy to install and efficient underground coupling systems for retrofitting existing types of buildings or adaptable to existing types of buildings, including historical buildings, to make geothermal energy a standard source of heat and cold in building renovation. The difficulties in drilling in built environments must be taken into consideration and properly addressed. Proposals might address the need for improved and more cost-efficient heat pumps to optimize the use of the energy generated by the proposed geothermal system. Synergies may be considered with activities initiated under the Energy Efficiency call topics EE-10-2016 and EE-11-2016.

It is essential to diversify the technology portfolio and feedstock basis to allow competitive production of advanced biofuels for use in transport.
The following sub-challenges should be addressed:
improving the technical and economic feasibility of the production of new and advanced liquid biofuels;
demonstrating the feasibility of using feedstock particularly suitable for transport energy purposes.
Scope:
Proposals shall aim at moving technologies that reached already TRL 5-6 to TRL 6-7 (please see part G of the General Annexes) through industrial demonstration projects in line with the Implementation Plan of the EIBI[1]. Projects should target the most promising advanced liquid biofuel production pathways incorporating new or improved biochemical/thermochemical/chemical conversion together with upgrading technologies and valorisation of co-products that improve the economic viability of the fuel production.
Environment, economic and social issues[2] including health and safety should be considered in the whole life cycle and appropriately addressed. A methodology that permits robust and reliable assessment of the environmental (notably in terms of GHG performance), economic and social benefits with respect to current technologies should be included.
The proposals should respect the principle of the minimum bioenergy content laid out in the EIBI Implementation Plan: 'At least 70% of the bioproducts produced by the plant shall be bioenergy (biofuels, heat, power) , calculated on energy basis.
Biofuels produced from starch, sugar and oil fractions of food/feed crops are excluded.
Proposals should address both sub-challenges described above, while the main effort in 2016 shall be in addressing sub-challenge a) and in 2017 sub-challenge b). Where synthesis gas or intermediate energy carriers are produced, their final use for production of advanced biofuels for transport must be demonstrated.
In particular, proposals shall address one of the following:
In 2016:
Biomass gasification to synthesis gas;
Biomass pyrolysis and torrefaction to intermediate bioenergy carriers (pyrolysis oils and torrefied biomass);
Biochemical conversion of lignocellulosic biomass sugars to hydrocarbons for diesel and jet engines;
In 2017:
Biofuels from the carbon content in flue gases of industrial wastes through biochemical and/or biological conversion;
Biofuels from aquatic biomass;
Liquid biofuels from wastes and residues (forest, agricultural, the organic fraction of municipal and industrial wastes).
Proposals shall explicitly address performance and cost targets together with relevant key performance indicators and the expected impacts. Industrial involvement in the consortium and explicit exploitation plans are a prerequisite.
Proposals shall include a work package on the business case of the technology solution and which identifies potential issues of public acceptance, market and regulatory barriers, including standardisation needs. It should also address, where appropriate, synergies between new and existing technologies and other socio-economic and environmental aspects from a life-cycle perspective. Furthermore, they shall address the risks (technological, business, process) and their possible mitigation.
Opening the project's test sites, pilot and demonstration facilities, or research infrastructures for practice oriented education, training or knowledge exchange is encouraged.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 10 to 15 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
Demonstrating advanced biofuel technologies at large industrial scale reduces the technological risks and paves the way for subsequent first-of-a-kind industrial projects. For this purpose, the scale of the proposals should permit obtaining the data and experience required so that up-scaling to a first-of-a-kind, industrial project can be envisaged as a next step. Favourable energy and GHG balances are expected. The demonstrated industrial concepts should ensure the techno-economic feasibility of the entire value chain and have the potential for a significant social and economic impact, notably in terms of job creation, economic growth and safe and affordable energy supply.

","Innovation action
","11 May 2017
","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
In spite of the improvements in recent years, water and cost-competitiveness remain a crucial barriers to the deployment of CSP plants especially in arid areas. The challenge is to drastically reduce water consumption as well as costs thereby contributing to achieving the SET-Plan targets for CSP[1].
Scope:
Projects shall demonstrate cost-effective technical solutions which significantly reduce or replace the water consumption of CSP plants. The demonstration shall take place in a region with very good solar resource values (Direct Normal Irradiation > 2000 kWh/m2 year).
Since the availability of water resources particularly in arid areas is linked to broader socioeconomic and livelihood issues and therefore of particular relevance to local communities, multidisciplinary research designs that integrate contributions also from the social sciences and humanities are encouraged. Engaging and involving local communities, and further investigating the roots of social acceptance or any resistance to CSP plants, so as to develop mitigating strategies or alternative solutions, should likewise be part of the project.
TRL 7 shall be achieved at the end of project activities (please see part G of the General Annexes).
Opening the project's test sites, pilot and demonstration facilities, or research infrastructures for practice oriented education, training or knowledge exchange is encouraged.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 10 to 12 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts
Expected Impact:
The action will result in significant exploitation prospects for the European technology in the field of CSP deployment, bringing cost effective solutions that improve the environmental profile.
Cross-cutting Priorities:
Socio-economic science and humanities
[1]The Steering Group of the SET-Plan has agreed on the following two targets for CSP: (i) 40% cost reduction by 2020 (from 2013) translating into a supply price < 10 c€/kWh for a radiation of 2050 kWh/m2/year (average in Southern Europe); and (ii) new cycles (including supercritical ones) with a first demonstrator by 2020."

","Innovation action
","11 May 2016
","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Scaling up in the ocean energy sector to arrays is a fundamental challenge to be addressed in order to show a reduction of the cost of energy while mastering the risks at project level. There is significant learning to be captured through the demonstration of arrays.
Scope:
Applying projects will have to clearly describe the selected technology. The chosen project technology will have to bring evidence at the date of application of previous technology demonstration in real conditions connected to the grid to enhance the likely success of the project and provide a clear cost reduction roadmap that deploying in the pilot project will achieve. Installing more than one technology in the same array is permitted, but this should clearly have added value to this action. The installation has to be grid-connected.
The project has to include a clear go/no go moment ahead of entering the deployment phase. Before this go/no go moment, the project has to deliver the detailed engineering plans, a complete business and implementation plan and all needed permits for the deployment of the array. A committee of independent experts will assess all deliverables and will give advice for the go/no decision.
TRL 7 should be achieved at the end of the project activities (please see part G of the General Annexes).
Opening the project's test sites, pilot and demonstration facilities, or research infrastructures for practice oriented education, training or knowledge exchange is encouraged.
Ocean energy projects are part of complex marine ecosystems, with links to broader environmental, socioeconomic and livelihood issues that are of particular relevance to local communities. Actions to engage and involve local communities, to further improve social acceptance are encouraged.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 10 and 15 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
The action will deliver a cost-effective array and hence will demonstrate pathways to reduce the cost of energy. It is expected that as a result of this action, ocean energy would become more commercially attractive for investors. The action should contribute to the strengthening the European industrial technology base in the ocean energy field, thereby creating growth and jobs in Europe.

","Research and Innovation action
","11 December 2013
","28 August 2014","Scope:
Specific challenge: The aviation sector contributes 2% to the EU GDP. It is also an important source of jobs creating directly 1.7 million jobs (among which 480 000 skilled jobs in aeronautics) and supporting another 2 million indirect jobs. The aeronautics sector alone generates a turnover of EUR 70 billion and exports 60% of its production. With 12% of its turnover invested in research and innovation, aeronautics is one of the most research intensive sectors and is one of the world leaders in terms of production, employment and exports. The long life cycle of aircraft requires long term investments with high risks. In order to preserve its leadership and jobs, the European aviation industry must have the capacity to deliver the best products and services in a time and cost efficient manner and to offer new and innovative products, vehicles and services, with improved environmental performance.
Scope: Regarding aircraft, research and innovation actions could target the development of technologies and methodologies which have the potential to save costs and time across the whole life cycle of the aircraft (design, production, maintenance, overhaul, repair and retrofit), including for certification aspects. Research and innovation actions could also target the integration of additional functions (e.g. sensing, actuating) or materials in structural components of the aircraft, the increased use of automation and artificial intelligence in control systems allowing versatility and new capabilities or to provide passenger with additional services on-board of the aircraft or at the airport.
Regarding air transport operations, research and innovation actions could target cost efficiency of ground operations, as well as innovative approaches which can reduce the needs or accelerate the pace of the training of personnel.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 5 to 8 million each would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting smaller or larger amounts.
Expected impact: Actions will demonstrate in a quantified manner their potential to mature the Technology Readiness Level (TRL; please see part G of the General Annexes), in the range 1-6, of technologies and concepts that can make a significant contribution towards the following high level goals by 2050 with reference year 2000:
      The whole Europe aviation industry is strongly competitive and retains leading edge design, manufacturing and system integration capabilities and associated jobs thanks to significantly decreased development costs (including a reduction of costs of certification by 50%).
Actions will also provide ad-hoc indicators to measure the expected progress in terms of, for example, reduction of production or certification times and costs, when comparing the situation before the start of the action and after the implementation of its results. In the case of novel products and services, the potential markets will be identified together with the potential corresponding volumes / value.
