","Research and Innovation action
","11 December 2013
","28 August 2014","Scope:
Specific challenge: A number of very ambitious goals have been set by the sector at horizon 2050 in the Strategic Research and Innovation Agenda (SRIA) of the Advisory Council for Aviation Research and Innovation in Europe (ACARE). Many of these goals will not be reached through an evolutionary approach only. Breakthrough innovations are needed, i.e. new solutions which rely on a disruption with respect to current approaches.
Scope: The proposed research and innovation actions could address the vehicles as well as the air transport system. Regarding vehicles, research and innovation actions could target new technologies and concepts that are not currently used in aeronautics or that have not yet being put in combination in the aviation sector. This could be, for example, radical new approaches to propulsion, to the use of energy, new types of vehicles, etc.
Regarding the air transport system, the proposed research and innovation actions could address radical new concepts for the way vehicles, passengers and freight are handled in airports, the type of handling and servicing equipment used, the way airports are organised and connected to other modes, the way information is shared, used and handled on the landside part of the airport.
The proposals should aim at demonstrating the validity of the technologies and concepts following a sound technical and scientific approach. The performance should be assessed preferably quantitatively against the relevant criteria such as for example economic viability, time efficiency, safety, potential to cope with evolutions of regulations, passenger friendliness, social acceptance, etc. Considering that a large fraction of air pollution on airports is caused by handling and servicing, aspects of environmental friendliness and energy sustainability should be taken into account. The actions should also assess at the end of the project the potential of the technologies to be developed at further technology readiness levels and barriers that could prevent such developments.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 2 to 4 million each would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected impact: Actions will demonstrate their potential to mature the Technology Readiness Level (TRL; please see part G of the General Annexes) in the range 1-2, to prepare the ground for future highly innovative breakthrough products and services for European aviation which will contribute to decrease the environmental impact, enhance the competitiveness, the mobility and the levels of safety. Actions will also provide ad-hoc indicators to evaluate the potential improvements that the breakthrough technology / concept is capable of bringing, using realistic hypothesis and scenarios.

","single-stage
Deadline date","Scope:
Specific challenge: The European aviation sector should have access to a highly skilled workforce which can rely on a strong scientific knowledge base to be able to properly address the environmental and competitiveness challenges facing both the aeronautics and the air transport sectors. Two specific domains have to be addressed:
1.    To analyse and define the evolving skill needs of the sector and propose changes to the education of aviation engineers accordingly, and to attract more young people to aviation careers.
2.    To reduce the fragmentation in the dissemination of scientific and technical knowledge in Europe and enhance its global impact.
Scope: Proposals should address fully one of the two following domains:
1.    Regarding the education of aviation engineers in Europe, the scope of the action is to identify the skill needs in the sector, propose improvements including on gender issue and further contribute to the harmonisation of the content of the curricula for aviation engineers towards the creation of a Europe wide system. The action should also develop and share outreach material and organise events to attract young people to studies leading to aviation careers. The initiative should build on existing mechanisms and associations. The consortium should include representatives from the aviation industry, research establishments and education institutions so that the proposed solutions can acquire recognition and support from these different stakeholders.
2.    Regarding the dissemination of scientific and technical knowledge, the scope of the action is to create a Europe wide coordination mechanism gathering a representative group of associations active in the field of aviation to harmonise and rationalise conferences, events and publications. The action will contribute to enhance the impact and accessibility of publications relevant to European aviation, in particular those issued from EU funded projects. The actions should aim at being self-supportable after the end of the project.
Expected impact:
Regarding domain 1, the proposed actions will demonstrate their capacity to contribute to increase the attractiveness, quality, coherence and relevance of the curricula, enhance teaching methods and the profile of engineers matching the evolving and growing needs of the sector. The potential impact should be expressed in the light of the number of engineers which could benefit from the improvements and time / manpower savings when compared to the extra time young engineers need to adapt / train under the current situation before they can be operational.
Regarding domain 2, the proposed actions will contribute to raise the impact and visibility of European conferences and events, to optimise the number and the yearly calendar of events and enhance the impact factor of scientific publications, their availability and access, in particular for those created in EU funded projects. The impact should be expressed in terms of: the time that could be saved for scientists / researchers when participating to conferences resulting from an optimised calendar of events, the time that could be saved in the search of information resulting from a centralised and structured approach to publications repository and the potential gain in impact factor resulting from an organised approach to EU-based journals. The gain of attractiveness of the European scientific dissemination system (compared to the US or other regions of the world) should be assessed qualitatively.

","single-stage
Deadline date","Scope:
Specific challenge: The Strategic Research and Innovation Agenda (SRIA) of the Advisory Council for Aviation Research and Innovation in Europe (ACARE) identified a number of domains where policy support is needed. The following two domains call for urgent actions:
1.    Door-to-door travel involving air transport is currently far from being seamless and therefore, based on the analysis of the current system, conceptual foundations of a novel system should be studied and proposed.
1.    Certification, which is a key element to guarantee the safety of the air transport system, can be time consuming and costly; in addition, new approaches to certification have to be found to cope with novel technologies never used before. Therefore, innovative approaches to this process should be envisaged and studied.
Scope: Proposals should address fully one of the two following domains:
1.    Regarding seamless door to door travel involving air transport, the proposed actions should investigate the profile of customers and better understand their expectations, needs and requirements by collecting data and analysing the current European air transport system and its connections from a user’s perspective. The current effectiveness of traffic flows should be assessed and metrics developed in order to identify the main areas to be improved (information to passengers, luggage handling, predictability, etc.) as well as the drivers and choice parameters such as infrastructure, connectivity, income level, regional aspects, etc. which influence the travel behaviour. On this basis, the action should then develop a concept for a system that is capable of providing a door-to-door service to the customers, establish the broad lines of the architecture of this system, assess the feasibility and economic viability of the concept (cost-benefit analysis) and propose key performance indicators.
2.    Regarding certification, the proposed actions should aim to review the current existing approaches (i.e. including outside of Europe) and identify which new tools and new methods could be used to accelerate the certification process (e.g. alternative means of compliance, adaptability to new concepts or technologies), lower its costs while ensuring the requested level of safety. The action requires the involvement of the key stakeholders who have authority and the capacity to act on the certification process, notably EASA (this does not necessarily require that these stakeholders are participants to the Proposal).
Expected impact: The proposed actions will pave the way for future research and innovation actions contributing to the following high level goals for the 2050 time horizon:
1.    90% of the travellers within Europe are able to complete their journey within 4 hours door to door. In order to guarantee its impact, the proposal should give indication on the methods and sources of data that are planned to be used to study customer profiles and traffic flows and assess the statistical representativeness. It should also present a sound dissemination plan, demonstrate that the results will be communicated to the appropriate stakeholders and, in particular to the potential partners that would be needed to initiate the first research and innovation actions.
2.    The certification process is time efficient, its costs have been reduced by 50% (with reference to year 2000) while ensuring the required levels of safety and gaining global acceptance. In order to guarantee its impact, the proposal should demonstrate that the results will be communicated to the appropriate stakeholders and that the dissemination mechanism is capable of gaining endorsement and commitment at high level.

","Research and Innovation action
","20 September 2016
","19 October 2017","Specific Challenge:
Very ambitious long-term goals are addressed by Europe's vision for aviation Flightpath 2050, in particular for maintaining and extending industrial leadership and for protecting the environment. As many evolutionary technologies are mature near to their maximum potential, new disruptive breakthrough technologies are needed to reach these ambitious goals.
Scope:
The aim is to develop exploitable breakthrough technologies and concepts for the medium term that are not currently used or that have not yet being put in combination for civil aviation. The actions should target technologies and concepts that are at low Technology Readiness Level today (up to TRL 3) and can potentially achieve Technology Readiness Level 6 by 2030-2035. The actions should focus to airframe, propulsion and on-board systems & equipment, including their integration and may challenge established practices. The proposals may also include the advancement of numerical and experimental methods towards validating the proposed concepts. The actions should address one or several of the following areas:
―Innovative aircraft configurations and airframes (e.g. short take-off and landing, long wing span; personal vehicles).
―Propulsion systems (e.g. partially or fully embedded within the airframe; distributed propulsion technologies and revolutionary engine cycles; high-speed propulsion).
―Novel and integrated multifunctional systems.
―Autonomous, intelligent and evolving systems (e.g. Remotely Piloted Aircraft Systems).
The proposals should include a quantitative preliminary assessment against the relevant criteria (for example, economic viability, time efficiency, safety, potential to cope with evolutions of regulations, human factor considerations such as passenger friendliness, social acceptance, etc.). They should also assess the potential of the technologies to be developed further and identify regulatory, technological and socio-economic barriers that could prevent such developments.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 2 to 4 million each would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
Actions will propose new or develop further highly innovative and exploitable breakthrough technologies for the medium term that will make feasible a substantial decrease of the impact on climate and the environment of air vehicles and/or enhance the competitiveness of the European aviation industry and the safety of civil aviation. They should demonstrate the proof of concept and consider integration issues without assuming fundamental changes at airport level. Proposals are also expected to demonstrate the validity of the technologies and concepts following a sound technical and scientific approach as well as significant decrease in the environmental impact and/or high potential for new market opportunities for the European aviation industry.
